            <p>Saw <a href="http://www.mulhollanddrive.com">Mulholland Drive</a> last night. David Lynch is odd. Definitely a movie that needs to be watched at least twice. I only partially understood it until I read <a href="http://dir.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2001/10/23/mulholland_drive_analysis/index.html">this</a>.</p>

            <p>Saw <a href="http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/thegoodgirl/index.html">Good Girl</a> last night. I don’t like Jennifer Aniston and I think Friends is just about the dumbest show on TV, but this was a really good movie and she was very good in it. But I will never move to Texas.</p>

<p>Going to see <a href="http://www.mulhollanddrive.com/">Mulholland Drive</a> tonight.</p>

            <p>When I used Windows I loved <a href="http://www.textpad.com">TextPad</a>, because it does everything I need for writing code and html for .  Since I’ve been on the Mac, I’ve been looking for a replacement.  <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml">BBEdit</a> Pro does what I need – though not as elegantly as the simple TextPad – but $150 seems like a lot to pay for an editor (the free Lite version does not do syntax highlighting).  I thought <a href="http://www.ragesw.com/webdesign.php">Web Design</a> was the answer but despite Preferences which suggest you can set extensions for appropriate syntax highlighting, I can’t get the darn thing to open any file with an extension other than html/xml/php.  Troy uses vi, but I know <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/02/21/vi_intro.html">this much</a> about vi, which is just good enough to get my cvs comments in and it drives me nuts.  UPDATE…
<!-- more -->
Email to the creator of WebDesign and I’m provided a workaround within 3 hours and the offer of a private build that will be even easier within a day.  I’m evaluating it for now, but I think it might be my solution.  Meanwhile BBEdit introduces a low end version for a cheaper price point (TextWrangler) but it too misses syntax highlighting.</p>

            <p>Just days after <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2003/02/18/technology/overture/index.htm">buying AltaVista</a>, Overture is <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/29469.html">buying</a> <a href="http://www.fastsearch.com/">FAST</a>, which gives them AllTheWeb.</p>

<p>So here we are… <a href="http://yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> owns <a href="http://inktomi.com">Inktomi</a>, <a href="http://askjeeves.com">AskJeeves</a> owns <a href="http://teoma.com">Teoma</a> and <a href="http://overture.com">Overture</a> owns <a href="http://altavista.com">AltaVista</a> and <a href="http://fastsearch.com">FAST</a>. This is good because Google needs competitors; Google is increasingly bad at finding what I need and Google is becoming far too powerful. Or is everyone just doing a land grab before <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/business/DailyNews/google020618.html">Google’s inevitable IPO</a> when they could generate enough cash to buy all the other search engines?</p>

<p>Along these lines, I wish Apple would add other search engines to the Google bar in <a href="http://apple.com/safari">Safari</a>.</p>
