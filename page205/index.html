          <p>Our friend <a href="http://mikeandkiernan.blogspot.com/2005/06/we-have-some-sad-news-last-tuesday.html">Kiernan’s father passed away</a> last week.  Coincidentally, <a href="http://www.insertcardfully.com/2005/05/play_a_game_of_.html">Elizabeth’s father died last month</a>.  Perhaps our blogroll is cursed.  Perhaps people just die, when you least and most expect it.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.roadcycling.com/news/article1187.shtml">David Cohen</a> of RoadCycling.com says that Armstrong won’t win the Tour this year because the other riders are younger and more motivated to win. I don’t buy it, they were younger last year and why weren’t they motivated to prevent him from winning his 5th or the record-breaking 6th?</p>

<p><a href="http://olntv.com">Outdoor Life Network</a> did their final “Road to the Tour” yesterday and Phil Liggett was sure favoring Armstrong and proclaiming that this year’s Discovery Team is the strongest team Lance has had in the Tour. He even said disagreed with Lance saying that <a href="http://www.t-mobile-team.com/cms/tmoteam/en/team/team2005/riders/templateId=renderInternalPage/contentID=8122/id=9158.html">Andreas Kloden</a>, a strong contender, is “riding like a sack of potatoes”. :)</p>

<p>T-Mobile has the second strongest team, in my opinion, but whether they’re all motivated to help <a href="http://www.t-mobile-team.com/cms/tmoteam/en/team/team2005/riders/templateId=renderInternalPage/contentID=8176/id=9158.html">Jan Ullrich</a> win is the question. <a href="http://www.t-mobile-team.com/cms/tmoteam/en/team/team2005/riders/templateId=renderInternalPage/contentID=8194/id=9158.html">Vinokourov</a> could be better than Ullrich. And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Basso">Ivan Basso</a> is another threat.</p>

<p>Regardless, it should be a good Tour this year!</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Steve Jobs <a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html">spoke at Stanford’s graduation</a> last weekend. For someone who is famously private, he’s surprisingly candid about his life and career. Here’s some good advice:</p>

<blockquote>Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle.</blockquote>

<p>When I was a kid and accidentally discovered how much fun I had making software, I watched Apple become a great company (the first time) and saw Steve Jobs as a true visionary. His recent return to Apple proves it all over again. I’ve always admired his ability to get to the point in his businesses and deliver great stuff. After reading his speech, I admire his ability to do the same with life.</p>

<p>This is a shot on the ferry leaving Vashon and going to Seattle, where we attended the wedding of Gay’s cousin Saturday night.</p>

<!-- more -->
It’s a famous hotel in San Diego, built in 1888 and restored in the 20th century. All in all, a nicer hotel with more friendly staff than the <a href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/whotels/index.html">W</a> in downtown, and half the price!</p>

<p>We flew back Tuesday afternoon and arrived in rainy Seattle and home at 7pm. Gay’s dad and aunt stayed at the house while we were gone and they really tired Ouzo out, which is not easy.</p>
