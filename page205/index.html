A couple days ago, Ouzo tore one of them on his hind leg. So today was his surgery to have his rear duclaws removed. He’s back home and very groggy, which, if you know Ouzo, is strange.</p>

<p>We’ll see how long his bandages last before he chews them off. My guess is that they’re gone tomorrow afternoon.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375412913/recipezaar-20/"><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/lunarpark.jpg" alt="lunar park" /></a>I never win anything, but today I won a signed copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375412913/recipezaar-20/">Bret Easton Ellis’s new novel “Lunar Park”</a> – kind of silly, given I’ve already purchased and read the book (which I really liked, but that’s another entry).  I won the book because <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/eastonellis/game.php">my team, The Tardy Terbys, wrote the winning story</a> in an online game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse">Exquisite Corpse</a>, a surrealist, literary game of telephone, where each person only sees the last sentence written in a collaborative story.</p>

<p>The game is perfectly suited for online play, and the design company the built the software did a good job.  You sign up and are placed on a team.  You get email letting you know when it is your turn to play with a link to a website that displays only the last sentence contributed with a field to add yours.  We wrote the story very quickly, and from the sentences I saw there were some talented and imaginative writers in our random group.  I can’t really see how the game helps market the book at all, but it was one of the more creative online tie-in games I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>If other Tardy Terbys find this, please sign in.  It is so fun to have won something as a team of strangers.</p>

          </h3>
            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/Picture1.png" alt="" />The Steelers absolutely crushed the Titans today, 34-7. It started out badly, the Titans easily marched down the field on the first possession for a touchdown. I started getting bad feelings about the season. A rookie running back replacing the veterans Staley and Bettis, a second-year quarterback that finished last year poorly, a great receiver traded. But the Steelers scored on their first possession and didn’t stop scoring when they got the ball til the 4th quarter. The Titans didn’t punt either til the 4th quarter, but that’s just because they kept turning the ball over. Their offense was worthless. And this rookie running back, Willie Parker, had a great first game of his career.</p>

            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/Picture6.png" alt="" /><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/Picture7.png" alt="" />This summer has been lacking in good new music, it’s been so bad it’s hard to even find a mediocre CD to buy. The only two good CDs I’ve heard in months are <a href="http://www.deathcabforcutie.com/">Death Cab For Cutie</a>’s <em>Plans</em> and the self-titled <a href="http://clapyourhandssayyeah.com/shows.php">Clap Your Hands Say Yeah!</a>, which was recommended by our hip New York friend, <a href="http://www.netomat.net/people/team.php">Cindy</a> (who also got us into <a href="http://www.blocparty.com/go.php?object=home">Bloc Party</a>, which was our soundtrack through France in July).</p>

<p>I liked DCFC’s <em>Transatlanticism</em>, but <em>Plans</em> is even better – not terribly innovative, just all-around good music. <em>Clap Your Hands Say Yeah!</em> is a little like Talking Heads and generally reminds me of good 80s music.</p>
