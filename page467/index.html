          <p>In the worst economy the US has seen in 70 years, MS is growing by outrageous rates and mostly due to sales of the most expensive operating system ever sold. Makes no sense. <a href="http://rss.com.com/2100-1001-962470.html?type=pt&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=news">Licensing buoys Microsoft again - Tech News - CNET.com</a>: <em>Revenue grew 26 percent to $7.75 billion from $6.13 billion a year earlier. Sequentially, sales jumped from $7.25 billion in the fourth fiscal quarter.</em></p>

          <p><a href="http://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2002/wired-interview/">An Interview With Douglas Bowman of Wired News</a>. Page layout without tables!:  <em>By eliminating tables that were strictly used for layout, we significantly cut back on the amount of markup and useless tags in our html, and gained a structure that is much easier to maintain. Now that the content is not locked into a specific table structure, we have much more flexibility in how we present that content. A few changes to the CSS can completely alter the presentation of thousands of pages. As a very welcome side benefit, we also believe the accessibility of Wired News will dramatically improve without the clutter of nested layout tables.</em></p>
