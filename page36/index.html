          <p>Americans spent $1.5 billion on lottery tickets just for this one. 25% of that, $375 million, pays for government services. 44 states participate, so on average, my state received $8.5 million. With a population of 6.8 million, I receive $1.25 in government services for free. Even better, <a href="http://m.cbsnews.com/storysynopsis.rbml?pageType=eveningNews&amp;catid=57407364&amp;feed_id=29">Americans spend $56 billion</a> on lottery tickets every year, or 37 times as much, so I receive an estimated $46.25 in government services every year without spending a penny. That’s $231.25 for my family each year. Thank you lottery players, keep it up!</p>

<blockquote>In other words, Americans may protest loudly, but their economic behavior indicates a remarkable indifference to the price of oil. In Europe, where taxes keep gas prices well above $5 a gallon, citizens are more likely to take public transportation and live near the center of town. The streets are filled with mopeds and tiny cars. The United States, on the other hand, barely exerts the minimum effort expected of a gas-phobic society: its enthusiasm for car pooling, enhanced public transportation and fuel-efficient vehicles remains relatively low. The average American even spends more gas money on social and recreational trips (about $13 a week, on average) than on their commutes to and from work (around $8). If gas prices truly damage the quality of our lives, we have done a remarkable job of hiding it.</blockquote>
