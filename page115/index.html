            <p>We invited Mark, Lee and Eric over for dinner at our apartment. Gay made a roasted lamb with potatoes and asparagus, Lee made a mint sauce and Mark made drinks with Pimm’s. They gave Havana a book, which was very thoughtful, and Lee read it to her at the end of the evening. Mark then read one of her other new books to her as well.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>After a week in London, I’ve found two notable things about beers here. One is good: low-alcohol beers. The other is less good: taste.</p>

<p>First, on taste, I’m disappointed in the beers here. Many years ago, if you wanted good beer you looked for a beer from Germany or England for the finest beers. That was when Anheuser-Busch, Miller and Coors ruled the beer world in the US. If you wanted a lager, you found a German beer. If you wanted ale, the UK made the best. Not anymore. America’s craft beer industry has done an amazing thing for the reputation of American beer.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Fuller’s, a UK beer, is still my all-around favorite beer in the sense that if I could only have one beer the rest of my life, it’d be a Fuller’s ESB – it’s good all year round, bitter but not too bitter, and very drinkable. And I have enjoyed an ESB in the rare times when I can find it. I’ve even come to like their London Pride which, thankfully, is readily available. I also find it interesting to drink the low-carbonated hand pump cask beers (“real ales” to purists) mostly because those are so rare in the US. I’d prefer ESB to be more carbonated but the freshness is hard to beat. But I haven’t had an English beer that I’d ask for twice since I’ve been here.</p>

<p>One notable exception to this English beer problem is a beer I found in a grocery store: Meantime London Stout. It’s still not as good as the best stouts available in America, but it’s head and shoulders above any other English beer available here, in my experience. Meantime is a brewery I’ve heard good things about while in the US and didn’t realize they were located in England. It makes sense, they’re in Greenwich, as in Greenwich Mean Time. Of course, no pub that I’ve found serves any Meantime beers.</p>

<p>Last night I had a Leffe Blonde, mostly because I’d had all the other beers at the bar. In 2005, I really liked Leffe Dark but not Leffe Blonde. Maybe I’m used to the less flavorful British beers because Leffe Blonde, a blonde ale mind you, which means it’s supposed to be lighter in flavor, was astonishingly flavorful! Leffe is Belgian, not British, though.</p>

<p>The hop levels are also very low, despite most of the beers being called “bitters”. I’d hardly call anything I’ve had here “bitter”. Even their IPAs, which are billed as having a hoppier aroma and bitter taste, are only subtly more hoppier. Frankly, I wouldn’t know an IPA from a bitter here.</p>

<p>I have been very happy to discover that beers here are so low in alcohol. Beers seem to be mostly in the low 4% range of alcohol, which is about where drek like Budweiser is, and many as low as 3.7%. Budweiser is low in alcohol because they dilute their beer with corn and rice rather than 100% malted barley, which provides less sugars for the yeast to ferment into alcohol. Budweiser does it to keep their costs low (corn and rice is cheaper than barley) and to keep flavors to a minimum (corn and rice lack the richer flavor found in barley) because most Americans prefer their beer to taste more like water than beer. In comparison, British beers have much more flavor (and color) but they somehow manage to keep the alcohol low.</p>

<p>The alcohol content is also prominently displayed on the taps. This is why Brits can drink beer at lunch and have several pints after work. London Pride, for example, has 4.1% and ESB has 5.5%. At one pub, a drunk patron started a conversation with Havana and noticed we were drinking the “very strong” ESB. I think this might be why ESB is so hard to find, people don’t want such a strong beer. In comparison, a 7% alcohol beer is what I normally drink, 9% is also common (Old Rasputin) and I start to be careful when I have a 10-13%. 18% beers like 120 Minute IPA that sometimes make me suffer at their bitterness would absolutely devastate a British beer-drinker in terms of both alcohol and hoppiness!</p>

<p>There’s a relatively new official style of beer called “session beers”. This is a beer with less than 5% alcohol and is meant to be a beer that you can have in “drinking sessions”, i.e., lots of beers right after another without getting too drunk. Most British beers classify as session beers!</p>

<p>Aside from English beers, all pubs have a selection of imports. These almost always include Kronenburg, Heineken, Stella Artois and Guinness Stout. Those are three beers I don’t even look at in the US. There’s usually a tap or three of other beers from Europe. These are all on a CO2 which is nice for a change from the less-carbonated cask beers.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We planned to head out to Hampton Court for a food festival going on this weekend with Mark, Lee, Eric, Lee’s sister and her family. But after the kids’ afternoon nap and getting them ready and to the train station, we wouldn’t have made out there until 4pm or so. So instead, we walked up to a very crowded Regent Street to <a href="http://www.hamleys.com/">Hamley’s Toy Store</a>, the FAO Schwarz of London. Havana is still too young to understand what a toy store is, she seemed to think it’s just a big playroom. She immediately spied the train sets – Thomas &amp; Friends train sets. I don’t think she recognized Thomas (a children’s show narrated by George Carlin, Alec Baldwin and others), she just seems to love all trains.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>The store was so crowded that we gave up waiting in line for the elevator (“the lift”) to take the stroller on that we took the stroller up the escalator. It was actually pretty easy to do and Hudson, who had fallen asleep, didn’t even wake up. We got her a couple books, let her walk around and play with some toys and then escaped the crowds. We stopped for a quick snack and Havana had us read both books to her while we sat on a wall a block off Regent.</p>

<p>We walked through another shopping district and I finally picked up a belt, since I’d forgotten to pack one. Yesterday we stopped in <a href="http://www.selfridges.com/">Selfridges</a>, on the recommendation of Mark, where I found a belt that I liked, but it was Prada so naturally, it cost £225 ($350). Who pays that?</p>

<p>We then hopped in a taxi to Clerkenwell, where we stayed when we were here in 2005, and went to <a href="http://www.urbanpath.com/london/pubs/the-eagle.htm">The Eagle</a>. The Eagle was the first gastropub in London and started the gastropub style of restaurant. We intended to eat here in 2005 but never got around to it, so this time we made the effort and we’re glad we did. This was the best dinner we’ve had yet in London.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3557713060/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3321/3557713060_78130f1f61.jpg" alt="The Eagle gastropub" /></a></p>

<p>The place is very casual, you just come in and sit down. There’s no waiters, you order your food at the bar from the chalkboard menus. It was also very kid-friendly, the staff and many of the customers interacted with Havana and it was so loud that Hudson’s squawking didn’t bother anyone.</p>

<p>After dinner, we walked around Clerkenwell and happened upon a playground that looked like the Teletubbies film set. Havana saw it and made a dash for it yelling “Playground! Playground!”. After she’d been on everything and gotten all her energy out, we grabbed a taxi home. We had them in bed before 10pm, which we consider an accomplishment on this trip.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Another day of walking all around. Havana loves to walk but we’re getting tired of walking and pushing a stroller around all day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3554350497/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3655/3554350497_314869361c.jpg" alt="Walking Hyde Park (4 of 4)" /></a></p>

<p>Sometimes before a nap the kids will wind down giving us signs that it’s time for their rest, but other times, like today, they show no signs of tiring until you look down and see their head leaning to the side and their eyes closed. Both Havana and Hudson took their afternoon naps in the stroller being wheeled around noisy and bumpy streets of London. They don’t complain and seem to be just as happy to keep going after they wake up, but I think it’s time to plan some destinations and make use of taxis and/or the Tube so they can get proper naps in beds.</p>

<p>We went to dinner at <a href="http://www.therunningfootman.biz/Only/theOnly.asp">The Only Running Footman</a> and had the upstairs dining room almost completely to ourselves, which makes it easier to have dinner with kids. But people started showing up at the same time the kids started getting tired and cranky. I see earlier dinners in our future and very few nice restaurants.</p>

            <p>When we had <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/05/18/mark-lee/">dinner with Mark and Lee</a> earlier this week, they suggested dinner on Thursday and Lee arranged for his niece Aimee to babysit Havana and Hudson so we could go out for a nice dinner. Mark and Aimee arrived out our apartment at 6:30pm and we buzzed them in. Havana and Gay waited at the door while Havana asked “Where’s Uncle Mark?” and suddently Eric popped up the stairs!</p>

<p>The last we heard from Eric he was in India on <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/27/erics-around-the-world-trip/">his around the world trip</a>, we hadn’t heard from him in many weeks and hadn’t seen him in over 10 months, so it was quite a surprise. Mark took some video of Gay’s face which I’m looking forward to seeing. When he heard through Mark that we were going to be in London, he decided to take a detour on his trip and come visit London and spend a few weeks in Europe.</p>

<p>After giving Aimee the rundown on the kids while we waited for Lee to arrive, we took a walk across Hyde Park into Kensington. The weather is perfect these days and it was a nice almost-sunset walk through the Park. They took us to <a href="http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/pubsandbars/the-prince-regent-review-18040.html">The Prince Regent</a> gastropub for dinner.</p>

<p>After dinner, we walked around Kensington for a while and then took a cab back to Mayfair for a beer at one of our neighborhood pubs.</p>
