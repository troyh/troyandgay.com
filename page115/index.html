          <p>She’s getting tall enough to ride her tricycle, but her legs are just a tad too short to reach the pedal at its furthest point. She can now turn the pedals several turns but if she doesn’t give enough push on the downward stroke the pedal doesn’t get all the way around. And she doesn’t quite have the hang of turning the wheel to steer yet.</p>

<p>She sings a song that goes “Pedals and wheels, pedals and wheels” as she rides it. I don’t know if that’s a made-up song or something she heard somewhere.</p>

          <p>Today is the first sunny day, so Havana got to hunt for Easter eggs today instead of on Sunday.</p>

<p>When she woke up from her noon nap, Kelly told her that the Easter bunny came and she asked “Did he hide the eggs?” How does she know that?</p>

<p>She found all the eggs and immediately opened each plastic one as she found them to get the Jelly Belly inside.</p>

          <p>We had an appointment in Seattle this afternoon so we asked Kelly to stay late and we made it into a date night. After our appointment, we went up to Wallingford to <a href="http://bottleworksbeerstore.blogspot.com/">BottleWorks</a> to stock up on some new beers and then to their beer restaurant in Fremont, <a href="http://www.brouwerscafe.com/bier.html">Brouwer’s Cafe</a>, for dinner.</p>

<p>Brouwer’s Cafe has been around for a while now but I didn’t even know about until about 6 months ago. It’s in a very cool space and has several fridges of bottled beers behind the bar and 60 taps of draft beer. It took 20 minutes after we got there, and 10 minutes after we ordered, to get our first beers and the place wasn’t even crowded – maybe 20 people in the place with 5 or 6 staffers. The wait staff are all tattooed death-metal types who don’t seem to like people (read: me when I was 17 without minus the tattoos). The food is “Belgian inspired” and not bad, but not great. I had the lamb burger which was surprisingly spicy, a little too spicy, and Gay had the Croque Monsieur.</p>

<p>In spite of their big draft beer selection, nothing really stuck out as need-to-try beers. I ended up with Stone’s Arrogant Bastard, which isn’t hard to find in bottles, but I’d never had it on tap. Gay got the local Maritime’s Dry-hopped IPA. My second beer was <a href="http://www.averybrewing.com/">Avery</a>’s Maharaja IPA, which is a wonderful Imperial IPA and one that I discovered recently in the bottle on our trip to Oregon. Avery is one of my new favorite breweries.</p>

<p>We didn’t want to get home at 7pm on our date night so we decided to stop at Beveridge Place Pub which is not far from the ferry. I had the delicious Rogue Old Crustacean barley wine (I’ve been into barley wines lately, a beer I’ve always disliked) and Gay had the Full Sail Imperial Porter. A quick stop at Starbucks for coffees and we were on our way to catch the 8:45 ferry.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>For Saturday evening I wanted to have a special beer so I looked into the beer/wine fridge for something new to try. I decided on the <a href="http://www.ommegang.com/index.php?mcat=1&amp;scat=6">Ommegang Ommegeddon</a> because Ommegang is a great beer-maker and even though it has brettanomyces in it, which I don’t like, if it can be used for a good beer Ommegang should be able to do it. And it’s dry-hopped, which I really like.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>Ommegang’s description:</p>

<blockquote>Ommegeddon is 8% ABV Belgian-style ale with a wild twist -- a dose of Brettanomyces yeast and a blast of dry hopping. It's a strong blonde ale with a sharp citrus flavor that, like the other Ommegang ales, has a dry finish. Its dryness and funkiness begat the name of Ommegeddon -- for the time when the forces of light and dark battle for world dominion. It's time for you to pick your side.</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, it’s bottle-conditioned and the bottle was on its side in the fridge so the yeast sediment had not settled at the bottom. So I put it in the regular fridge for Sunday instead.</p>

<p>It’s a very light-colored beer and I didn’t detect any hop aromas at all. I figured it was too cold and I’d let it warm up a little. But then it smelled like a musty basement. Blech. The taste was nothing special although it wasn’t as sour as I’d have expected with the brettanomyces.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3439099376/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3305/3439099376_a8f8b60bc6.jpg" alt="Ommegang Ommegeddon" /></a></p>

<p>I ended up not finishing the little bit I poured and decided to treat myself to something I knew I’d like: Dogfish Head’s Black &amp; Blue. I had this <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/06/01/dogfish-head-black-blue/">last year in June</a> and really liked it. But that day was hot and today was cold and rainy so I didn’t expect it to be as enjoyable. It didn’t beat my memory of the last one I had and it tasted more like a fruit-punch beer, but I liked it a lot.</p>

        <article>
          <p>For the first time in her life, Havana didn’t wear a diaper today. She wore “big girl underpants” as the next step in her potty-training. It wasn’t a successful step, she had a few mistakes and ended the day in a diaper. But she was very proud of herself!</p>

<p>She almost always uses the toilet for #2 and about half of her #1s. My guess is that in 6 months she won’t be wearing diapers anymore.</p>
