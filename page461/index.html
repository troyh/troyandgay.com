              <p>We left early Thanksgiving morning for Florida.  Car &gt; Ferry &gt; Shuttle &gt; Subway &gt; Airplane &gt; Monorail &gt; Car we arrived at Troy’s parents house 3,000 miles away 12 hours later. We had Thanksgiving dinner with Troy’s mom, dad, aunt Lorna, brother and sister-in-law on Friday. Saturday we took a driving tour of the area (deftly avoiding the mall), bought a digital camera and then experienced the best of Ocalla dining and entertainment.  “The Villages” is a fully manufactured Southwest style shopping center and square.  With free entertainment every night in the square and 2-for-1 drinks, who’s complaining?  That night we continued the party til 3a…  Sunday we just hung around the house and watched football.</p>

              <p>Last night, a little after 9pm, tokyo went bonkers. The cache updating combined with heavy traffic brought the SQL server to it’s knees. I couldn’t even get an ssh login! An hour later, I called Aaron at CoLo to reset the machine. After 11pm, he was there and reset it. But it didn’t work; the machine just refused to boot. By midnight, we came to the conclusion that we would have to go into Seattle and try to fix the machine ourselves. This is the day before our expected biggest day ever, btw.</p>

<p>By 1:15am, we packed our stuff up, burned CDs with a database backup and a MySQL installation. We took the 1:30am ferry into Seattle and headed to the Westin building. About 5 minutes before we arrived, my cell phone notified me that tokyo was OK! We got to the machine and found it was just fine (although the clock was off by an hour since the hardware clock is not as smart as the software clock wrt Daylight Savings Time).</p>

<p>We went back to the Fauntleroy dock and waited til 5:30am when the first ferry took us back to Vashon.</p>

<p>We need some backup/redundancy plan.</p>
