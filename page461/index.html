            <p>For working so hard on the site redesign we decided to take the day off.  Spend the afternoon in the city running errands and lunch at the Elysian.</p>

<p><strong>Updated by Troy:</strong> Went to Home Depot and bought a 20’ extension ladder (for gutter-cleaning), then to Costco for the usuals. Then to Petco and the CD store where we got the new <em>Richard Ashcroft</em> and the new <em>Badly Drawn Boy</em>. Then we came home, worked a little, had dinner and finished <em>Monsters Inc</em> on DVD. I also got a bike ride in this morning, which was fun and Vashon is very fall with the leaves turning (and all over the roads).</p>

<p>I’m pretty tired tonight, and a little put-off by the negative feedback about the new site design. We’ve had lots of positive feedback, but some complaints from some. Sometimes it gets hard to work so hard on something, make no money on it and have to listen to people telling us we suck. Did we ever say we’re perfect and never make a mistake? If not, why do people feel the need to slam us?</p>

Launched new site design tonight at 7:30.  A week’s worth of very very hard work is over.  So far they love it: <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=20526&amp;18">1</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=20525&amp;15">2</a>.</p>

            <p>A study on <a href="http://www.consumerwebwatch.org/news/report3_credibilityresearch/stanfordPTL_abstract.htm">How Consumers and Experts Rate Credibility on the Web</a>: <em>The data showed that the average consumer paid far more attention to the superficial aspects of a site, such as visual cues, than to its content.</em></p>

<p>Hopefully, our new design will make Recipezaar more  credible. :-)</p>

            <p>We just came to the realization that <a href="http://www.makersmark.com/">Maker’s Mark</a> is far more cost-effective than wine…. for $45, a 1.75 liter bottle of Maker’s Mark lasts a week or two, but a $45 bottle of wine only lasts one evening.</p>

<p><em>Note to self: invest in a winemaker.</em></p>
