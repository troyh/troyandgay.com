            <div class="post-content">
              <p>The Democratic Party debate last night on CNN was more of the same. Hillary sounded like she understood the issues, Obama sounded good. And I drank some good wine watching it.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer #1:</em> I am a fiscal conservative and a social liberal. That means that I agree with the Republicans on capitalism, the free market, taxes, etc. (to an extent), but I agree with the Democrats on civil rights, helping the less fortunate, etc. (to an extent).</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer #2:</em> I think Hillary Clinton is very pretty and intelligent and I’m attracted to smart pretty women. I’m not physically attracted to either Obama or McCain.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer #3:</em> I drank wine during the debate.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>In this debate, as usual, I feel good about the intentions of the Democratic nominees but cringe at their views on economics.</p>

<p>On healthcare, Obama and Clinton offer very similar plans – they both want to make healthcare affordable. Okay, I like affordable (whatever that means), but how do you pay for it? Cutting doctor’s salaries? No, I want my doctor to be educated, experienced and financially-incented to keep me healthy for a long time. My garbage man gets paid no matter how healthy I am and, consequently, he doesn’t seem to care at all about my health. The government has to subsidize it, but where do they get the money? They say ending the expensive war in Iraq plus getting rid of the Bush tax cuts will do it. That’ll work for the first few years, but not long-term. What else would the government not be paying for that it probably should be paying for?</p>

<p>On the economy, Obama said this:</p>

<p>bq. “Now, what I’ve said is that we have to restore a sense of fairness and balance to our economy, and that means a couple of things. Number one, with our tax code: We’ve got to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas and invest those tax breaks in companies that are investing here in the United States of America.”</p>

<p>This sounds like there are specific tax breaks for companies that fire Americans and hire people in foreign countries. Of course there’s no such thing. Rather than be clear, he seems to be trying to instill a sense of outrage in the American people that there are evil companies acting against Americans and the Bush administration is encouraging it. It sounds really good (for him, that is), but what he really means, I think, is that companies all get tax breaks and he wants to take them away from the ones that are outsourcing. And he doesn’t understand that outsourcing is actually good for the country and for the world. It’s bad for the specific people who lost their jobs, of course, but it’s good for everyone else in the world.</p>

<p>Hillary talked about investing in technologies to create more jobs and to improve the United States. She said:</p>

<p>bq. “We’ve got to get back to being the innovation nation. Think of everything that goes on at this great university to create the new economy…”</p>

<p>I agree, but let’s be clear, the US is still the innovation nation. I don’t mind tax dollars going to help fund even more investment in technology and innovation, but she shouldn’t make it sound like it’s not happening at all and we need the government to make it happen.</p>

<p>The topic of Obama plagiarizing came up and Hillary harped on it. When this allegation came up a few days ago I thought that some dummy in her campaign thought it was a good point and made too big a deal about it, but seeing her continue it made it clear that she agrees with it. It’s a stupid and weak argument, she needs to let it go. I couldn’t care less if the President plagiarizes, I’m not hiring a writer for President. I don’t mind if the President steals good ideas, it sure beats coming up with his own bad ideas like our current President tends to do.</p>

              <p>The big political news today is a New York Times story about McCain and a female lobbyist. McCain staffers from his 2000 campaign were concerned that “his relationship with a lobbyist looked suspicious”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/us/politics/21mccain.html. He and the lobbyist claim that they had no romantic relationship and that she didn’t influence him in his policies (this must be the first time a lobbyist has ever insisted that they are ineffective!).</p>

<p>History is a legitimate way to defend against accusations because with people (unlike stocks), past performance <em>is</em> an indicator of future performance. Of course, he and his supporters cite his history as a Senator to back his impartiality claims. However, they don’t cite his history as a husband to refute the romantic relationship. And for good reason, “he has had several extramarital affairs”:http://www.azcentral.com/news/specials/mccain/articles/0301mccainbio-chapter5.html.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Yesterday was the one year anniversary of the proposed merger between Sirius and XM Radio. Neither the DoJ or the FCC have ruled for or against the merger yet. Is one year a long time? Yes, it’s “the longest merger approval process ever”:http://www.orbitcast.com/archives/still-waiting-comparing-the-siriusxm-merger-to-others.html. The reason for this is that the “National Association of Broadcasters”:http://www.nab.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home, a lobbying group employed by terrestrial radio (satellite radio’s competitors), has “spent over $4 million convincing the federal government to block the merger”:http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/sep2007/db20070911_112892.htm?campaign_id=rss_daily. Sirius and XM have spent one-quarter of that to get the merger approved.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Arguing that this merger is bad for consumers is difficult. Preventing new companies from competing in the market for broadcasting is bad for consumers, regardless of whether it’s distributed over terrestrial airwaves, satellite, the internet or two tin cans and a string. If the two companies don’t merge, they’ll both go bankrupt. Granted, both should have done the math before spending bajillions launching satellites, but the antitrust laws aren’t intended to help kill stupid companies, they’re there to benefit consumers.</p>

<p>More reasons to approve the merger:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Well-known economist, and great author, “Steven Landsburg”:http://www.landsburg.com/about2.html wrote in “The Armchair Economist”:http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/isbn%3D0029177766/103-5861159-0190219, paraphrasing someone else I believe, that the best way to determine if a merger should be approved is if their competitors complain. If they complain, it’s bad for competitors (and good for competition) so approve the merger; if they don’t complain, it’s good for competitors (and bad for competition) so they should block the merger. Obviously, the NAB is complaining so approve the merger.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>John Ashcroft, dumbest Attorney General ever, “was hired as a lobbyist by the NAB after XM refused to hire him”:http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2007/03/02/ashcroft-blasts-sirius-xm-merger/. He wrote a letter to the second-dumbest Attorney General ever, Alberto Gonzales, encouraging him to block the merger. Dumb people like dumb ideas – it’s usually best to do what dumb people don’t do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have one car with Sirius and one with XM and I want to hear Howard Stern and NFL Radio in the car with XM and I want to hear XM’s less repetitive music channels in the car with Sirius. This is reason enough to approve it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>“Sign the online petition”:http://www.petitiononline.com/satmerge/petition.html to have the merger approved and read “Sirius’ merger site”:http://www.siriusmerger.com/site/newsroom.</p>

<p>“Fidel Castro has finally resigned”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/20/world/americas/20cuba.html?_r=1&amp;ex=1361163600&amp;en=85d5fade1aec1c47&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;oref=slogin as President of Cuba. The US is not ready to lift the embargo:</p>

<p>bq. In Washington, John D. Negroponte, deputy secretary of state, said it was unlikely that the United States would lift its trade embargo on Cuba, Reuters reported.</p>

<p>But “it’s inevitable”:http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120340790591776533.html?mod=rss_whats_news_us that Cuba is opened up to Americans again:</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>bq. Many analysts say that Raul Castro hopes to emulate the Chinese model of development, in which the Communist party maintains tight political control while experimenting with economic liberalization.</p>

<p>bq. In addition, a number of voices in Congress have called for easing relations, and those lawmakers are bound to get a broader hearing if a Democrat wins the White House. “We have had a bad policy for nearly 50 years for bad reasons that have nothing to do with Cuba,” says Democratic New York Rep. Charles Rangel, who heads the House Ways and Means Committee. “There will be a change,” agreed Republican Rep. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who has tried for years to lift a ban on travel by Americans to Cuba.</p>

<p>bq. In December 2006, Mr. Flake and Rep. William Delahunt (D., Mass.) led a 10-member delegation to Havana, the largest Congressional delegation to visit Cuba. Mr. Flake says he has “guarded optimism” about the possibilities of easing the decades-long embargo. Other lawmakers say they will try to attach amendments to farm and appropriations legislation to ease restrictions on travel, cash remittances and agricultural exports to the island.</p>

<p>bq. The European Union said it was ready to seek ways to relaunch ties with Cuba. “We reiterate our willingness to engage with Cuba in a constructive dialogue,” John Clancy, a spokesman for EU Aid Commissioner Louis Michel, told a regular news briefing, noting that Mr. Michel planned to visit the island on March 6-7.</p>

<p>bq. A number of U.S. businesses can be expected to pressure for an opening, including agricultural exporters, who have already sold $1.5 billion of chicken, corn and other foodstuffs to the island since the government permitted food sales to the island in 2001.While Cuba is a relatively small and mostly penniless market of some 11 million people, hotel, airline, tourism and oil companies, interested in drilling in Cuba’s coastal waters where some oil has already been found, can be expected to join in the campaign.</p>

<p>And when it is, we will bring Havana to her namesake city to show her the city she was named after and where we picked her name eight years before she was born. And I can get some cigars. Havana was a beautiful city but today looks like it’s been through a war with unpaved pothole-laden streets and crumbling buildings. I’m optimistic.</p>
