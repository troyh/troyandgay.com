          </h3>
            <p>I had to go for my checkup with the opthamologist after <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/02/18/metal-in-my-eye/">he fixed my eye</a> – it’s healing perfectly – and Gay had a haircut appointment, so we went into Seattle this morning. We went to the house and talked to Mark about some things. Katie happened to stop by and we talked to her about some things. Then Tom, the tile guy, came over and we talked about the problem tile in the master bath. More on that later…</p>

<p>The garage was finished being framed last week and they put the floor down. A few weeks ago, I bought the hardware for the door (hinges and lifts) and I wanted to help build the trapdoor. I didn’t get a chance to build the actual door, but they waited for me to get there and put the hardware on. Colin showed me how to use a hand router and made the guide for one handle. I finished routing that one out, this time with my new safety glasses!, and then marked and routed out the space for the other handle.</p>

<p>The plywood on the door is 3/4” plywood and the handle recess is 11/16”, so there was just 1/16” of plywood covering the bottom of the handle. It took a while to rout out the handle recess rather than just use a jigsaw to cut the hole out completely, so I asked Colin why we didn’t just cut it out. He looked at me and said “But you’d see it from below.”  I like his attention to detail and concern with aesthetics!</p>

<p>He marked the hinges and I routed out the space for those. We mounted them and the door was almost done. Colin took a planer to the one side of the door so that it could open without rubbing against the opening. We then screwed down the other side of the hinges into the floor and we had a working trapdoor!</p>

<p>When I opened it for the first time I realized a problem I didn’t anticipate: it’s such a big door that when you lift it your momentum pulls you forward and towards the hole in the floor. It’s about 12 feet down to the garage floor, so it’s not a comfortable feeling. Worse, I instantly had the thought of the kids playing with it and falling through. We will need to put a lock on it and maybe find a way to make it open by itself once it’s started. There will usually be a car below it, so your fall would be broken by the car after falling just a few feet, but Murphy’s Law says that the time you do fall, the car won’t be there.</p>

<p>Before we left, I quickly sanded off some of the paint on the beam and rafter structure above the front door to see what was underneath. Aside from colors and the decks outside, we’ve ignored the exterior of the house. I always imagined those things as big rustic wood beams, but we never knew what they were made of. I assumed it’d be cheap wood and we’d either have to just paint them or do something to make them look better. I was happy to discover that they are made of, according to Colin, <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=vg+fir&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1ZNmTcjeKoLSsAO4l-ymBA&amp;ved=0CEAQsAQ&amp;biw=1199&amp;bih=1449">vertical-grain Douglas Fir</a>! I think we can sand off the paint and put a clear coat on them and they’ll look great. I may even get to do this myself as I’m running out of things I am qualified to do at the house.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>In trying to compare server hosting companies, I tried to get an account at ServerBeach. I filled in my name, address, credit card info, etc. and submitted it. I was told it takes 24 hours to provision a server.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>That’s not surprising because they may have to go physically set up a machine and then install an OS on the machine, which takes a human, so I waited. The next day they called and, because <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/02/18/metal-in-my-eye/">I was unavailable</a>, they left a voice mail asking me to call them to confirm my credit card info. I called back the next day and the customer support person, a “Beach Buddy”, was unavailable so I left him voice mail. I didn’t hear anything for another 48 hours when I got this email:</p>

<blockquote>Hello Troy,

I apologize but since I have not heard back from you, I have denied the order and have ceased the provisioning process. If you would still like to do business with us please call 1-888-840-9091 and speak to one of our Business Development Consultants.  Thank you for your time and considering ServerBeach.

<p>WTF? He did hear from me, I left voice mail. I replied telling him that I did return his call 2 days ago:</p>

<blockquote>I returned your call on Saturday and left a voice mail, waited patiently and I never heard back. Now you just go cancel the order.</blockquote>

<p>He replied, telling me that he didn’t even listen to his voice mail before deciding I hadn’t called him back:</p>

<blockquote>Hello Troy,

I apologize, I have not been in the office today to listen to my messages.  If you do not mind, please email me a photo of your ID and Credit Card used to place the order.  We request this of you as a precaution against identity theft.  It is for your protection as well as my company's.  Thank you for your time and for your understanding.

<p>This company makes it difficult to become a customer under the guise of protecting them. It’s not true, it only protects them, not me. Credit card thieves buy real goods, they don’t steal credit cards so they can host a web site. ServerBeach does this so they don’t waste time setting up a server they may not get paid for, not to keep my identity safe. They should do it, but they should do it quickly and they shouldn’t pretend they’re doing it for anyone but themselves.</p>

<p>I tried to explain all of this to another customer support person, but he couldn’t understand what went wrong, insisting that it was because I refused to call them and provide them with the info they need. The original customer support emailed me again with the reason this problem occurred:</p>

<blockquote>I did explain that I was not in the office today and in my haste on Friday I apologize for not posting our office hours in my correspondence with you.  Something I am rectifying in my signature now for future correspondences with any client.
</blockquote>

<p>He thinks the problem was that I didn’t know his office hours, not that he didn’t check his voice mail. In other words, it’s my fault, not his.</p>

<p>If ServerBeach is this bad at handling new customers and the sales part of the business, I can’t imagine they’re very good at solving hardware and software problems for existing customers.</p>

<p>FWIW, of all the hosting companies I signed up for, only one, Rackspace, required such a double-check. But Rackspace called within 5 minutes and my account was ready to go 15 minutes after requesting it. ServerBeach waited 24 hours and then another 48 hours.</p>

<p>Eva is 2 months old today. She’s still a great baby, I can’t imagine how a baby could be easier. She only cries when she is hungry and, unless it’s taking too long, her cries are quiet. Like Hudson, she goes to sleep easily – no 45-minute struggle like Havana was. And she’s almost sleeping through the night already, often only woken up by Havana who still doesn’t always sleep through the night.</p>

            <p>While <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/02/18/two-breweries/">Gay, Eva and I went into Seattle</a>, Kelly and her nanny friend also went into Seattle to take the kids to the <a href="http://www.pacsci.org/">Pacific Science Center</a> to see dinosaurs, butterflies (“papillons”, as Havana says), etc. Hudson <em>loves</em> dinosaurs.</p>

            <p>After the <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/02/18/metal-in-my-eye/">unscheduled visit to the doctor</a>, we swung by the house to check on progress. The drywall was going up in the attic. The guest room was done and we could see some of the cross-ties through the drywall. It’s going to look great when the ceiling is all drywalled.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5457452594/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5019/5457452594_b50c1c4213.jpg" alt="IMG_3056" /></a></p>

<p>Kelly and another nanny friend took Havana and Hudson and her kids to the Pacific Science Center so we had no reason to go home. We decided to stay in Seattle for the day, so we went  down to Georgetown to see the <a href="http://www.georgetownbeer.com/">Georgetown Brewery</a>, something we’ve been meaning to do for a while because our favorite architect, Tom Kundig, did their tasting room and its outside:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5457454430/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5253/5457454430_5ca28e10b2.jpg" alt="IMG_3058" /></a></p>

<p>They don’t sell beer except in kegs or growlers at the brewery, but they give out free samples. As Homer Simpson would say, free beer? That’s unpossible! We had a couple samples while we looked at the details of the place. We think we’re going to design our basement bar similar to what Tom did for the counter at the brewery. And our offices will be split by a moving steel wall like what they have on the outside, although not that big or rusty.</p>

<p>The Georgetown Brewery is decorated with photos of local places and I noticed that one was a photo of the Seattle Brewing and Malting Company building. I didn’t realize it was still standing. That was the brewery that the guy who built our house founded and where the famous Rainier Beer was created. After lunch at <a href="http://www.stellarpizza.com/">Stellar Pizza</a> down the street, we went down the street a little further and found the old building:</p>

<p>I love having a house that is part of Seattle (beer) history.</p>
