            <p>I’ve spent days trying to get our troyandgay.com server setup. I want it to be an <a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a> web server that supports <a href="http://www.webdav.org">WebDAV</a>. I originally tried to use Apache 1.3.27 but couldn’t get <a href="http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav/">mod_dav</a> to work – it worked but every GET generated a 504 error (permissions error).</p>

<p>After sitting in bed working on my iBook til 3:30am one night, I gave up and tried Apache 2.0.44. WebDAV is built-in to Apache 2 and it worked right out of the box (so to speak). But nothing else worked… PHP only works as a module, not compiled in and it was flakey, CGI scripts were also flakey, and the server refused to send any images greater than 256 bytes – it gave a 200 result code in the access_log, but no browser got any data.</p>

<p>So I went back to Apache 1.3.27 and everything works just fine, except for WebDAV. Oh well. I’ll save WebDAV for another day. But, boy, would WebDAV be nice. Mac OS X works perfectly with it and even Windows supports it (in its usual klunky way). But at least troyandgay.com will be running PHP 4.3 and MySQL 4.0! That’s probably enough cutting-edge stuff for now.</p>

            <p>Just ordered two new <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/262/wo/EF8AOrHt15b92Ne6DeB1Fwls0WW/1.3.0.3.27.21.1.1.19.3.1.1.0?45,14">PowerMacs</a> and the <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/262/wo/EF8AOrHt15b92Ne6DeB1Fwls0WW/3.3.0.3.27.8">20” display</a> from <a href="http://macmall.com">MacMall</a>. They also gave us 2 free 512MB RAM chips and 2 (crappy, I’m sure) printers that are both free after rebates. I had to up the shipping from ground to 2-day since they ship from Memphis. Then they called me a few minutes later and told me I can save $55 if I ship it 3-day instead of 2-day. So I did that instead. Hopefully, they’ll be here by Thursday, but because Monday is a holiday, maybe Friday. </p>

<p>This turned out to be better than driving to Portland to avoid sales tax because MacMall doesn’t charge sales tax on WA orders and they gave the free RAM. I called <a href="http://thecomputerstore.com">The Computer Store</a> in Portland and asked if they’d also give me free RAM to match it. They refused claiming that they give “instant gratification” and “free shipping”. They just lost out on $5000+ worth of sales.</p>

            <p>We’re still not totally sure what to make of <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/000802.shtml#000802">the purchase</a>: protecting PageRank, getting annotations to work finally, instant Intranet for the Search Appliance…  Regardless of the reasons, methinks it is good news for all weblogs.</p>
