          <p>The Super Bowl is today. Adam Blum, of all people, is coming over with this 2 kids. I haven’t seen him in 5 years or so. Biff may come over. Gary Sipple is coming over too (Nancy is out of town in Oregon).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Game was boring, Tampa Bay blew the Raiders out. Adam and his daughter, Liz, came out and Gary came over. Biff opted out as Renuka had to write a paper or something. We had beers, wine, chips, a great 7-layer dip, wings and ribs for dinner.</p>

<p>Gary showed me how to chop wood so I can finish the tree in the backyard! Adam &amp; Liz had to go after the game but Gary stayed and had ribs with us.</p>

          <p>Dedicatednet’s customers running Microsot SQL server suffered a denial of service attack from 9:30-11:30p last night, and by extension Recipezaar suffered an outage too.  Couldn’t be luckier about the timing – so late on a friday night – but scary nonetheless when we couldn’t even figure out what was going on.  Blame .</p>

          <p>Wow, <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/030122/rosen_resignation_4.html">Hilary Rosen resigned from the RIAA</a>. We know she was frustrated with the idiots at the head of the big 5 record companies who fought electronic distribution of music, but could this be the beginning of the turnaround for the RIAA? Don’t fight progress, you’ll always lose.</p>
