            <p><img src="http://www.michaeljackson.com/images/cvr-silver.jpg" alt="" />Micheal Jackson might be a little strange, but his plastic surgery is his own damn business – he has to live with that nose – and I really don’t believe he  did anything more than sleep in the same bed as those kids.  While he may not the best father (kid out the window), he hires nurses for that job.  He is certainly a great friend of children; mainly because he has not grown up himself.  This documentary guy was out to <a href="http://www.steveharvey.com/michaeljackson.htm">manipulate Jackson just like the father of the kid he settled the sexual abuse case</a>.  Poor Michael.</p>

            <p>Another mention of Recipezaar in a newspaper! The <a href="http://www.sptimes.com">St. Petersburg Times</a> <a href="http://www.sptimes.com/2003/02/19/Taste/Dish.shtml">mentions Recipezaar</a>: <em>Faced with nearly 50,000 recipes (an embarrassment of riches), your biggest problem will be picking one from this voluminous site. Recipes are conveniently categorized and easily sorted, and this will help. If time is of the essence, you can choose by preparation time (0 to 15 minutes, 15 to 30 minutes or 30 to 60 minutes). If economy is important, you can choose among 7,818 recipes that use five or fewer ingredients. People on special diets will find this site fertile ground, with options for diets of every ilk.</em></p>

            <p>Surprise! The Macs <a href="/archives/2003/02/001221.php#001221">we ordered</a> FedEx 3-day got here in 1 day! We were even planning to run errands in Seattle today so we would’ve missed the FedEx man; but luckily, we postponed that until Wednesday. Anyway, I’ve put pics up at <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/troyh3/">my (temporary) .mac site</a>. The Quicksilver PowerMacs look even better than I remember them. They’re <em>very</em> silver…. I thought our old PowerMac was silver but it’s more bluish. And these things are <em>fast</em>!!
