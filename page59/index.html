              <p>Havana and Eva had doctor’s appointments so we went to the house so I could do some work while they went to the doctor in the afternoon. The day started bad with traffic on the West Seattle Bridge, I-99 and I-5 so we drove south to avoid it, Eva started crying and we took the long route to the house. Once we got to the house, the work I had to do did not go well. Because we moved the ladder rack from the position we were originally going to install it, all the wires were on the wrong side of a radiator pipe bracket. We couldn’t temporarily move the bracket, so I had to pull all the wires out, re-route them around the bracket and then put them back. Simple idea, but it turned into a mess. The wires all became tangled because there wasn’t enough room to spread them out. Me, Mark and later, a Schuchart/Dow intern spent a couple hours straightening them all out. That’s about all I got done all day, so it was frustrating.</p>

<p>While I kept working, Gay took the kids out to a park and then picked up dinner for us. We sat on the floor upstairs eating our dinner, while I complained about the work I still had to do. We didn’t get home until 10:30p and were going back in the next day, hoping for a better day.</p>

              <p>Before Eva was born, they saw a cyst on her ovary during an ultrasound. Because we didn’t want to know the gender, they were careful not to explain anything in too much detail (and not say “ovary”!) but told us that it’s probably nothing to worry about and the OB/GYN kept reassuring us. Hard not to worry, though, especially when you have to not do any research about it for fear of discovering the gender.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>If she were a boy, a cyst would almost certainly mean cancer, but for girls they are <em>not uncommon</em> (which sounds like it’s common, but is really a doctor’s way of saying “it’s rare, but not so rare that we don’t know what to do”), since the job of an ovary is to create cysts every month to release an egg. They usually go away by themselves once the mother’s hormones are not coursing through the baby. Even the surgery, if necessary, is a simple operation they said. Even simple operations are scary to a parent and hard to think about doing to an infant.</p>

<p>We brought her to <a href="http://www.seattlechildrens.org/">Seattle Children’s Hospital</a> for a couple ultrasounds since she was born and we met with their resident expert on this, but it wasn’t shrinking. So they said to wait a little longer but will probably need surgery in a few months. And she had definitely lost one ovary, unfortunately.</p>

<p>But today, she had another ultrasound and it is now shrinking and will not need surgery after all! Good job, Eva!</p>

              <p>Eva is now 6 months old. She’s eating solid foods almost completely now, sleeps really well usually, has a great temperament, can pick up her binky and put it in her mouth on her own. We celebrated her half-birthday with a cake after dinner.</p>

<p>Mark and Lee, who are in Seattle visiting from London, came over for dinner and celebrated with us. They brought Eva a cute onesie, Hudson a polo shirt and Havana a counting game involving London buses. Hudson wanted to put his shirt on right away and Mark and Lee played the game with her and Hudson while we had cocktails.</p>

              <p>My first Father’s Day with Eva. Gay and the kids made me breakfast in bed, but I was already up and dressed by the time they got to the room. They made me a Bloody Mary with the <a href="http://www.bakonvodka.com/">Bakon Vodka</a> that is so disgusting on its own that it can only be put in a Bloody Mary. I got an electric razor and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Go-F-Sleep-Adam-Mansbach/dp/1617750255">a book</a> to read to Eva, but it’s a book that should be read to all of the kids.</p>
