          <p>We met <a href="http://scoteckley.com/pages/home.php">Scot Eckley</a>, the landscape designer we hired, to go over the designs he’s been working on. He came with three designs, which is what we like to see. Multiple unique designs gives us the chance to see different ways of doing the same thing, to pick and choose the best of each and to merge them together. It’s also much quicker. We didn’t ask for 3 designs, he just showed up with 3.</p>

<p>We had a our monthly project review meeting with Schuchart/Dow and they got to see the landscape designs too and give us some feedback from their point-of-view.</p>

<p>I’m not a fan of designers, in general, given our experiences with them in our careers. A good designer can do two things: 1) be creative and 2) understand how people use what they’re designing. Very few people who call themselves designers can do even one of those, and almost none of them can do both. This is why we love Tom Kundig so much, he excels at both (moreover, he’s efficient). Scot did a great job, he had 3 very unique designs and all had clever ideas in them like a hidden sandbox, an outdoor chalkboard and a swing attachment for the kids. We couldn’t have been happier with what he showed us and how sharp he is as a designer.</p>

<p>We took the designs home and later in the evening we went through them again and, to my surprise, we came up with what we think is the best design: it’s a merging of 2 of them with some slight changes. The 3rd design was practically dismissed altogether, but it helped us figure out what we didn’t want, so even it was useful. We’re very excited to get that started. And just in time too, the decks will change a bit and Schuchart/Dow is getting ready to start framing the decks.</p>

<p>Gay likes to remind me that Scot is the reason we even have this house in Seattle. We originally had him over to our Vashon house two years ago to talk about landscaping the yard. He had good ideas that led us to consider making changes to the house. That snowballed into changing more things in the house and ultimately deciding to change the entire thing and <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2009/06/29/our-architect/">build a whole new house</a>! For other reasons, we eventually decided to just move and, a year later, we bought the house in Seattle. Now Scot’s designing our yard, but an entirely different one than we originally talked to him about doing.</p>

          <p>We went into Seattle three times this week, Monday, Wednesday and Friday. While Gay ran errands, I worked on putting in flooring in the garage at the house.</p>

<p>Today, Gay met with Nancy and My at NB Design’s office to go over furniture, fabrics and paint colors. I was supposed to go, but I get bored quickly talking about that stuff and I wanted to stay at the house and continue working.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5497726102/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5177/5497726102_971986e9d7.jpg" alt="NB Design's proposed colors and fabrics: Lounge" /></a></p>

<p>I was debriefed on it later and Gay brought home all the furniture configurations for me to see. In addition to their preferred furniture picks, they provided us with a thick binder of alternative furniture pieces, organized by room. It’s tough for them to pick furniture for the house because we want two styles, a more traditional style but edging towards modern for the main floors and a more modern/rustic/casual style for the basement and attic. They are mostly a modern interior design firm, so they’re going against their grain a little with the traditional styles and, frankly, we’re not much help because we don’t know exactly what we want either. They did great with the lounge, though, which is in the traditional part. I’d say about half of the rest of the house we like, the other half needs some more work.</p>

<p>The hardest part is picking wall sconces and chandeliers. I just don’t like much of anything I see. They picked a great chandelier by <a href="http://www.alisonbergerglassworks.com/">Alison Berger</a>, who I’d never heard of, for the dining room that I thought was great and I was happy until I found out how much it cost. We also have to pick a chandelier for foyer and the living room and I don’t know how we’re going to do those either.</p>

          <p>I had to go for my checkup with the opthamologist after <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/02/18/metal-in-my-eye/">he fixed my eye</a> – it’s healing perfectly – and Gay had a haircut appointment, so we went into Seattle this morning. We went to the house and talked to Mark about some things. Katie happened to stop by and we talked to her about some things. Then Tom, the tile guy, came over and we talked about the problem tile in the master bath. More on that later…</p>

<p>The garage was finished being framed last week and they put the floor down. A few weeks ago, I bought the hardware for the door (hinges and lifts) and I wanted to help build the trapdoor. I didn’t get a chance to build the actual door, but they waited for me to get there and put the hardware on. Colin showed me how to use a hand router and made the guide for one handle. I finished routing that one out, this time with my new safety glasses!, and then marked and routed out the space for the other handle.</p>

<p>The plywood on the door is 3/4” plywood and the handle recess is 11/16”, so there was just 1/16” of plywood covering the bottom of the handle. It took a while to rout out the handle recess rather than just use a jigsaw to cut the hole out completely, so I asked Colin why we didn’t just cut it out. He looked at me and said “But you’d see it from below.”  I like his attention to detail and concern with aesthetics!</p>

<p>He marked the hinges and I routed out the space for those. We mounted them and the door was almost done. Colin took a planer to the one side of the door so that it could open without rubbing against the opening. We then screwed down the other side of the hinges into the floor and we had a working trapdoor!</p>

<p>When I opened it for the first time I realized a problem I didn’t anticipate: it’s such a big door that when you lift it your momentum pulls you forward and towards the hole in the floor. It’s about 12 feet down to the garage floor, so it’s not a comfortable feeling. Worse, I instantly had the thought of the kids playing with it and falling through. We will need to put a lock on it and maybe find a way to make it open by itself once it’s started. There will usually be a car below it, so your fall would be broken by the car after falling just a few feet, but Murphy’s Law says that the time you do fall, the car won’t be there.</p>

<p>Before we left, I quickly sanded off some of the paint on the beam and rafter structure above the front door to see what was underneath. Aside from colors and the decks outside, we’ve ignored the exterior of the house. I always imagined those things as big rustic wood beams, but we never knew what they were made of. I assumed it’d be cheap wood and we’d either have to just paint them or do something to make them look better. I was happy to discover that they are made of, according to Colin, <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=vg+fir&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1ZNmTcjeKoLSsAO4l-ymBA&amp;ved=0CEAQsAQ&amp;biw=1199&amp;bih=1449">vertical-grain Douglas Fir</a>! I think we can sand off the paint and put a clear coat on them and they’ll look great. I may even get to do this myself as I’m running out of things I am qualified to do at the house.</p>

          <p>In trying to compare server hosting companies, I tried to get an account at ServerBeach. I filled in my name, address, credit card info, etc. and submitted it. I was told it takes 24 hours to provision a server.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>That’s not surprising because they may have to go physically set up a machine and then install an OS on the machine, which takes a human, so I waited. The next day they called and, because <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/02/18/metal-in-my-eye/">I was unavailable</a>, they left a voice mail asking me to call them to confirm my credit card info. I called back the next day and the customer support person, a “Beach Buddy”, was unavailable so I left him voice mail. I didn’t hear anything for another 48 hours when I got this email:</p>

<blockquote>Hello Troy,

I apologize but since I have not heard back from you, I have denied the order and have ceased the provisioning process. If you would still like to do business with us please call 1-888-840-9091 and speak to one of our Business Development Consultants.  Thank you for your time and considering ServerBeach.

<p>WTF? He did hear from me, I left voice mail. I replied telling him that I did return his call 2 days ago:</p>

<blockquote>I returned your call on Saturday and left a voice mail, waited patiently and I never heard back. Now you just go cancel the order.</blockquote>

<p>He replied, telling me that he didn’t even listen to his voice mail before deciding I hadn’t called him back:</p>

<blockquote>Hello Troy,

I apologize, I have not been in the office today to listen to my messages.  If you do not mind, please email me a photo of your ID and Credit Card used to place the order.  We request this of you as a precaution against identity theft.  It is for your protection as well as my company's.  Thank you for your time and for your understanding.

<p>This company makes it difficult to become a customer under the guise of protecting them. It’s not true, it only protects them, not me. Credit card thieves buy real goods, they don’t steal credit cards so they can host a web site. ServerBeach does this so they don’t waste time setting up a server they may not get paid for, not to keep my identity safe. They should do it, but they should do it quickly and they shouldn’t pretend they’re doing it for anyone but themselves.</p>

<p>I tried to explain all of this to another customer support person, but he couldn’t understand what went wrong, insisting that it was because I refused to call them and provide them with the info they need. The original customer support emailed me again with the reason this problem occurred:</p>

<blockquote>I did explain that I was not in the office today and in my haste on Friday I apologize for not posting our office hours in my correspondence with you.  Something I am rectifying in my signature now for future correspondences with any client.
</blockquote>

<p>He thinks the problem was that I didn’t know his office hours, not that he didn’t check his voice mail. In other words, it’s my fault, not his.</p>

<p>If ServerBeach is this bad at handling new customers and the sales part of the business, I can’t imagine they’re very good at solving hardware and software problems for existing customers.</p>

<p>FWIW, of all the hosting companies I signed up for, only one, Rackspace, required such a double-check. But Rackspace called within 5 minutes and my account was ready to go 15 minutes after requesting it. ServerBeach waited 24 hours and then another 48 hours.</p>
