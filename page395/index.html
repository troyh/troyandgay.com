Wow, the US may not have the world’s ugliest currency for long. Why the US is spending so much money to keep ahead of counterfeiters is beyond me, though. We should be moving to e-cash. I already have, I rarely have cash in my wallet. Does the US <em>still</em> prefer cash??</p>

          <p>Spent a few hours on Sunday cleaning the decks and weeding the back yard as Troy mowed.  I don’t know what it is about the soil out here, but the dandelions are HUGE.  Flower/seed stems are at least a foot tall and the plants (not weeds, full-on plants) are more than a foot in diameter.  Satisfying to kill.</p>

          <p>Maybe <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/30621.html">this</a> is the reason Google bought Blogger. Separating weblog content from their main index is good, I think, but how will Google know which sites are weblogs and which aren’t?</p>

          <p>On Friday, the Benders and another Vashon friend, Carol Eggen, came over for dinner (barbequed hamburgers).</p>

<p>On Saturday, we skipped our plans to go the <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/bellevuesquare/">new Apple Store</a>, the first in Seattle. Instead, we worked most of the day, as usual. :(  But we at least took advantage of the great weather and spent a good amount of time outdoors playing with the dogs and just relaxing.</p>

<p>I’m going to make a serious effort to get my weekends back. :)</p>
