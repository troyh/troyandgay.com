<p>Another Tour de France is over. It’s been a fun one to watch with excitement even on the usually boring flat stages. And I doubt I’ll ever hear Phil and Paul argue again like they did over the Contador/Schleck chain controversy.</p>

<p>I’ve been watching the Tour for 15 or 16 years now and for the first time that I’ve seen, the winner of the Tour de France is not someone I can say was the strongest in the race. One of the two strongest, but not clearly the strongest.

<p>Contador won by 39 seconds over Andy Schleck, the exact amount of time he gained on him when <a href="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/screen-shot-2010-07-25-at-11-25-04-am1.png2010/07/19/tdf-contador-controversy/">Schleck had a mechanical problem</a> and Contador rode away from him (first claiming he didn’t know then apologizing, saying he shouldn’t have done it). But the sport is also about the bike, equipment teammates, the coach, the mechanics, etc., and Contador didn’t have a mechanical problem at the wrong time, so he wins fair and square. Contador also won the Tour without winning a single stage, which is also a first for me to see. It’s generally considered bad form to win without at least one stage win.</p>

<p>Next year should be Schleck’s year.</p>

<p>Lance Armstrong’s team, Radio Shack, won the team competition. Lance is retiring, but I’ve heard that before.</p>

          <p>We slept well and woke up at 6:30a. We got dressed and went to Top Pot for coffee and doughnuts. We took a dozen doughnuts and a box of coffee back to the house for everyone who was coming over this morning.</p>

<p>Jim Dow was the first to show up. He brought his adorable new puppy, Blue, and his other dog, Beau, both Alaskan Malamutes, over too. His crew showed up a few minutes later. Tom arrived, then Dan (by bike!) got there and we took Tom through the house showing him our plans while the Schuchart/Dow guys started putting down protection on the floors and walls to prepare for the selective demolition.</p>

<p>Tom showed us again why he’s so good at what he does. We think we’re pretty good at understanding how we live, what we like and our daily routines. And we’re pretty good about thinking things through and organizing things for usability and efficiency. We’d been thinking about the house for weeks and drawing various plans for each room. Tom, after just minutes, in almost every room had better ideas. It was just like it was working with him on the Vashon house design. Other architects we worked with took days to formulate concrete ideas, Tom could listen to us and immediately start sketching out a couple ideas.</p>

<p>For example, there’s a powder room on the main floor that will be used often. Unfortunately, it is down a couple steps from the main floor. It was a little annoying that you have to step down a couple steps and the orientation of the bathroom was odd. We had no good ideas for it without doing major structural work around it. Jim pointed this problem out to Tom and within a minute Tom had an idea for raising the powder room to avoid the steps and to have a better orientation with more space. Just like that, he solved a problem that we were prepared to live with. It’s fun to work with someone like that.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s because of the housing crisis that architects don’t have a lot of work to do, but Tom builds houses all over the world and even now is in super-high demand so he can pick and choose the work he wants to do. Yet he’s willing and, frankly, excited to do <em>a remodel</em> (which is usually the dregs of work for architects) for us. He’s a guy who loves his job. Granted, he’s at the level where he describes things and lower-level people do the actual drawings and work out the details so he can work on lots of projects at once, but I’m still surprised we can even get him for this project.</p>

<p>We got the results of the hazardous materials tests and, shockingly, learned that there is no lead in any paint samples they took. I don’t understand how that could be. I thought it was practically guaranteed that you’d have lead in paint manufactured in the 1970s and earlier. Maybe they only painted later??? This is good because it’s expensive (10-15% more) to remove it because it requires special care and must follow strict disposal guidelines. The tile flooring is a different matter and the kitchen flooring is practically lethal, but all that is coming out anyway, so that’s not a big deal either.</p>

<p>They did a little demolition to figure out which direction the floor joists run to tell us which walls are load-bearing and require structural work to change. So far, our guesses were correct so the work we want to do is going to be straightforward so far. Other good news is that the 2-foot drop ceiling they installed in the kitchen was not done to cover up some horrible secret in the ceiling above. Who wants 10-foot ceilings when you can have 8-foot ceilings? Me! The original architect must have been pretty smart because it seems that all the spans were designed to require few load-bearing walls in the middle of the house. This makes it much easier to move walls. There is one wall in the kid’s bathroom we were sure was load-bearing and it made it hard to work around, but it doesn’t appear that it is.</p>

<p>Everything else is turning out better than expected too. Time and time again, we’re finding that the previous owners took better care of the house than we thought. The dubious choices in remodels over the years are not an indication of a tendency for poor maintenance, I guess. That makes us feel better because we paid a bit more for the house than we would have liked based on our assumptions that it required much more repair work.</p>

<p>We’re sure to find some crazy stuff in the plumbing and electrical just based on how old the house is, but so far, so good.</p>

<p>A cute Havana story: with all the people coming in over the day we repeatedly  introduced ourselves and also introduced Havana and Hudson. Havana followed me and one guy around as we walked and talked and she kept trying to get my attention.  I kept asking her what she wanted but she kept talking too quietly for me to understand her because she didn’t want him to hear, so I was also continuing the conversation with the guy. After the 4th or 5th time I figured out what she was saying.  She was saying “Daddy, tell him my name.” I had forgotten to introduce her.</p>

          <p>We made it onto the 9:40a ferry to Seattle and, thanks to the lane closure on the West Seattle bridge, didn’t get to the house until just before 11a. Havana and Hudson immediately ran through the entire house pointing out every room they found as if we’d never seen it before. They were pretty excited.</p>

<p>There were sunflowers and a very nice hand-made (with a photo she took in India, apparently) card were in the house from one of the family members who grew up in the house welcoming us:</p>

<p>Nancy, My and Laura came over for another walk-through now that we have plans closer to what we will do. We are having other contractors give us estimates too so there was about 20 people walking through the house.</p>

<p>We set up camp in the master bedroom and the kids took an afternoon nap. We met some more neighbors that stopped by to introduce themselves. Then we went to the grocery store and picked up some champagne, beer and other stuff to celebrate. Megan, Jon, Eric, Steve, Steve, Renuka, Owen and Claire all came over around 6 and we popped open the champagne and beer and ordered pizzas from Mad Pizza. Pizza delivery is one of the things I have been looking forward to the most being back in the city – there’s no such thing as that on Vashon (technically, just recently there has been, but not from the good pizza place).</p>

<p>While standing outside, a guy came over and asked us if we were the new owners. He is friends with the a grand-daughter (great grand-daughter?) of <a href="http://brewerygems.com/andrew.htm">Andrew Hemrich</a>, the beer baron, father of Rainier Beer, who built the house in 1909. She lives nearby and has never been inside the house. Hopefully, we’ll get the chance to show it to her before the renovation begins.</p>

<p>One of our new neighbors is a guy we worked with in Outlook at Microsoft and his wife and 2 kids – he was even one of the people who interviewed me for a job while I was visiting in 1996, so he’s partly responsible for me living here in the first place, meeting Gay, etc. He and his wife saw us in the yard and welcomed us to the neighborhood. Small world.</p>

<p>Everyone left by 10p, the kids were in bed and Gay and I sat on the front porch for an hour. The temperature was mid-60s but I was wearing shorts and a short-sleeve shirt. At our place on Vashon, without protection from the breeze off the water, we can’t stay out past 8pm without a fleece and long pants on! It’s going to be fun living in the city again. We spent our 30s in the country and will spend our 40s in the city – not the typical migration path.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Contador took the race lead today after attacking race-leader Andy Schleck after he had a mechanical problem. I’m no fan of crybaby Contador and I hate to see him win the Tour that way, but it’s part of the sport.</p>

<p>When interviewed about it, he shouldn’t have lied and said he didn’t know he had a problem – the guy was standing still when he rode around him. How could he have not known?!? At least he was booed when he took the podium to put on the yellow jersey. I’ve never seen/heard that before.</p>

<p>Maybe Contador will have a mechanical and lose the race this week. He’ll whine that it’s unfair when it happens to him, I’m sure. That’d be fun to see.</p>

<p>Cervelo team owner Gerard Vroomen <a href="http://velonews.competitor.com/2010/07/news/lance-armstrong-other-tour-riders-react-to-port-de-bales-chain-debate_129995">got it right</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Contador just gained a great chance to win, but he lost the chance to win greatly.</blockquote>

          <p>Kelly told us this morning that she just heard that a friend of hers was killed in Afghanistan this weekend. We realized she was talking about Robert Bennedsen, the model in “this blog post”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2005/07/01/3099/, and the son of our friends Scott and Tracy. Tracy did flowers for our wedding and Scott cooked the pig for the wedding feast.</p>

<p>He was just 25 years old. We only met him a couple times at their July 4th parties. He was a good smart kid and had far too short a life.</p>

<p>Our condolences to Scott &amp; Tracy.</p>
