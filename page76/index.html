              <p>She was born today at 2:47pm, 7 lbs 14 ounces, 19 inches. The labor was smooth and uneventful, a little quicker than Havana and a little slower than Hudson. She and Gay are doing well.</p>

<p>P.S. Her first name is pronounced like Eva Peron and Eva Gabor, not like Eva Longoria. :-)

              <p>Our neighbor, who is not neighborly, came to our house this morning with another unfriendly neighbor with shovels in their hands. They live down by the water about 200-300 feet below us. They told us that there was a mudslide that affected the road that runs down to their houses. They said they brought shovels to “redirect the stream of water running off our property” that caused the mudslide.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5265337034/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5201/5265337034_61c6bdb638.jpg" alt="Mudslide" /></a></p>

<p>What they didn’t realize is that Seattle had record rainfall for the last few days and their were mudslides all over the county and our mudslide was one of many (and not very significant). They thought that ours wasn’t caused by heavy rain, but by some kind of river that we made that is running over the edge of our property. When they realized that there wasn’t any water running over the edge, they left promising, in a threatening way, to “be back!”. Ooh, scary.

Background on these women: one woman has never seen what happened on 9/11 because, as she proudly declares, they don’t own a television, as if anyone who owns a television isn’t as enlightened as she is. Classic Vashon. The other friend didn’t like our dog because she barked at her car when she drove by our house so one day when she didn’t realize I was watching, she drove really slowly by our house, waited for Illy to walk over (she’s old, it takes her a while) and had her kid spray something (I don’t know what it was; I hope just water) from a spray bottle at her when she got near enough. I ran down the driveway when I saw that and she sped off. She was teaching her kid how to be cruel to animals, I guess. Classic Vashole. I shouldn’t be surprised that they don’t understand what heavy rain and gravity does to steep slopes.</p>

<p>I called the husband of one of these women to talk about the slide rationally. He apologized for his wife’s attitude that morning and we had a decent conversation about what to do to prevent any more damage.</p>

<p>In summary, they needed a favor from us and their first idea was to come at us aggressively demanding it. When that didn’t work, they decided to be polite.</p>

<p>Update: We had a geotech come over the next morning to look at the slide. He was unimpressed. In fact, he was concerned the road below because it is filled with cracks, meaning that slides are imminent below the road. He suggested putting straw down on our slope to prevent any more sediment from coming down, but as expected, he just said that this is life on a steep slope and you can’t fight nature and gravity. I called the neighbor to report what the geotech said and left a voice mail message. I never heard a thing, I assume because we haven’t had much rain since and there haven’t been any more slides. I imagine they’ll just wait for the next problem to react to (and be angry at us over) rather than try to be proactive. The motto of the ignorant: blame everyone else for your problems and expect others to solve them for you. I just hope that no one is driving a car on their road when it gives out.</p>

              <p>Due to the snow storm Thanksgiving week, Kelly didn’t work. We asked her if she wanted to make up the hours by staying overnight with the kids while we had one last date night before baby #3 arrived. She did so we also scheduled ourselves to due the low-voltage electrical work at the house too.</p>

<p>At the house, we figured out the runs for the wires and Mark set me up with a handy right-angle drill to drill through the joists. The old joists were tough to drill through so it too me a while to drill through about 30 joists in the kitchen/family room. By then, it was quittin’ time so we left and went to the hotel, <a href="http://www.hotel1000seattle.com/index.php">Hotel 1000</a>.</p>

<p>We took showers, got dressed and went to the bar for a complimentary cocktail and then walked a couple blocks to dinner at <a href="http://www.lecosho.com/">Lecosho</a>, a place <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2010/10/20/dinner-at-lecosho/">we went to in October</a>.  Great dinner.</p>

<p>Friday morning, we woke up without kids waking us up. We ordered room service for breakfast, left the hotel and went back to the house. I marked out the cable runs in the master bedroom and bathroom and then finished holes through double joints in the kitchen that I couldn’t do the night before without a drill extension. While Gay went through the light switch and outlet placement with the electrician, I ran the Cat6 cables from the basement through the kitchen and family room ceiling and down the west wall.</p>

<p>I think the hardest part is done. There were a lot of joists I had to drill through in the kitchen and because the wood was so hard, it was harder than I expected to drill through the joists. There are fewer joists to drill through in the master bath and bedroom and in the dining room. We’re going to go back Monday to see how much of that we can get done.</p>

              <p>18 months ago, Illy had “sudden dizziness”. Last week, she got it again. This time it took longer to go away and when it did, she still wouldn’t eat or drink much. By the time she wouldn’t even get up and couldn’t keep food down we called the vet. They sent someone over (vet housecall!) to look at her today.</p>

<p>We ended up giving her an IV of fluid to see if she feels better. A few hours later and she was noticeably happier and more alert and even ate chicken and rice. We’re going to give her Kaopectate (to calm her stomach) and Tramadol (for arthritis pain) for a few days and she if she improves.</p>

<p>She is 15, which is very old for a Labrador, so these things are to be expected.</p>
