              <p>Havana and Hudson recently learned to ride their bikes without training wheels.They’ve been riding with just one training wheel for a while and several weeks ago felt confident enough to ask me to take the other wheel off. I did, but we’re both frustrated by the difficulty.</p>

<p>Then, Hudson went with me to the bike shop so I could get some patch kits and he wanted a water bottle “like the Tour de France riders have”. I told him he could get one when he learns to ride his bike. That became the motivation for him. He immediately started trying to ride his bike in the basement. He had some success right away and that (plus some encouragement) got him through about an hour of frustrating falling down. By dinner time he was doing loops around the basement and was very proud of himself.</p>

<p>Havana saw him riding and was excited for him — he was less encouraging of her as she learned over the next couple days. She went out with me and Hudson for a couple nights as I walked Barley and Hudson  rode his bike. Like Hudson, the switch turned on suddenly and she was riding too!</p>

<p>One of my earliest memories is learning to ride a bike. That free feeling from riding a bike for the first time is something I haven’t forgotten and what I see in the kids today. It’s fun to see how excited and proud they get at their accomplishment, which I guess is the payoff of parenthood.</p>

              <p>I took Hudson to the Huskies game today. He couldn’t see when everyone stood up and was “overheating” in the sun. He made it to halftime before a bathroom break, a pretzel and a cupcake. We spent the 2nd half on the concourse in the shade. Huskies lost 20-13 but it was a close game. </p>

<p>After the game, Chloe came to babysit and Gay and I went out to dinner at <a href="http://terraplata.com/">Terra Plata</a> before a great talk by <a href="http://robertreich.org/">Robert Reich</a> at <a href="http://www.townhallseattle.org/">Town Hall</a>.</p>

              <p>The kids and I picked my 2nd-year hops today. I joked that they should go pick the hops for me but they wanted to and loved it, especially climbing on the ladder and talking about how much beer they’re gonna make. </p>

<p>One of the vines did better than the others… left to right, Chinook, Cascade, Centennial and Columbus:</p>

<p>We watched “Muppets Most Wanted” after dinner and Havana said she liked picking hops more than the movie. And she asked if we could pick hops every year. Weird; you never know what they’ll like.</p>

              <p>I’ve noticed a clicking in the elliptical machine for the last couple weeks so I decided to open it up and see what the problem is. I found a broken piece of steel in the left crank arm. That must mean my legs are stronger than steel!</p>

<p>I zip-tied the broken piece to keep it from moving so I can keep using it. This machine has been a big part of my life for almost 8 years but it’s time to retire it and get a new one.</p>

<p><a href="https://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/img_4881.jpg"><img src="https://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/img_4881.jpg" alt="IMG_4881.JPG" /></a></p>

<p>Update: the very next run broke it for good. The bolt on the other side of the arm snapped while I was running — surprised I didn’t get hurt.</p>
