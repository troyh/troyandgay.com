          </h3>
            <p>Since the iPad 2 is going on sale today, we decided to go the house again so I could do some work and Gay could go to <a href="http://www.albertleeappliance.com/seattle.php">Albert Lee</a> and <a href="http://www.builders-hardware.com/default.aspx">Builder’s Hardware</a> to look at stuff. We took the kids with us too so we could go to dinner before getting the iPad. I hate waiting in lines, so I wasn’t going to wait in line for the iPad and was hoping that I could walk in a couple hours later and pick one up.</p>

<p>Since the drywallers were done with their work and would start working on the patched areas around the house, I had to finally move the living room speaker holes. I had originally made holes down the center line of the room, but after getting <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/02/04/noble-fidelity-speakers/">an education on speaker placement from Noble Fidelity</a>, I wanted to move them closer to the wall. Using a Fein tool, I cut the plaster out and then the lathes out and could pull the speaker wire from the other hole to the new ones. Cutting plaster is a dirty job, especially when it’s on the ceiling, so I was covered in plaster dust. Then I went to the garage to finish a small bit of masonite and tried screwing-down the existing masonite because it all bubbled since I installed it. More screws helped most of it, but there’s a couple sheets that need to be re-done.</p>

<p>The fireplace was delivered today, so I got to see that. It should go in next week. The drywallers were priming the attic, the last of the priming work. They finished that today so the entire house is drywalled, taped, mudded and primed. The tile guy was still working on the basement bath tile and almost finished. It looks fantastic, much better than I was expecting because this tile was chosen as a less expensive version of the one we chose for the master bath. Now I’m worried that the master bath tile won’t look good enough to justify the cost – how much better can it be? Kurt and Colin were putting the wood trim around the windows that have all been replaced and painted.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, the short concrete wall around the top of the garage was removed to make way for the decking and to allow water to drain off the side rather than through a drain in the center. Now we can get rid of the drain because I hate drains – they’re always clogged, require maintenance and you’re just throwing the water away into the sewer system instead of using it for irrigation.</p>

<p>Gay went to Albert Lee to look at refrigerators. The one she wants is super expensive and I’ve been trying to get her to find a less expensive alternative. I hadn’t been successful yet but I suggested getting a commercial refrigerator and freezer from <a href="http://truemfg.com/">True</a> that also look just as cool, but are much much cheaper. It turns out those are very loud, way too loud for a residential environment, which I wouldn’t like. They also lack the consumer-friendly features like crisper drawers, adjustable bins and easy-to-clean shelves. She told the sales guy at Albert Lee that I’ve been complaining about the cost and, since we’re buying so much stuff (fridge, beverage fridge, beer fridge, ice-maker, stove &amp; oven, vent hood, microwave, dishwasher, washer &amp; dryer) at one time, he could knock of a few hundred dollars here and there and, with the current Sub-Zero/Wolf sale, we ended up getting more than $4,000 off. So sometimes whining works (don’t tell the kids!). Even with the discount, the fridge is still more than any other fridge, but it looks better than any other fridge and I can’t argue with Sub-Zero quality and the customer service we’ve had with the 20 year-old Sub-Zero in our current house – it’s been problem-free and they replaced the entire ice-maker system for free a couple years ago when Gay told them she didn’t like to see the minerals in the ice (which we think ended up being caused by Vashon’s harder water).</p>

<p>After I was done working, we went to the Apple store down the street at U Village and found a line that wrapped around the entire block and then some. I was afraid of that. We went next door the Ram Brewery for dinner to wait out the line. We also ran into Steve, Renuka and their kids there. At 7pm the line was still there but much shorter so I went in but found that they were sold out of iPads. Oh well. I wish Apple did the reservation system they did last year for the original iPad so I could reserve it and walk right in to pick it up, but I guess they really wanted to see long lines – sometimes Apple’s anti-customer/pro-marketing dark side rears its ugly head.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We met <a href="http://scoteckley.com/pages/home.php">Scot Eckley</a>, the landscape designer we hired, to go over the designs he’s been working on. He came with three designs, which is what we like to see. Multiple unique designs gives us the chance to see different ways of doing the same thing, to pick and choose the best of each and to merge them together. It’s also much quicker. We didn’t ask for 3 designs, he just showed up with 3.</p>

<p>We had a our monthly project review meeting with Schuchart/Dow and they got to see the landscape designs too and give us some feedback from their point-of-view.</p>

<p>I’m not a fan of designers, in general, given our experiences with them in our careers. A good designer can do two things: 1) be creative and 2) understand how people use what they’re designing. Very few people who call themselves designers can do even one of those, and almost none of them can do both. This is why we love Tom Kundig so much, he excels at both (moreover, he’s efficient). Scot did a great job, he had 3 very unique designs and all had clever ideas in them like a hidden sandbox, an outdoor chalkboard and a swing attachment for the kids. We couldn’t have been happier with what he showed us and how sharp he is as a designer.</p>

<p>We took the designs home and later in the evening we went through them again and, to my surprise, we came up with what we think is the best design: it’s a merging of 2 of them with some slight changes. The 3rd design was practically dismissed altogether, but it helped us figure out what we didn’t want, so even it was useful. We’re very excited to get that started. And just in time too, the decks will change a bit and Schuchart/Dow is getting ready to start framing the decks.</p>

<p>Gay likes to remind me that Scot is the reason we even have this house in Seattle. We originally had him over to our Vashon house two years ago to talk about landscaping the yard. He had good ideas that led us to consider making changes to the house. That snowballed into changing more things in the house and ultimately deciding to change the entire thing and <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2009/06/29/our-architect/">build a whole new house</a>! For other reasons, we eventually decided to just move and, a year later, we bought the house in Seattle. Now Scot’s designing our yard, but an entirely different one than we originally talked to him about doing.</p>

            <p>We went into Seattle three times this week, Monday, Wednesday and Friday. While Gay ran errands, I worked on putting in flooring in the garage at the house.</p>

<p>Today, Gay met with Nancy and My at NB Design’s office to go over furniture, fabrics and paint colors. I was supposed to go, but I get bored quickly talking about that stuff and I wanted to stay at the house and continue working.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5497726102/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5177/5497726102_971986e9d7.jpg" alt="NB Design's proposed colors and fabrics: Lounge" /></a></p>

<p>I was debriefed on it later and Gay brought home all the furniture configurations for me to see. In addition to their preferred furniture picks, they provided us with a thick binder of alternative furniture pieces, organized by room. It’s tough for them to pick furniture for the house because we want two styles, a more traditional style but edging towards modern for the main floors and a more modern/rustic/casual style for the basement and attic. They are mostly a modern interior design firm, so they’re going against their grain a little with the traditional styles and, frankly, we’re not much help because we don’t know exactly what we want either. They did great with the lounge, though, which is in the traditional part. I’d say about half of the rest of the house we like, the other half needs some more work.</p>

<p>The hardest part is picking wall sconces and chandeliers. I just don’t like much of anything I see. They picked a great chandelier by <a href="http://www.alisonbergerglassworks.com/">Alison Berger</a>, who I’d never heard of, for the dining room that I thought was great and I was happy until I found out how much it cost. We also have to pick a chandelier for foyer and the living room and I don’t know how we’re going to do those either.</p>

            <p>I had to go for my checkup with the opthamologist after <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/02/18/metal-in-my-eye/">he fixed my eye</a> – it’s healing perfectly – and Gay had a haircut appointment, so we went into Seattle this morning. We went to the house and talked to Mark about some things. Katie happened to stop by and we talked to her about some things. Then Tom, the tile guy, came over and we talked about the problem tile in the master bath. More on that later…</p>

<p>The garage was finished being framed last week and they put the floor down. A few weeks ago, I bought the hardware for the door (hinges and lifts) and I wanted to help build the trapdoor. I didn’t get a chance to build the actual door, but they waited for me to get there and put the hardware on. Colin showed me how to use a hand router and made the guide for one handle. I finished routing that one out, this time with my new safety glasses!, and then marked and routed out the space for the other handle.</p>

<p>The plywood on the door is 3/4” plywood and the handle recess is 11/16”, so there was just 1/16” of plywood covering the bottom of the handle. It took a while to rout out the handle recess rather than just use a jigsaw to cut the hole out completely, so I asked Colin why we didn’t just cut it out. He looked at me and said “But you’d see it from below.”  I like his attention to detail and concern with aesthetics!</p>

<p>He marked the hinges and I routed out the space for those. We mounted them and the door was almost done. Colin took a planer to the one side of the door so that it could open without rubbing against the opening. We then screwed down the other side of the hinges into the floor and we had a working trapdoor!</p>

<p>When I opened it for the first time I realized a problem I didn’t anticipate: it’s such a big door that when you lift it your momentum pulls you forward and towards the hole in the floor. It’s about 12 feet down to the garage floor, so it’s not a comfortable feeling. Worse, I instantly had the thought of the kids playing with it and falling through. We will need to put a lock on it and maybe find a way to make it open by itself once it’s started. There will usually be a car below it, so your fall would be broken by the car after falling just a few feet, but Murphy’s Law says that the time you do fall, the car won’t be there.</p>

<p>Before we left, I quickly sanded off some of the paint on the beam and rafter structure above the front door to see what was underneath. Aside from colors and the decks outside, we’ve ignored the exterior of the house. I always imagined those things as big rustic wood beams, but we never knew what they were made of. I assumed it’d be cheap wood and we’d either have to just paint them or do something to make them look better. I was happy to discover that they are made of, according to Colin, <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=vg+fir&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1ZNmTcjeKoLSsAO4l-ymBA&amp;ved=0CEAQsAQ&amp;biw=1199&amp;bih=1449">vertical-grain Douglas Fir</a>! I think we can sand off the paint and put a clear coat on them and they’ll look great. I may even get to do this myself as I’m running out of things I am qualified to do at the house.</p>
