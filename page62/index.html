<p>We were watching 60 Minutes when a news crawl came across the screen announcing that Obama was going to deliver an address to the nation. We quickly checked the Internet and saw the headlines that Bin Laden is dead. </p>

<p>Things I love about the story so far:
<!-- more -->
He was killed, not captured. No 5-year media circus trial. He wasn’t found dead, we went and got him. </p>

<p>No Americans were killed in the operation, which involved a fire fight. We did it perfectly – Mission Accomplished! Allah didn’t care about helping him, even on a Sunday. </p>

<p>He was killed in a mansion. He wasn’t in a cave suffering for the Muslim struggle, he was living large in a mansion. Hypocrite. </p>

<p>Obama pointed out that Bin Laden killed Muslims in his attacks: “He’s not a Muslim leader, he’s a mass-murderer of Muslims.”</p>

<p>There must be tons of evidence inside that house pointing to the other idiots in al-Qaeda. Their days are numbered. </p>

<p>One of Bin Laden’s sons was killed. Like in The Godfather, you can’t leave sons to avenge his father’s death. </p>

<p>A woman in the house was killed because she was used as a human shield by Bin Laden’s security. Assholes from beginning to end. <strong>Update:</strong> the woman was one of Bin Laden’s wives and he himself used her to shield himself from gunfire. Classy guy.</p>

              <p>Havana’s 4 years old today. It’s hard for me to believe 4 years have passed already. </p>

<p>I hope you read this years from now (and I hope I’m still around when you do):</p>

<p>Havana, I’m amazed how much you change and grow up so quickly. It seems just recently you could barely walk or talk and today you ask me to chase you around the house and you have actual conversations with me about your day. You talk a lot  about how you can’t wait to grow up and get bigger. I wish you’d grow up slower – soon, I won’t be able to carry you or lift you over my head and you won’t even want me to carry you on my shoulders or ride on my back like you’re riding an elephant.</p>

<p>You’re a great big sister to Hudson (and I’m sure you will be to Eva too), you’ve taught him a lot and, you don’t realize this and won’t believe it when you read this, but he rarely refuses you, always listens to everything you say, mimics everything you do and looks up to you. If only you could finish potty-training him because we can’t seem to.</p>

<p>Four years ago, you were a challenge that I didn’t think I could handle, and sometimes you still are today, and you prove almost daily how unprepared I am to be a dad. Nevertheless, I’m glad I’m your dad and I’ll always do what I can to help you have a happy life.</p>

              <p>We took our bouncy house to Havana’s school today and Gay made cupcakes so she could celebrate her birthday with her school friends. She likes butterflies, or “papillons”, so she requested “butterfly cupcakes”. Gay had to get creative:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5665592227/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5230/5665592227_94a0abdc7b.jpg" alt="IMG_6709" /></a></p>

<p>Everyone sang “Happy Birthday” to her in French and then they ate their cupcakes. Then we all went outside to play in the bouncy house for an hour. That tired them all out and there were only a couple injuries and crying kids, which is pretty good.</p>

              <p>The sauna heater arrived at our house this week so we took that with us to the new house this morning to do some work. The security company installed the new monitoring devices (motion detectors, door contacts, smoke detectors) on Monday and Tuesday and we had our electrician install the cameras. I wish we had our electrician install the motion detectors and door contacts too because they ran new wiring, which I didn’t expect, and didn’t run it in conduit so it doesn’t look as cool in the exposed basement ceiling as all the other electrical does. We will have to have our electrician re-run that wiring. </p>

<p>Nancy and My came to look at more paint colors for interior and exterior. They’re almost done with all the color selections but are having trouble picking a few colors so asked for yet more paint samples to be done. They’ve done, I think, 8 samples for the living room alone and aren’t happy with any of them. They also guided the install of mock-up chandeliers in the main staircase. The carpenters built three mock-ups of the lights we’re going to get and needed to know where the wiring for them needed to be installed in the ceiling above. Mark climbed a tall ladder to mount temporary brackets on the ceiling with clamps and hang each of the lights and adjust their height.</p>

<p>I hooked up the DVR for the security cameras while Bill, the electrician, adjusted the cameras – he even had to fix one that arrived non-functional. I also assembled the cabinet for all the audio/video equipment in the house so that’s ready to go when I start the trim-out work for the audio/video equipment next month. </p>

<p>We did a walk-through with Bill to finalize all the light switches and outlets that we need to get. We’re buying all of those ourselves to avoid the P&amp;O charge from the contractor. They and the sub-contractors have been very good about letting us buy things like that (plumbing fixtures, appliances, door hardware, etc) and delivering it to them for installation. We also planned electrical and lighting for the garage with Bill.</p>

<p>The cabinetry installers were there installing the faces on my closet cabinetry and Gay’s closet cabinetry is almost all installed too. Tile was being installed in the guest bath. A new wall panel was built and installed in the dining room to match the rest of the walls; the wall between the kitchen and dining room was almost completely removed but there’s a short length of wall remaining and needed to match the rest of the room’s wood wainscoting. A new basement mudroom door was also installed.</p>

<p>Next week, the new doors for the family room will be delivered and installed, which I’m looking forward to and want to be there to watch those get installed. The door jambs alone are 700 lbs so Mark is planning to use a crane to lift them. Hudson would love to see that, I bet!</p>
