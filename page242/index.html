            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>It’s the start of Thanksgiving week, which is the biggest week on <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> traffic-wise. December is huge because of Christmas and New Year’s, but that traffic surge is spread out over a couple weeks. Thanksgiving’s traffic is concentrated in three days: Monday will be our biggest day in our history, Tuesday is even bigger, Wednesday is huge and Thursday the traffic just drops at about 9am our time as people are finishing their food and sitting down to eat. History has shown that our Thanksgiving traffic sets the bar for what the following year averages month-to-month. So this week helps us project our growth for next year.</p>

<p>This demonstrates an unexpected advantage in running a cooking site: the traffic spikes are very predictable since they coincide with American holidays. Even Halloween and St. Patrick’s Day are big cooking holidays we’ve learned. As the internet population becomes more global, I expect this to change so that our spikes coincide with every holiday around the globe.</p>

<p>It’s exciting to watch the live stats on the servers that gauge their performance during this week. Last year went well, after <a href="http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2502">we had an emergency repair</a> a week before Thanksgiving Day. Over the course of 2004, we’ve added quite a bit of horsepower and made some significant software performance improvements so we’re confident enough that we decided not to add any additional hardware before Thanksgiving. So this week will tell us how smart/stupid that decision was.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> At 10am today, our hourly traffic for both  hours between 8am and 10am blew away our highest hourly traffic ever. And daily traffic generally peaks from noon to 3pm, so those three hours are going to be interesting today.</p>

<p><strong>Update #2:</strong> By the end of the day, our total traffic was 50% higher than the monthly average. Looking back at last year, it wasn’t until Wednesday that we hit 50% increase for the day. So even if Tuesday and Wednesday this year are the same as yesterday, we’ve done significantly better than last year!</p>

              <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2247.jpg" alt="IMG_2247.jpg" />Yesterday, we went to look at carpet samples. This time we went to the local Vashon furniture store, of all places, and were surprised to find a good selection there. We have a carpet we think we like. And then we put primer on the walls to prep for painting.</p>

<p>We’re still deciding what colors to paint the walls and trim. We got some samples yesterday but didn’t like them once we put them on the wall, but we got a better idea about the direction we want to go. We went to the hardware store and picked out more samples to try out. We’ll put those on after the Steelers game…</p>

<p>…Steelers won! We painted some colors on the wall. I think we’re set on the white for the walls and for the carpet, but the trim color is still a problem. We want the windows to show all the color of the outdoors so we want the interior colors to be less noticeable so as not to detract from the windows.</p>

              <p>The drywall guys keep coming back for just a couple hours to put another coat on the new drywall. It looks done at this point. But they said yesterday they have to come back this morning for 20 minutes to put primer on.</p>

<p>Not exactly sure what’s next, either we’re going to paint the walls or they’re going to trim the window frames. The electrical work needs to be finished up, meaning putting the plates and jacks in and installing the in-wall heaters. After that, we’ll paint the trim and decide on flooring and get that installed. Then it’s done.</p>

<p>We’ve been thinking we’d do bamboo flooring, but now we’re thinking carpet instead. It’s less expensive, will be more durable against our dogs’ claws, Illy doesn’t like wood floors and carpet will be warmer. Decisions, decisions…</p>

              <p>I finally solved the <a href="http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2709">Airport Express problem</a> I’ve had since I got it. The Airport Express would simply “drop-out” for a second or more. This wasn’t that noticeable when streaming music since iTunes buffers so much that a short loss of network connectivity had no effect. But when I used it to <a href="http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2888">set up our temporary office</a>, the drops were much more noticeable since I live in ssh sessions to various servers.</p>

<p>After lots of trial and error, I simply unplugged our older Linksys access point. It’s an 802.11b access point and the Express was getting confused between it and the newer 802.11g access point also in the house. Not a single dropped connection since! Fortunately, it doesn’t appear that we need the 802.11b since the greater range of the 802.11g access point seems to cover the house.</p>
