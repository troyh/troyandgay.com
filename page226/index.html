          <p>USATODAY <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/admeter/2005-ad-meter-results-chart.htm">reports</a> that Napster’s Do The Math SuperBowl ad flopped, finishing dead last in the rankings. Why are supposedly smart companies so dumb? Not only is their math wrong, 99¢ x 10,000=$9,900, not $10,000, the reason no one cares is that Napster doesn’t work with the iPod. Make a good MP3 player that people want before you start trying to compete on price. And no one wants to rent music anyway. Besides, the majority of the music on my iPod are from CDs I bought before I had an iPod, so it’s misleading to claim that you have to pay $10,000 after buying an iPod.</p>

          <p>We both find Steve Jobs a very inspirational figure.  OSX and the iPod are truly amazing products for their innovation and simplicity.  <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/oct2004/nf20041012_4018_db083.htm">This Businessweek interview with Jobs</a> captures a fundamental truth in a pithy answer about how businesses stop innovating, and describes much of what I experienced about Microsoft causing me to leave:</p>

<blockquote>
People always ask me why did Apple really fail for those years, and it's easy to blame it on certain people or personalities. Certainly, there was some of that. But there's a far more insightful way to think about it. Apple had a monopoly on the graphical user interface for almost 10 years. That's a long time. And how are monopolies lost? Think about it. Some very good product people invent some very good products, and the company achieves a monopoly.

But after that, the product people aren't the ones that drive the company forward anymore. It's the marketing guys or the ones who expand the business into Latin America or whatever. Because what's the point of focusing on making the product even better when the only company you can take business from is yourself?

So a different group of people start to move up. And who usually ends up running the show? The sales guy. John Akers at IBM (IBM ) is the consummate example. Then one day, the monopoly expires for whatever reason. But by then the best product people have left, or they're no longer listened to. And so the company goes through this tumultuous time, and it either survives or it doesn't.

Q: Is this common in the industry?
A: Look at Microsoft (MSFT ) -- who's running Microsoft?

Q: Steve Ballmer.
A: Right, the sales guy. Case closed. And that's what happened at Apple, as well.</blockquote>

<p>Making great products is the most important driving force.  We’ve always said the money will follow – maybe not Microsoft money, but the kind of money that will allow us to keep making great products.  So far that has proven to be true, and we are slowly moving to a place where our primary customer will be actual people who use our software, rather than advertisers, so that we can continue to build great products for individuals instead of marketers.</p>

<p>Jobs also mentioned how the <a href="http://www.redlightrunner.com/rarthinpos.html">“Think Different”</a> marketing campaign was as much for Apple to remember who its heroes are, as it was for advertising.  Isn’t it important to know who your hereos are in order to be inspired at your own job?</p>

          <p>Gay &amp; I went to <a href="http://www.cityoftacoma.org/10Home/default.asp">Tacoma</a> this morning to attend the funeral service for Gene McTee, who died suddenly of a stroke last week at the age of 72. Gene’s wife of 50 years, Shirley, and my mom are cousins so we went to the service since my mom and dad couldn’t (they live in Florida). I had met them a few times while my parents were visiting Seattle the last few years and they attended our wedding last summer, which was the last time I saw Gene.</p>

          <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/t49635oij78.jpg" alt="bcta" />After a string of real stinkers (we’re still arguing about who put <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chasing_liberty/">Chasing Liberty</a> on our Blockbuster queue), we’ve resumed my “Alice’s” film fest by seeing <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bob_and_carol_and_ted_and_alice/">“Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice”</a> (a follow up to <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/alice_doesnt_live_here_anymore/">“Alice Doesn’t Live Here Any More”</a>).  Troy thought a wife-swapping (I say “husband-swapping”) movie was in poor taste so soon after our own wedding, but the movie less about swinging,  than the emptiness in certain truth-telling in relationships, not just Bob &amp; Carol’s but also Carol &amp; Alice’s….  The most hilarious scene is the one with Ted &amp; Alice in the bedroom trying to negotiate sex.  It would be difficult to put my finger on another movie that highlighted more clearly the difference between men and women.</p>
