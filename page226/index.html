              <p>After weeks of web designers complaining, Google may start to listen since <a href="http://ptech.wsj.com/archive/ptech-20050310.html">Walt Mossberg comes down on it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Still, the feature has disturbing consequences for Web site owners. In my tests, for instance, it added links to the addresses of movie theaters I had called up in a Yahoo page, and the links took me to Google Maps, not to Yahoo's own map page. When I looked up a book on eCampus, a book-selling site, AutoLink turned the ISBN numbers on the page into links to Amazon, which competes with eCampus to sell the books. When I looked up a used car for sale on AutoTrader, AutoLink turned the VIN numbers into links to Carfax, not to a competing auto-history-report seller, AutoCheck, used by AutoTrader.</blockquote>

<p>Proponents of AutoLink, including Google, argue that it’s a feature that benefits the user and/or that the user has a right to do whatever they want with content that is given to them. That’s true, but Google is the one doing this, <em>not the user</em>.</p>

They are asked, like we always are, how can you possibly be around each other 24/7 and work together too.  I just loved the way Brent answers:</p>

<blockquote>We laugh at the same stuff and enjoy so many of the same things. We like being able to do things like take a walk around the neighborhood after lunch. We like being able to play with the cat [dogs in our case] whenever he wants.

It's a little bit like farm life -- but modern, urban, digital farm life. We grow software.</blockquote>

<p>Gay  and I both read this and thought “That’s just like us!” (except the cat is a dog). We should meet these two someday, they’re right here in Seattle and we use their products (<a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire">NetNewsWire</a> and <a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit">MarsEdit</a>).</p>
