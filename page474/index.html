<p>Mostly I just thought this quote was funny…</p>

<p>Mr. Perlman says he wrote a note to Steve Ballmer, then ‘s No. 2 man and now its chief executive officer, complaining about technical glitches in Office’s Outlook e-mail product. Mr. Perlman had been testing the product because  wanted WebTV employees to switch to Outlook after  acquired WebTV, Mr. Perlman recalls.A manager in the Office group who responded to the note on Mr. Ballmer’s behalf was “outraged” at the complaint about Outlook, Mr. Perlman says. The manager wrote back, “My job is not making Outlook reliable. My job is killing Lotus Notes,” a competing product sold by IBM, Mr. Perlman says.</p>

          <p>Obviously, Linux TCO is lower than Windows TCO (and ridiculously lower than Solaris TCO), at <a href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2002-10-08-019-26-NW-BZ-MR">40% of the cost</a>, but the interesting thing is that Windows admins can’t run from machine to machine pointing &amp; clicking as fast as Unix admins can ssh around the network: <em>The Windows technicians, however, only managed an average of 10 machines each, while Linux or Solaris admins can generally handle several times that.</em></p>

          <p>A great idea to keep subscription renewals high is from <a href="http://www.econtentmag.com/r16/2002/smith8_02.html"> American Greetings subscriptions Family Plan</a>: <em>But AG’s real ace in the hole, its killer retention app, could be the Family Plan. New subscribers actually get three accounts,two of which can be handed over to friends and relatives. In this truly inspired example of true Web marketing, AG has woven its business model into the P2P appeal of ecards by tying one person’s subscription to another’s. When the primary subscriber cancels or fails to renew, all the attached accounts go dead as well. The company is hoping that for the low price of $11.95, a paying subscriber will think twice or thrice at renewal time before cutting off Aunt Lucy’s “free” ecard account.</em></p>
