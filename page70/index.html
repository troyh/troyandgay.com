          <p>We had to bring the permit and permitted drawings to the house because they have to be on-site and the contractor wants to call the inspector on Tuesday to have the first inspection appointment. So we took the kids into the city and, after a quick stop at <a href="http://www.thebeerjunction.com/">The Beer Junction</a> for a fresh supply of beer and then to the house, we had dinner. We tried to go to <a href="http://www.alwaysfreshgoodness.com/">Volunteer Park Cafe</a> but they weren’t open for dinner. Next try was <a href="http://thekingfishcafe.com/">Kingfish Cafe</a>, which was open at 5:30 with a line of people waiting outside for the doors to open.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>We hadn’t been to Kingfish Cafe in 10 years! Time flies. It’s great to have a neighborhood place like this so close to the house. We had catfish crab cakes for appetizer while the kids had mac &amp; cheese. For dinner, I had the blackened salmon and Gay had the catfish. Everything was great, especially the kids’ Mac &amp; cheese. Havana ate a lot of hers but Hudson was happy with his lemonade and an apple. I ate most of his but did get him to eat some of it, and he agreed it was very good. They played with an iPhone and iPad while we finished our dinners.</p>

<p>For dessert, we went to <a href="http://www.mollymoonicecream.com/ice-cream-shops">Molly Moon</a> for ice cream and then went to <a href="http://www.calandersonpark.org/">Cal Anderson Park</a>, one of the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/11/18/best-city-parks-lifestyle-travel-central-park.html">12 best city parks in the US</a>, across the street. Havana was having so much fun she refused to eat half her ice cream. It eventually melted and we threw it away and then she wanted it when we got in the car to go home. We didn’t get home until 9pm, they kids were tired and went right to sleep.</p>

        <article>
          <p>The <a href="http://www.nbdesigngroup.net/">interior designers</a> completed the first round of elevations for the rooms they’re doing: the kitchen, all the bathrooms and the laundry room. 30 pages of drawings! These specify the exact locations of sinks, faucets, appliances, wall sconces, cabinetry, shelving, shower heads and controls (even the locations of toilet paper holders) as well as wall and floor surfaces. They also included a complete list of fixtures and tiles, although we aren’t yet decided on all of those yet.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>They also had to decide how the kitchen windows would be changed to fit the new kitchen. They surprised us by doing just one big window rather than two on either side of the stove. I don’t know why we never considered a single window; it looks great. They also got my shower controls on the outside of the shower, something I’ve wanted in a shower for decades – I hate having to get into the shower to turn it on and try not to get a splash of freezing cold water on me and my clothes. They also did a nice laundry room cabinetry design with a built-in drying rack and ironing board.</p>

<p>We have some changes we want to make but, as they’ve always done with us, they got 90% of everything right on the first try.</p>

          <p>It took a few more days than planned, but Todd at Olson Kundig got the documentation together today. Gay went in to pick it up and take it to the <a href="http://www.cityofseattle.net/dpd/">Seattle DPD</a> to get our permit.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4953961393/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4080/4953961393_2847631401.jpg" alt="Permitted to build!" /></a></p>

<p>The structural engineer had some concerns about the changes we were making and initially said we’d need to add three beams to the main floor, a floor we are trying not to disturb at all, and reinforce the concrete footings in the basement. He asked to see the existing structure in the walls and ceilings in the first floor and to see the basement foundation. Schuchart/Dow opened up a couple walls and dug into the basement floor to give him access. He did his math and determined that the existing house structure is good enough. It turns out that the main floor had two steel beams at the north and south walls of the foyer. This house sure was built well. How many houses built in 1909 have steel beams? The footings in the basement also are much deeper than they thought at first.</p>

<p>The structural engineer did require us to strengthen the rafters in the roof because we are adding insulation and drywall to the attic ceiling, which increases the load. And the garage requires a new steel beam because we are lowering the floor above the garage to use for storage and it will carry more weight. The existing steel beam is also very rusty due to water damage from a leaky roof.</p>

<p>The building permit doesn’t cover the garage because the permit clerk couldn’t find any documentation on the garage in the records for the house because it was built so long ago. Without that, he couldn’t be sure that we aren’t changing its original use or even that the garage is legally built. He approved the permit for the house only. He told Gay to go to the microfiche department to find old records of the garage. There was nothing on microfiche, but they did find a building permit for the garage in 1911 in the original Seattle ledger, a book that is practically disintegrating. So this should be adequate evidence to prove that the garage was legally built as a garage. The old permit application also mentions a greenhouse on top of the garage, so that may be enough to prevent it from being considered a “change of use”. Gay got an appointment with the planning review people for September 30 where we can try to get the permit for the garage and, hopefully, do it without a plan review and get it that day.</p>

<p>But at least we can do the work on the load-bearing walls in the house now. And once we get the final estimate from Schuchart/Dow for everything we’re doing, we can work on getting the construction loan.</p>
