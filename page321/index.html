            <p>T-Online, the online arm of Deutsche-Telekom, the German phone company, may <a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/artikel/455/21434/">buy AOL</a>? (<a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/urltrurl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sueddeutsche.de%2Fwirtschaft%2Fartikel%2F455%2F21434%2F&amp;lp=de_en&amp;tt=url">Translation</a>). T-Online has half the subscribers as AOL, but is the #2 online service worldwide. Certainly they’d only buy them for the number of subscribers. So maybe this means the <a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid14_gci554703,00.html">“walled garden”</a> that AOL users find themselves in would disappear? That’d be good for the internet.</p>

            <p>I just upgraded to a new version of a great little app that sits in my menu bar and tells me the current weather and the forecast called <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/heat-meteo">Meteorologist</a>. While checking out the new features, I find this in the About screen:</p>

<p>This is the final release of Meteorologist from Humongous Elephants and Tigers.  I worked on Meteo for quite some time while I attending the University of Illinois, but I am sad to announce that no future development will be done on my part (although many could have guessed that this was coming).</p>

<p>To those who hate my guts - you probably have good reason, and I hope your hatred is doused a little with pity.  I have been woefully behind on emails and updates.  I have plenty of excuses, but that doesn’t really matter.</p>

<p>Meteorologist is now officially out of my hands.  I will be hunting around to find someone to take up the torch, and to try to take up the good fight.</p>

<p>Best of luck to everyone,
Matthew Fahrenbacher</p>

<p>The author gets hate e-mail from people about it so he’s quitting development of it. It’s completely free software! The author does nothing but a positive thing and he gets hate mail about it! Never underestimate how mean people can be to other people.</p>

            <p>Since Red Hat’s announcement that they aren’t supporting free editions of Red Hat Linux, I’ve been considering switching to another Linux distribution, with <a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a> at the top of the list. Then, along comes <a href="http://www.nat.org/">Bruce Perens and his UserLinux</a>, which will be based on Debian. Nice.</p>

<p>Incidentally, that Wired article referenced <a href="http://www.nat.org/">Nat Friedman</a> of <a href="http://www.ximian.com">Ximian</a>. I remembered that he offered me a job as a “VP of Technology” (I hope I am never a VP of anything) a few years ago. I wonder how much <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=novl">Novell stock</a> I’d own right now if I had switched.</p>
