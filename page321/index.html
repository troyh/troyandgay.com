          <p><a href="http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=2173573">The Economist on Google</a>. I think Yahoo is in a much better position than Google is simply because they own <a href="http://overture.com">Overture</a>, Google’s equally-sized rival. Besides, the cost of switching search engines is very low so Google has no real advantage. And I wish Apple would give Safari users a choice of search engines in the search box.</p>

<p>That Microsoft is again <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/31/technology/31net.html">interested in purchasing Google</a> is a non-issue as well. Microsoft is not going to migrate Google’s <a href="http://www.google.com/press/highlights.html">10,000 linux servers</a> to Windows the way they tried, failed, tried, failed, tried and partially-succeeded when they bought Hotmail in 1997.</p>

<p>In my opinion, a Google IPO next year is simply a get-rich-quick scheme by <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/">Kleiner-Perkins</a>.</p>

          <p>Today’s my birthday!</p>

<p>Last night, we went into downtown Vashon where all the local businesses give candy out the kids. I’m impressed at how much effort they put into making it a fun Halloween for the kids. And our friends at <a href="http://www.windermerevashon.com/header.html">Windermere Real Estate</a> once again put on the best show with their “Tomb of Doom”.</p>

<p>We went to the local pub for dinner with our Windermere friends Gary, Nancy, Heather, Larry and others. Everyone at the pub was dressed up in their costumes which was amazing given our small rural community. Nancy, who first heard about our engagement tonight, is ready to help plan the wedding. And that’s good, because I am not looking forward to making decisions about flowers and other stuff women think is important.</p>

<p>I need to get to bed… too many beers and I’m sleepy…</p>

          <p>Another online order that gets shipped FedEx to me was scheduled to be delivered today. After their <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/10/001753.php">last screwups</a>, I was prepared for yet another. And they screwed up again. This time, they are “Unable to locate address” although they deliver things here all the time.</p>

<p>I called. They told me that they aren’t “really sure why” the delivery was not made and that the package will be re-delivered not Monday, but Tuesday. They quickly realized the stupidity of that extra day (without even requiring me to point that out) and then promised twice that it would be delivered on Monday. We’ll see. And once again, they tried to use the “RPS excuse” on me. FedEx bought a company called RPS in 1998 to do ground delivery and “it is taking the company a while” to get the two companies integrated. It’s been <strong>five years</strong>. The federal government can completely change administrations <em>twice</em> in that time period, but FedEx can’t get cell phones to their drivers. They have no way to contact their drivers or for their drivers to contact them to get directions to destinations. What a fly-by-night operation.</p>

<p>Worst delivery service EVER. Incidentally, UPS delivered a package on Wednesday, no problems whatsoever, as usual. Go <a href="http://ups.com">UPS</a>!</p>

<p>This time I’m demanding to get my shipping charges refunded. Of course, they’re not sure that can be done. We’ll see.</p>

<p>On the bright side, I’m the 9th search result in a Google search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=fedex+sucks&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">“FedEx Sucks”</a>.</p>

          <p>A few days ago, <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/10/001767.php">I emailed Steve Ballmer</a> reporting a problem with Windows XP. I actually did get a reply from him the very next day:</p>

<p><code>
We are working diligently on that  did we give you an opportunity to
report the error to us in the error message   did you   thanks so much
for your support
</code></p>

<p>Surprising that the CEO of a large corporation, who is obviously too busy to even use punctuation, actually replied to his email from just some dork. He even had some tech support guy contact me (if you work at Microsoft, when steveb talks, you’d better listen!). And he’s been pretty vigilant, sending me an email every couple days to get more info from me. Of course, my Windows kernel panics often at random times (like everyone’s PC) so it’s pretty pointless, but I commend them on their attempts to resolve it.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m too cynical about the company, but I think the fact that I called him on his claim is the reason Steve Ballmer replied. And I think he missed the original point of my message – admitting bugs is not taking responsibility, actually fixing it and giving your customers the fix for free is taking responsibility. And let’s be honest, anyone who has ever called Microsoft’s tech support is left on hold for hours and then you have to actually pay for the support you get. So, if you ever have trouble with Windows (and I’m sure you do), email steveb@microsoft.com. It’s about the only way you’ll get any response from Microsoft.</p>
