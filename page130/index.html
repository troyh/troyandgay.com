            <p>Amazon updated the Kindle, so Gay finally got her very own. I “got mine”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/07/07/kindle-review/ for Father’s Day and Gay got hers for Valentine’s Day, I guess.</p>

<p>I wish this was the Version 1.0 model, mine looks like a device from the 1970s compared to Kindle 2. They fixed the most annoying things that Kindle 1 had, improved the screen and made it much thinner and more comfortable to hold.</p>

<p>We can even share books that we each buy between our Kindles. Hopefully we can stop collecting piles of books around the house and stop buying and building bookshelves!</p>

          </h3>
            <p>I finally got around to trying to build an iPhone app. I had to learn Objective-C so I spent Sunday reading <em>Programming in Objective-C 2.0</em> (for “free” on “Safari Books Online”:http://my.safaribooksonline.com/, that service pays for itself many times over!) and today I launched XCode and had the beginnings of the app done. Apple could make it easier to learn and XCode could stand a lot of improvement, but two days to get something basic accomplished in a new language and on a new platform is not terrible.</p>

<p>Once you get over the hurdle of understanding the concepts and idioms of the iPhone SDK (probably a lot easier if you’re a Mac developer, which I’m not) it starts to go quicker. The SDK docs are pretty good and have good examples. Objective-C is a much simpler language than C++, which is a good thing, but it also does a lot of things differently for no good reason that I can see.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>For Valentine’s Day dinner we pulled out a bottle of wine that we got in October 2007 during our visit to Portland’s wine country. This was a 2005 Black Cap pinot noir.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3287594131/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3199/3287594131_158cf7178e.jpg" alt="BlackCap Pinot Noir" /></a></p>

<p>Black Cap is the wine made by the son of the founder of “Eyrie Vineyards”:http://www.eyrievineyards.com/journal/, Oregon’s first vineyard and essentially the pioneer of pinot noir in Oregon. “He died a few months ago”:http://www.oregonlive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/10/pioneering_winemaker_eyrie_fou.html, unfortunately.  If I recall the story we were told correctly, Jason’s dad wouldn’t give him the job of winemaker at Eyrie so he made his own wine to prove that he could do it. Today, he is the winemaker at Eyrie, so I guess it worked. :)  “Here’s an article”:http://www.avalonwine.com/Black-Cap-Wine.php on Black Cap and Jason.</p>

<p>Anyway, it was a very good bottle. We generally don’t spend much on wine since I (we) don’t really notice much difference in wines once you get above $15-20/bottle, but on special occasions when we do have a good bottle we appreciate them more.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>The other beer I had this weekend was Deschutes’ Hop Henge. I haven’t read anything about this beer yet, but it tastes like a Double IPA that was also dry-hopped. The aroma is wonderful and it’s got a nice bitter bite with a soft lingering bitter aftertaste. Another great great beer from Deschutes.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>I finally had my first World Wide Stout. This beer is unbelievable. The label reads “A very dark beer brewed with a ridiculous amount of barley”. It takes six months to age too. It’s an 18% ABV beer, which makes it 30% more alcohol than wine and even more potent than the 14% “Raison D’Extra”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/24/dogfish-head-raison-dextra/, but less than their “120 Minute IPA”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/06/08/dogfish-head-120-minute-ipa/. So one bottle is like drinking 3 glasses of wine. It’s almost irresponsible to call this a beer. Plus, it tastes more like a port than a beer. I shared it with Gay and we drank it out of wine glasses. It took me an hour to drink my half!</p>

<p>I haven’t had a beer like this since Sam Adams Triple Bock back in early 1990s. It’s a great beer for sipping, and I loved every sip of it.</p>

<p>I’m either in love with Dogfish Head or they put something else in the beer… last night I dreamt that I visited the Dogfish Head brewery.</p>
