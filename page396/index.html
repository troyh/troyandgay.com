          <p>Spent a few hours on Sunday cleaning the decks and weeding the back yard as Troy mowed.  I don’t know what it is about the soil out here, but the dandelions are HUGE.  Flower/seed stems are at least a foot tall and the plants (not weeds, full-on plants) are more than a foot in diameter.  Satisfying to kill.</p>

          <p>Maybe <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/30621.html">this</a> is the reason Google bought Blogger. Separating weblog content from their main index is good, I think, but how will Google know which sites are weblogs and which aren’t?</p>

          <p>On Friday, the Benders and another Vashon friend, Carol Eggen, came over for dinner (barbequed hamburgers).</p>

<p>On Saturday, we skipped our plans to go the <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/bellevuesquare/">new Apple Store</a>, the first in Seattle. Instead, we worked most of the day, as usual. :(  But we at least took advantage of the great weather and spent a good amount of time outdoors playing with the dogs and just relaxing.</p>

<p>I’m going to make a serious effort to get my weekends back. :)</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2003/05/09/wall-street-scam.html">Wall Street Scam</a>
        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Saw <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/wallstreet/">The Wall Street Fix</a> on <a href="http://pbs.org">PBS</a> last night about the WorldCom debacle. Based on that, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2002/04/25/pf/investing/grubman/">Jack Grubman</a> was the slime ball behind it all, Bernard Ebbers was just the figurehead, and even Alan Greenspan doesn’t come out looking so good (he let Travelers Insurance and Citibank bend the rules to do an illegal merger which made the financing of Worldcom possible). It ended with tiny penalties to the people involved. Jack Grubman was fined less than one year’s salary and was fired from his job, but given a $30 million severance package (which was 2x his penalty). “Steal $5 and you’re a thief, steal $5 million and your a financier”.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/">Eliot Spitzer</a> let these guys get away with serious crimes, but it’s hard to fault him. He did more than anyone else did, but was unlikely to have a significant victory in a prolonged trial against well-financed lawyers. And the Bush Administration doesn’t have a great track record of enforcing laws against wealthy people and corporations. It’ll be interesting to see what happens to the Enron and Worldcom execs on trial by the SEC.</p>
