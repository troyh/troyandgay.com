              <p>Just finished <a href="http://www.transportermovie.com/home.html">The Transporter</a>, an action movie with the guy from <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&amp;cf=info&amp;id=1800023087">Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</a> (which I loved) and <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/movies/reviews/movie/386066">Snatch</a>. The plot is pretty undeveloped and oddly unexplained, but the point of the movie is the action – which is pretty good. The initial driving scene is great (in a BMW 735!) then his choice of cars plummets throughout the movie as does the action in the car scenes. Lots of fight scenes, mostly typical, but there’s a cool fight scene in oil and uses parts of a bike pretty well. Overall, entertaining but I was glad it was only 92 minutes.</p>

<p>Tomorrow night’s movie is <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/XXX-1112845/reviews.php">XXX</a>, which promises to be the dumbest movie  since the last Steven Seagal movie.</p>

              <p>We watched <a href="http://www.k19movie.com/">K19: The Widowmaker</a> last night. It’s a true story about a Soviet nuclear submarine in 1961 that had problems with the nuclear reactor powering the sub on its maiden voyage intended to strike fear in the hearts of America with the Soviet’s nuclear power and strike potential.</p>

<p>It was intended to be very suspenseful, but it wasn’t. This was probably because we know that nothing nuclear happened in 1961 off the coast of the US so we assume that everything was resolved satisfactorily. Harrison Ford’s Russian accent was kinda weak and faded in and out at times and Liam Neeson’s Russian accent didn’t exist, making it even harder to believe. And, of course, there’s a lot of “Communists are cold and heartless people bent on the destruction of the US” rhetoric typical of Hollywood cold war movies.</p>

We have a caterpillar infestation! These things create nests in our trees, then crawl out and devour the leaves on the trees, not to mention crawling all over the driveway, patio, furniture, house, etc. Then they go and make coccoons where they morph into moths that are sure to make our summer nights miserable. Then the moths lay eggs to repeat the process ten-fold next year.</p>

<p>We don’t want this to happen. We’ve been spraying <a href="http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/2000/2174.html">B.t.</a> all over the trees to try to kill them. I think we are making some progress, but it’s not going to be a fun couple weeks.</p>

<p>Aside from this, the weather’s been great in Seattle. It even hit 91º on Friday. We spent almost the entire weekend outdoors doing yardwork. I even climbed up on the roof and vacuumed out the gutters with <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/05/001435.php">my new blower/vac</a>.</p>

 This tea is amazing! One night, my wife and I were trying to conceive our first love child, but to my astonishment (and my wifes) my penis would not become erect. This was so distressing for us, as we knew that a child was the only thing that would keep our marriage alive. I am gay, and my wife was on the brink of leaving me. We decided earlier that day that if a child was born between us, it would be enough to both prove my manhood and provide a my wife with something to play with (keeping her mind off my gay porn habit). In desperation, I turned to the internet looking for “Ginger” my favorite trans-gendered supermodel (formally known as Bobby). I performed a search on Google, and I accidently clicked on the wrong ‘ginger’. In tears, I decided to read this recipe, knowing that I had nothing else to do other than put a bullet in my head. It actually sounded good, I said to myself while sobbing! I remembered I had some ginger root in the fridge. The original purpose of the ginger was to make a soothing and spicy chest and nipple cream for my next date with Edward, the cute man from the gay strip club (I’ve been working on getting him in the sack for months!)…sorry for going on and on, I’ll get back to the point.</p>

<p>The ginger tea was made, and low and behold I had the most firm, lasting, and pleasant erection of my life! With the help of a gay porn mag and my wife on top, I had one incredible orgasm, and knew that this was the miracle we were searching for…our beutiful love child who we named Edward. My wife still has no idea why I insisted on Edward! : ) LOL, its my little secret, hehe. Now shush, and dont let it out, but make sure let out the word about this amazing miracle tea! I give it a 10!!_</p>

<p>Look the kid has imagination…we get about 1 or 2 doozies (sp?) like this a month – the internet version of a crank phone call I guess.  and if you are curious, this is <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/recipe/getrecipe.zsp?id=56108">the recipe</a></p>
