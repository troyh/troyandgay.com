            <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/apple.gif" alt="apple.gif" />Ok, we’re set. Apple will be showing the <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/wwdc03/">WWDC 2003 Keynote</a> online, albeit delayed. Watching Steve Jobs’ keynotes are some of the most interesting events in the computer industry. Bill Gates gets high marks for his keynotes too, but he’s just too stiff and never demos anything himself; he just hovers over an underling and asks softball questions. Steve Jobs is a master at it, though, and he never disappoints. He gets you interested, keeps you interested and makes you realize that the only exciting company in the industry is Apple. And I just love that he demos everything himself and does it so well.</p>

<p>Sounds like we can expect lots of OS X 10.3 Panther talk and even a new PowerMac G5 which uses the IBM PowerPC 970, a 64-bit CPU. Apple will, once again, leap-frog the industry by being the first to ship a 64-bit CPU to the masses. 64-bit CPUs aren’t going to be useful for a couple more years yet (it took at least 5 years for 32-bit CPUs to become the norm after they were available) but it’s nice to see it down the road.</p>

            <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/tux.gif" alt="tux.gif" />Linux + open source + Google=free fast tech support! Last night, the machine that runs this site seemed to die – I couldn’t ssh into it. Our machines are in downtown Seattle and this machine isn’t critical to anything, so I ignored it and went to bed. This morning, I called our hosting company and they looked at it and it appeared to be crashed. This is odd, because Linux never ever crashes (in 3 years of running 15 linux servers 24x7 I’ve seen 1 crash and it was due to a defective RAM chip). So they rebooted it for me.</p>

<p>I could get into it again, checked the logs, found the error that caused it to crash, searched for that text on Google and voilá, <a href="http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2002-085.html">I know what the problem is</a>. Total time: about 12 seconds. I could have it fixed even within the  hour if I felt like it was serious enough to worry about before the weekend.</p>

<p>If I didn’t use Linux, I’d spend hours just trying to figure out what the error message means exactly. And if the vendor didn’t have a fix available (if they deemed it important enough to fix, that is), I’d have to wait months or even years for a fix, if it ever came.</p>

            <p>We finally saw <a href="http://wilcofilm.com/">I’m Trying To Break Your Heart</a>, a movie about the making of <a href="http://www.wilcoworld.net/">Wilco</a>’s <a href="http://www.wilcoworld.net/records/yhf.html">Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</a> album. <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em> is my pick for 2002 album of the year. This album is especially notable because their record label dropped them after hearing the album calling it a “career-ending record” and claiming it was unmarketable. While trying to find a new label to distribute the record, they posted the album on their web site for free and it began to spread. After a year, a new label picked them up and it was released in April 2002. <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=2043926&amp;cf=">Rolling Stone</a> called it the “Album of the Year” and it’s widely-regarded as their best album to date.</p>

<p>It just goes to show that the people who control the music we listen to are clueless. And thanks to the Internet, good bands now have a way to get heard.</p>

<p>But the movie could have been better. It glossed over the rift that caused a member to be asked to leave. And it had more live footage of their shows than it did of studio time. I always find it fascinating to watch musicians create songs. The creative process – the sometimes haphazard decisions mixed with the careful thought – that goes into making great songs is fun to watch. But this movie lacked most of that. And it stopped right when the band got re-signed, rather than show the reaction of the fans and media to the album. I think that would have made a better film and made the truth about the recording industry’s misunderstanding of its own market more evident.</p>

            <p>The term “soap opera” came from Procter &amp; Gamble’s idea to create day-time television shows as vehicles to advertise cleaning products to women.</p>

<p>Also, the other day, I learned that Soft Cell’s <a href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~harel/cgi/page/htmlit?Tainted_Love.html">Tainted Love</a> is not an original song, it is a remake of <a href="http://www.coversproject.com/artist/Gloria%20Jones">Gloria Jones</a>’ <em>Tainted Love</em>.</p>
