          <p>Some good internet news… <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/19/technology/19popup.html">pop-ups may soon disappear</a>; <a href="http://recipezaar.com">we</a>‘ve given up lots of revenue by refusing pop-ups because we hate them so much, so I’m hopeful that we may be able to stop feeling like suckers (pop-up ads pay 10 to 35 times more than regular ads). And better still, [Yahoo has confirmed it will replace Google with its own search engine. Google’s good, but it’s got <em>way</em> too much power – it’ll be nice to have competition again.</p>

          <p>Look this is just plain fraud, and it is evil.  Luckily I know not to trust Paulinus_Pradip@bellsouth.net to be sending me mail on behalf of US Bank (or whomever sent me the one from Citibank last week complete with their logos), but other might not be as discerning:</p>

<p>Bastards.  Spam is one of our biggest problems.  I wish my email client had a way for me to push a button to sue these jerks.</p>
