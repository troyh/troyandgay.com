              <p><a href="http://www.newsforge.com/trends/04/03/11/0819219.shtml">BusinessWeek will be running a story</a> that refutes Microsoft’s claims that it had “no direct or indirect” dealings with SCO. SCO and Microsoft have both denied it. But Baystar, the middle-man venture firm who gave SCO $50 million, says that Microsoft executives did approach Baystar asking them to give SCO the money.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> BusinessWeek posted their <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2004/tc20040311_8915_tc119.htm">article</a>: <em>Lawrence Goldfarb, managing partner of BayStar, says that senior executives at the software giant had telephoned him about two months before the investment. Would he be interested in investing in SCO, they asked?</em></p>

<p>Why would Microsoft, a competitor to SCO, encourage an investment in a company with $20,000 in revenue last year and one clearly headed towards bankruptcy? Wouldn’t Microsoft prefer SCO go out of business? Or are they trying to keep the ridiculous anti-Linux lawsuits SCO has brought alive? I think the answer is obvious.</p>

<p><em>Will Americans hold U.S. policymakers accountable? Will we return to our roots as a republic, constrained and deliberate, respectful of others? My experience in the Pentagon leading up to the invasion and occupation of Iraq tells me, as Ben Franklin warned, we may have already failed. But if Americans at home are willing to fight – tenaciously and courageously – to preserve our republic, we might be able to keep it.</em></p>

              <p><a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2004/03/001929.php#001929">Troy and I disagree about “Capturing the Friedmans.”</a>  While the father, Arnold, was undoubtedly a pedophile, it is doubtful that he and the son Jesse should have been convicted on hundreds of counts of molestation when not a scrap of physical evidence was ever found.  The police, caught up in ‘80 mass child rape hysteria, told children they would end up gay if they didn’t agree to the detectives’ assertions of occurrences of sodomy.  Many of the children only “remembered” these (outrageous) incidents after Recovered Memory Hypnotherapy.
To me the movie was less about the tragedy of Jesse’s innocence – though I do agree with Troy the outline of the movie does not divulge Arnold’s guilt early enough – than the tragedy of seeing a family dissolve in real time with the family videos captured during the time of the trial.  There is a very haunting video journal scene that was never meant to make it to the big screen, and the honesty is scary.  The real tragedy is that (because of bad advice from lawyers and Arnold’s guilt) Arnold capsizes his whole family.  An effort to save Jesse, actually convicts him.  A mother vilified for not standing by her family, is simply honestly confused.  The children do not seem to understand that she has a different relationship with her husband (wife) which makes the situation more difficult for her.
I believe the film is ambiguous, and that is what is so interesting about it.  It was not just some bleeding-heart documentary filmmaker out to do justice (<a href="http://www.wm3.org">Free the West Memphis Three</a>), because wrongs were done on both sides.  This is the type of story you normally see in an independent film (fiction), the fact that it is true and you see original sources makes it all the more haunting.</p>
