            <p>Once again, <a href="http://www.andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2004_02_22_dish_archive.html#107768650195226154">Andrew Sullivan</a> has it right:</p>

<p><em>It’s the president who has to answer to the charge that in wartime, he chose to divide this country over the most profound symbol there can be: the Constitution itself. I refuse, in short, to be put in a position where I have to pick between a vital war and fundamental civil equality. The two are inextricable. They are the same war. And this time, the president has picked the wrong side. He will live to be ashamed that he did.</em></p>

            <p>Well, he finally did it. The President of the United States has officially <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A1883-2004Feb24?language=printer">endorsed discrimination</a>! Gay marriages aside, amending the U.S. Constitution to explicitly restrict personal freedoms and to codify religious ideals is everything the Constitution is against – it’s anti-American. George W. Bush is unfit to be an American. And to think there are Americans who criticize governments that push their views on their people. We are moving fast towards one of those types of governments. Sign the petition to <a href="http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=13773">protect the Constitution</a>.</p>

            <p>We went to dinner last night with our friends John &amp; Deborah. John and I always have interesting political discussions when we go down that road. It’s funny how two people who want the same goals have such different opinions on how to accomplish those goals. Who’s right? Probably both. In an election year with campaigns starting negative personal attacks, I wish more people would realize that neither side has evil intentions (grievous civil rights violations by the current administration aside).</p>

            <p>The M key on my iBook broke weeks ago. I emailed <a href="http://www.smalldog.com/">SmallDog</a> asking for a replacement key and they sent me one free-of-charge. Got it yesterday and my M key is as good as new. I love companies with great customer service.</p>
