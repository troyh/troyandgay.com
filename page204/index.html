              <p>Washington State is trying to get organized about marketing its beers.</p>

<blockquote>The crusade to establish Washington-made as a premium microbrew brand is in line for some help from the state Legislature, which appears willing to create a new industry promotional arm called the Washington Beer Commission.
&gt; 
&gt; If lawmakers give the OK, the commission will be officially empowered to levy a modest tax on its producers, put on fund-raising festivals and -- perhaps most important -- give away beer.
&gt; 
&gt; </blockquote>

<p>Washington does have great breweries, <a href="http://maritimebrewery.citysearch.com/">Maritime</a> and <a href="http://www.pikebrewing.com/">Pike Brewing Co</a> and even <a href="http://www.redhook.com/">Red Hook</a>, are great Seattle brewers and brewpubs like <a href="http://www.elysianbrewing.com/">Elysian</a> and <a href="http://www.bigtimebrewery.com/">Big Time</a> makes great beer too. But I have to admit, most of the beers I drink are from Oregon and California because they’re better. It’s heresy in Seattle to say this, but Seattle’s biggies, <a href="http://www.pyramidbrew.com/">Pyramid</a> and <a href="http://www.halesales.com/">Hale’s</a>, are not very good breweries, in my opinion – if your top beer is a Hefeweizen, it’s time to find a new brewmaster.</p>

<p>Maybe getting Washington beers noticed will help Washington State brewers to start making better beers when they realize they aren’t as good as <a href="http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/splash/default.aspx">Deschutes</a>, <a href="http://www.northcoastbrewing.com/">North Coast</a>, <a href="http://www.sierranevada.com/">Sierra Nevada</a>, etc.</p>

THE LAST DAY TO FILE CLAIMS IS MARCH 10, 2006</a></strong></p>

<p>I did attend Catholic school in Spokane.  I’m impressed they tracked me down.  The Catholic Diocese of Spokane is using Bankruptcy protection (don’t be fooled the Church is a corporation) to put a quick limit on the people who might come forward with sexual abuse charges, and conveniently, a corporation in bankruptcy protection does not have to suffer the embarrassment of damning testimony at trial.  <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002811879_webspokanesettlement17.html?syndication=rss">However, the strategy is backfiring.  The bankruptcy court has determined that all of the parishes are considered property of the Diocese</a>, that means they can be forced to sell the churches and everything in them to pay off the claims.</p>

<p>Godspeed to the claimants.</p>

<p>After the Seahawks and their fans pathetic whining about officiating, some (including Holmgren himself) accusing the refs of being paid off (!), they need to change “The 12th Man” to “The 12th Baby”. It wasn’t a ref that missed two field goals, that dropped four passes, that let Willie Parker run 75 yards for a touchdown and a Super Bowl record, that was completely fooled by a 43-yard reverse TD pass they admit to have been expecting, that couldn’t manage the clock at the end of the first half, that threw an interception at the 10-yard line, that let their QB get sacked twice at crucial times, etc.</p>
