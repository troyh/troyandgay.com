          <p>We got home from our mini-vacation in Vancouver yesterday. Ate lots of good food while we were there, including <a href="http://www.evevancouver.ca/food/kitsilano.htm#Maria's">the best Greek food</a> I’ve had in 8 years. Seattle is terrible for Greek food and it’s one thing I really miss from Washington, DC.</p>

<p>One thing that surprised me about Vancouver is the beer selection. Most restaurants have local beers, but none were that good. I ended up just having Stella Artois (Belgian beer in British Columbia; why not British beer?!) most of the time. Although we went to a couple brewpubs for good beer, <a href="http://www.steamworks.com/">Steamworks</a> had the best beer and good pizza (but terrible terrible service at lunch time).</p>

          <p>Richard Clarke makes serious allegations about the quality of our national security during the 9/11 hearings and the Bush Administration’s responses have all been to attack the person, not his assertions. And Condoleezza Rice goes on TV to criticize Clarke, but refuses to testify before the committee. We’re looking for the truth so we can protect the US in the future. You’re either with us or against us, Mr. Bush.</p>

          <p>We’ve been listening to and watching the 9/11 hearings going on in Washington this week. Maybe I’m getting old, but it’s very uncomfortable for me to listen to these people talk about killing people as if it’s nothing. Granted, they’re talking about killing people who want to kill people, but nevertheless…</p>

<p>I am simply bewildered that Condoleeza Rice is not testifying. Why?!</p>

<p>I think the Clinton Administration should have invaded Afghanistan in 1996 when Bin Laden <a href="http://www.vitrade.com/sudan_risk/laden/laden_declaration_of_war.htm">declared war on the US</a>.</p>

<p>I’m in Canada for a few days. Canadians like to point out that they are much more aware of world news than Americans. So I thought it was funny when we were in a pub yesterday and CNN was on one of the televisions talking about bombings in Baghdad. The other 5 televisions in the place were showing hockey games. The Canadian customers asked to change the CNN television that was showing “Breaking News” to another hockey game. :)</p>
