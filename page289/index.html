        <article>
          <p>We’ve been listening to and watching the 9/11 hearings going on in Washington this week. Maybe I’m getting old, but it’s very uncomfortable for me to listen to these people talk about killing people as if it’s nothing. Granted, they’re talking about killing people who want to kill people, but nevertheless…</p>

<p>I am simply bewildered that Condoleeza Rice is not testifying. Why?!</p>

<p>I think the Clinton Administration should have invaded Afghanistan in 1996 when Bin Laden <a href="http://www.vitrade.com/sudan_risk/laden/laden_declaration_of_war.htm">declared war on the US</a>.</p>

<p>I’m in Canada for a few days. Canadians like to point out that they are much more aware of world news than Americans. So I thought it was funny when we were in a pub yesterday and CNN was on one of the televisions talking about bombings in Baghdad. The other 5 televisions in the place were showing hockey games. The Canadian customers asked to change the CNN television that was showing “Breaking News” to another hockey game. :)</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2004/03/001947.php#001947">Just like yesterday’s ARIA announcement</a>, independent music stores say that file-sharing is not hurting business either: <em>“The file sharing, the Internet – just makes them music junkies,” Wiley said.</em></p>

          <p>The ARIA, the Australian equivalent of the RIAA, <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/03/18/1079199330947.html">reports</a> that music sales are up to an all-time high, profits are up and prices are down. The industry is prospering and consumers are paying less. Who’s the loser in the file-sharing era? CD single sales are down, which is good, because those things are a rip-off anyway and singles (really just advertisements) should be downloaded for free.</p>

<p>Speaking of this, I bought 3 Pepsis yesterday since the <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/pepsi/">iTunes giveaway</a> promises 1 in 3 will win. I opened the first one and I’m a winner! And it seems that Pepsi fixed the <a href="http://www.macmerc.com/news/archives/1270">cheat</a>, because I couldn’t tell in the store which ones were winners.</p>
