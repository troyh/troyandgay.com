          <p>The Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against the bailout plan, crying “Whaaaa… Pelosi said things about de-regulation… whaa whaa”, and the stock market fell 8%. Fine, it’s not a perfect plan. But why don’t they suggest a new plan or suggest changes? Instead, they just go home until Thursday. Selfish and stupid.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>I read this week’s The Economist that had several articles on the bailout and related topics and here’s my updated understanding and explanation for the bailout problem and cure. In the end, The Economist thinks this plan is as good as any plan and is simple, so they believe it should be passed. Read “The Economist’s article”:http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12305746 or read my summarized version…</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>My understanding of CDSs was not accurate. They aren’t simply fake securities, they’re insurance against the risk of bad loans (defaults on credit, or “credit-defaults”). It still seems a dubious idea to me to create a risk assesment (CDS) on top of a risk assessment (a loan). But those are the types of things that financial people create. Ultimately, they’re fine as long as the risks are correctly gauged. In this case, they clearly weren’t. The rest of my explanation seems to be accurate. Amazing.</p>

<p>As for my alternative options, <em>The Economist</em> only addressed one: have the government buy all or part of the banks. The Economist explains why that wasn’t chosen:</p>

<p>bq. But banks might not volunteer to sell equity to the government before they reach death’s door; and the prospect of share dilution could discourage private investors.</p>

<p>I’m not convinced. Banks that don’t sell equity to the government would go bankrupt and the ones that don’t would stay afloat. That’s good enough to save the credit problem. We only need two banks to take up the government’s offer. If they all refuse, the government could force some to do it. But the article goes on to say:</p>

<p>bq. In any event, the Treasury plan could be flexible enough to permit such capital injections.</p>

<p>So if banks want to sell equity and the Treasury decides they want to buy, they can. Basically, the plan says the Treasury gets the $700 billion and can do whatever it wants with the money.</p>

<p>Apparently, no one seriously considered my first option: to buy the bad mortgages and restructure them. That’s probably too much work and wouldn’t solve the problem the government is really concerned with: the inability for banks to make new loans.</p>

<p>Will it work? No one knows. But it seems to be clear that this should stop the near-term catastrophe in the banking industry. There’s no reason to believe that it will solve all the problems in our economy. The core problem is that the housing bubble has burst and it’ll take years for that to reach the level it was.</p>

<p>People who oppose the entire notion of a bail-out have been asking “Shouldn’t we just let Wall Street fail?”. The answer is no because we are the ones that would be suffering from the consequences. Like it or not, Wall Street is important to our economy. It’s true that the “fat cats” on Wall Street make a lot of money, but they perform an important job that makes our economy work. To those who think it’s such an easy job for such high pay, then they should go do the job themselves and earn the money. The truth is that it’s not an easy job and there are few people who can do it (which is why they’re paid so well). They screwed up this time, but on the whole, Wall Street works pretty well and they are a big reason our economy has been such a juggernaut for 100+ years.</p>

<p>If the only reason not to do something to is a question of morality, i.e., not rewarding the “fat cats” for their failure, then we’re very likely dooming ourselves to several years of a very bad economy. Morality is important, of course, but as the song says, “no one needs morality when there isn’t enough to eat”:http://www.musicsonglyrics.com/N/newmodelarmylyrics/newmodelarmythechargelyrics.htm. And given that the “FBI is now investigating”:http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/23/AR2008092302673.html this mess for fraud, some people may get their punishment.</p>

<p>Besides, we’re not rewarding the people who caused the problem, we’re rewarding those people who can <em>fix</em> the problem. If you can go to Wall Street and fix it, you’d be paid well to do it too.</p>

<p>Why $700 billion? Currently, 4.5% of all mortgages are in default by three months. That amounts to $500 billion in mortgages. Over the next few months, as our economy remains weak, the number of mortgages that default will surely increase. The extra $200 billion is a cushion. <em>The Economist</em> is optimistic that they’ll spend less:</p>

<p>bq. The true cost to taxpayers is unlikely to be anywhere near $700 billion, because many of the acquired mortgages will be repaid.</p>

<p>We’ll see.</p>

          <p>Wow. From “the LA Times”:http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-palinreligion28-2008sep28,0,3643718.story?track=rss:</p>

<p>bq. Palin told him that “dinosaurs and humans walked the Earth at the same time,” Munger said.</p>

<p>She must get her history from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_the_Lost_(1974_TV_series)">Land of the Lost</a>. Now someone <em>has</em> to ask her if the world is flat and if the Sun revolves around the Earth. Oh what the hell, ask her if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_%2B_two_%3D_five">2+2=5</a>.</p>

<p>There’s a good chance she could be President of the most powerful country in the world and she doesn’t understand simple facts. This is the person Republicans think is their second-best. Imagine who they think is third!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I’m told that this belief about dinosaurs and humans co-existing is a trap that Evangelicals have found themselves in because they made the mistake of proclaiming that the book of Genesis is literal, i.e., that God created everything in 6 days. So the fact that dinosaurs lived for hundreds of millions of years, not the 5,000 that humans have existed, has to be explained away. Dinosaurs lived for a weekend, I guess, before God decided he screwed up or that he hated them and got rid of them… by the Ice Age… without killing any humans. I wonder if they think that God created and killed dinosaurs, had humans bury them thousands of feet into the Earth so we could power our cars with it and fight over it.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>My armchair economist analysis of the bailout says that it’s a bad idea. To think this out, I’m going to write my understanding of the problem and see if I can figure out whether the bailout makes sense or not. Bear in mind that I’m really stupid so this could all be wrong (else I got lucky). Most of what I write on this blog is for my own use, now and in the future. I put it out there for my own benefit, not yours. ;)  If you get something useful out of it, great. If not, you were warned.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>As I understand the problem, companies in the financial industry (Lehman Brothers, Bear Sterns and, I bet, lots of other biggies) as well as companies not in the financial sector (only AIG that we know of, but I suspect many others) took out loans using mortgages that they bought as collateral for the loans. They bought “<em>Credit Default Swaps</em>“:http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp (CDSs) with the money they borrowed. CDSs were essentially virtual securities. The investment banks created them out of thin air, Enron-style, and they all agreed that they had value. Then they decided that they had even more value. That value went up, up, up. Apparently, the value of all CDSs was higher than the combined GDP of every country in the world! It doesn’t take a rocket scientist, and certainly shouldn’t take an investment banker either, to understand that this makes no sense. Nothing can be worth more than what <em>everyone</em> can afford to pay for it.</p>

<p>Reality wasn’t enough to make CDSs implode because, it turns out, “no one really understood what a CDS was”:http://www.economicpopulist.org/?q=content/derivatives-investment-vehicles-no-one-understands. They had value because everyone else believed they had value. And the SEC and investors didn’t know they existed because they were outside the regulatory laws so no one could tell that the financial industry was living in a fantasy. The stocks of the financial companies went up, up, up because they owned CDSs whose values went up, up, up. Again, it’s Enron all over again except that Enron was not the underpinning of our entire economy the way the financial industry is. The financial industry is the oil in our economic machine.</p>

<p>What made the financial industry realize CDSs were worthless was the mortgage industry’s collapse that “started in 2005”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis. The mortgage industry cratered because of all the mortgages that were made in the late 1990s and early 2000s couldn’t be paid. Thanks to very low interest rates, everyone wanted to buy a house and everyone else wanted to give them a mortgage. That wasn’t enough mortgages so the sub-prime mortgage, a mortgage at an even lower interest rate that was below the prime rate, became fashionable. It used to be that the mortgage industry had to verify and prove that the person getting the mortgage had a good chance of paying it back. That’s in their self-interest, of course. But they can also sell that loan to someone else. That’s not a problem because no one is foolish enough to buy a bad loan. Again thanks to de-regulation, banks no longer had to provide the details about the loan to the buyer of the loan, so the buyer didn’t know they were buying a risky loan. This worked out pretty well for banks. They could collect mortgage fees and not carry the risk. With the housing bubble and all the mortgages that were being done, these fees amounted to big money.</p>

<p>Homeowners became unable to pay their mortgages because these loans were written “creatively”, which is a euphemism for “illogical”. They used Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs) and even stranger payback schedules so that the math worked out so that people with not enough money could buy expensive houses. Then interest rates started going up again and so did the mortgage payments. People couldn’t pay. Obviously, when the owners of the loans realized that they bought loans that weren’t going to be paid back, the loans became worthless and banks had to start writing them off as losses. Over and over and over again. Boom, the mortgage industry fell apart. Washington Mutual, the #1 mortgage lender, just “went belly-up”:http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aMDDN2oMLQus&amp;refer=home. I’m sure there are more to come. I’m glad about Washington Mutual going away, I hated that it was called “WaMu”. Living in Seattle, everyone talked about “Whaamoo this”, “Whaamoo that”. Ugh.</p>

<p>On a side note, there are people who blame the people who bought houses. That’s true to some extent. Who wouldn’t take out a sweet mortgage if they were approved for one? That’s how everything works in our economy: if someone wants to sell me a Ferrari for $1.50 I’ll buy it, it’s not my job to make sure the seller’s business is sound. Why should new homeowners have to make sure that the bank giving them a mortgage is not being stupid? Granted, the new homeowner should have understood the math to realize that they’re not going to be able to pay the loan back when the interest rate increases. It’s their fault they’re losing their home, but it’s not their fault the mortgage industry collapsed. (Note: if you want to sell me a Ferrari, I may go as high as $2.50).</p>

<p>Now the Federal Government comes to save the day by buying these bad loans. That saves the people who made the risky bets on top of bad loans because their bad loans, which aren’t worth much, are being exchanged for dollars, which are worth something (we hope!). But now the tax-payers own a lot of bad loans. Why would <em>we</em> want them?! The government says that these are mortgages and, since real estate is a good investment, the mortgages will eventually be worth something and the government can earn a profit later either by selling the loans to the private sector or, since we officially own Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, will earn the interest on the mortgages. All the profits will be passed back to the tax-payer. But will there be profits? These loans are mostly likely to default, which is why we’re in this mess in the first place, right?</p>

<p>I don’t get it. I realize that we have to do <em>something</em>. The economic machine needs oil or it grinds to a halt and we all suffer – companies go bankrupt and new businesses can’t be created, unemployment increases, people can’t buy widgets, widget companies go bankrupt, unemployment rises, people can’t buy food, food companies go bankrupt, unemployment rises, we can’t afford to buy beer, beer companies go bankrupt and then we all move into caves and hit each other with clubs.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the government has other options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Buy the bad mortgages, re-evaluate them all with the now low values of homes and, if the homeowners can afford the newly-written mortgage, they can keep their house. People remain homeowners, they have a valuable asset and a mortgage that makes sense for the value of their house, they start feeling good about their financial situation, they start to spend money and the economy starts spinning up again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Forget the loans and buy all or part of the banks that have these loans. This keeps the banks afloat and makes them solvent <em>and</em> liquid again. People can borrow money again and the economy starts spinning up again. People still lose their houses, but the only people who seem to care about that are the people who are losing their houses (who says Americans are empathetic?). And because the banks were on the verge of bankruptcy, they’re cheap, which makes it more likely that their value, and tax-payers’ value, goes up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some combination of those two.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Both of these solutions are “hand-outs” (to individual people or to banks), but that’s what the government is for, especially if it makes the entire country better-off. And the government is far more likely to profit when the mortgages are paid back and/or the banks do well. Others say this is the dreaded socialism, but those people are free market idealists who haven’t yet realized that the free market isn’t the answer to every problem.</p>

<p>Now I’m going to go read what <em>The Economist</em> says about it and see if I change my mind or learn something…</p>
