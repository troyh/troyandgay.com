              <p>This was a surprise. Gay found it our grocery store and thought of me. It’s a Belgian Stout (I’ve never heard of such a thing) made with Belgian chocolate. It’s not as cake-like as Old Rasputin or Stone’s “Russian Imperial”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/07/03/stone-imperial-russian-stout/ and it’s very slightly sour, but has a nice chocolate flavor and a slight bitterness. I could drink several of these in a row, which is not usually true for me and stouts.</p>

<p>“Official site”:http://www.ommegang.com/index.php?mcat=1&amp;scat=7&amp;ssnl=1. It’s only rated a “B+ on BeerAdvocate”:http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/42/38818 and a “3.6 on RateBeer”:http://ratebeer.com/beer/ommegang-chocolate-indulgence/75815/. I’d give it an A- and at least a 4.0.</p>

              <p>The WSJ has “a good article on real estate prices”:http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122764977315457619.html and includes three gems that show how Americans make bad decisions when investing:</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>bq. In a poll of 2,000 adults, real-estate-data provider Zillow.com found that 61% believed the value of their home would either remain level or rise over the next six months.</p>

<p>6 months! Americans are nothing if not optimistic. Housing prices have fallen every year for the last few years, 10% in the last year alone. But 61% of those surveyed believe that the next 6 months will reverse all of that. What are they thinking will ignite a surge in home prices? Houses, like all things, are priced by supply and demand. Right now, there is excess supply and very little demand so prices will continue to fall until they reach a point where they are so low that demand picks up. That’s not likely to happen by May 2009.</p>

<p>bq. Another survey of more than 1,000 homeowners, sponsored by real-estate-services firm Realogy Corp., found that 91% thought that owning a home was the best long-term investment they could make.</p>

<p>Real estate values are not great investments, especially not long-term investments. A house is a wise purchase because you have to have a roof over your head and putting money into something that you own and can even grow and beat inflation is better than throwing it away in rent. Plus, the tax breaks make owning even cheaper. Real estate is relatively safe, but not a great investment (and not without risk).</p>

<p>bq. And an online survey of 5,000 people commissioned by Citigroup found that just 32% believed it was a good time to invest in stocks – but 51% said it was a good time to buy a home.</p>

<p>Stocks are still the best long-term investment. Real estate barely beats inflation (2.5%) but stocks average 10% or more per year. People don’t believe that because they invest emotionally. People seem to think that buying stock when the prices are low is dumb, yet they flock to Wal-mart to get low prices on everything but their investments. Do people think that if you buy stock in a bear market that they’re getting lower-quality stock that is less likely to rise? It’s very weird.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>John Markoff writes about an “ex-Microsoft employee who has written a book”:http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/01/a-microsoft-veteran-embraces-open-source/ about open source, what most Microsoft employees consider more evil than Satan, why it’s the future of software and why Microsoft is “toast”.  That’s hardly news.</p>

<p>bq. Ultimately, he left because he was bored: “The amount I learned in my 11th year was much less than what I had learned in my first year, and the stock had become stagnant.”</p>

<p>It took him 11 years to get bored. I’m impressed… I was bored after two.</p>

<p>My three cents on open source and free (as in free beer and freedom) software….</p>

<p>1¢: Low-level software (operating systems, developer tools and even word processors) will become commoditized. Those are three things Microsoft makes a ton of money on right now, but in the end, they will be commodities and businesses will be built on top of them, businesses that sell them will be obsolete.</p>

<p>2¢: Open Source makes sense in a capitalist system in that it’s cheaper for corporations to use and even maintain open source software than it is to pay one vendor millions or tens of millions of dollars for something they have no control over and can’t provide you with a competitive advantage. Rather than pay Microsoft $10 million/year for Windows licenses, a Fortune 500 corporation can pay $500K/year three developers to maintain Linux, knowing that all the other Fortune 500 companies are doing the same. They’ll get a better product, a better response time to fixing bugs and very likely lower their maintenance costs because the inner workings aren’t a secret. Once the network effect takes hold around on Linux, if it already hasn’t, a company selling an operating system is on the decline.</p>

<p>3¢: Proprietary software companies can survive if they make a better and easier-to-use product. But the rule of “good enough” is hard to compete against. Windows is not better or easier-to-use than a Mac, but it’s “good enough”. Linux is better (faster, more reliable) but not easier-to-use than Windows… but eventually it will be good enough.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>The NYT writes about “the annual Black Friday insanity”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/29/business/29black.html?_r=1&amp;hp:</p>

<p>bq. A 34-year-old Wal-Mart employee was killed, the police said, after being knocked down and trampled by a wave of shoppers who broke down the doors of the store at the Green Acres Mall in Valley Stream, N.Y. Several other shoppers were hurt, including a 28-year-old pregnant woman who was taken to the hospital, police said, after the stampede occurred just after 5 a.m.</p>

<p>In lighter news, there’s plenty of stupid people:</p>

<p>bq. “I’ve been doing this for 17 years; this year, it feels smaller,” said Tracey Darwish, 37, who was waiting in line at the Wal-Mart in Columbus to buy Madden ‘09, the football video game for PlayStation 2, for $39, marked down from $59. Ms. Darwish said that in the past she would “spend thousands of dollars on Black Friday” – even withdrawing money from her retirement account.</p>

<p>She waited in line for Wal-Mart to open to buy Madden ‘09 for $39. Yet anyone can go to Amazon and buy it “for $39.99”:http://www.amazon.com/Madden-NFL-09-Playstation-2/dp/B0012N40A0/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1227895680&amp;sr=8-2. But even dumber, she takes money out of her retirement account to buy Christmas gifts. What an idiot.</p>

<p>This woman is “cutting back” by buying an electronic corkscrew, because when times are tough and you’re unemployed, opening a bottle of wine can be unbearable with the non-electronic corkscrews:</p>

<p>bq. Rosemary O’Brien, 55, of Newport, R.I., glanced over the selection of silver-wrapped electronic corkscrews at Bloomingdale’s, retailing for $39.99. She said that she was trying to cut back after her business, Freedom Yachts, recently closed.</p>

<p>And she’s betting on not having to pay the bill:</p>

<p>bq. “I am paying a lot with credit cards, and I’m hoping the banks go out of business and I won’t have to pay them back,” Ms. O’Brien said.</p>

<p>In other words, she’s hoping that <em>all</em> banks go out of business, not just her bank. And Americans wonder why they’re all in debt and can’t get ahead.</p>
