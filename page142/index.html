          <p>Bristol Palin’s baby dadda, Levi Johnston, “corrects the stories about him”:http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/P/PALIN_WASILLA_HEARTTHROB?SITE=CTDAN&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT:</p>

<p>bq. The baby is due Dec. 18. Johnston has dropped out of high school to take a job on the North Slope oil fields as an apprentice electrician.</p>

<p>Good idea! A high school education will only stand in your way of earning a good living to support your baby. Always think about today because tomorrow may never come. And what better place to learn to be an electrician than an oil field? Levi Johnston is a wise kid man. Stupid me, I learned to be a software developer at a software development company… I should have learned computer science at a textile mill.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>bq. For starters, he said his much-maligned MySpace page was a joke - the one that claimed he said: “I’m a … redneck,” and “I don’t want kids.” Johnston said his friends created the page a few years ago and he had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>Sure they did. What friends wouldn’t spend their time making up a MySpace page for you that has such hilarious jokes like “I don’t want kids”? That’s what makes it so funny – high school kids making friendly jabs at their friends like saying they don’t want kids. It’s funny because everyone knows high school kids, especially boys, are all about babies. It’s really all they think about… that and their fairy tale wedding. Clearly, Levi isn’t a redneck either, far from it! It’s just another clever joke by his friends.</p>

<p>bq. Johnston said he has dated Palin since his freshman year in high school. “We were planning on getting married a long time ago with or without the kid,” he said. “That was the plan from the start.”</p>

<p>I’m sure. All 9th-graders are thinking marriage. And 10th-graders spend a great deal of time thinking about retirement. That’s just what high school kids do.</p>

<p>bq. [A friend] doesn’t think anyone pressured Johnston into marriage. “If he thought it wasn’t the right thing to do he probably wouldn’t do it,” he said.</p>

<p>Just like he thinks dropping out of high school is the right thing to do. I mean, he <em>probably</em> wouldn’t do it if it wasn’t the right thing to do.</p>

          <p>Exactly one year after the stock market peak on Oct 12, 2007, <a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?chdnp=0&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=1&amp;chdet=1223669600635&amp;chddm=98532&amp;q=INDEXSP:.INX&amp;ntsp=0">it’s down more than 42%</a>:</p>

<p>I predict it’ll drop at least another 10% before it comes back. But if you want to double your money in a year or two, invest now.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is only down 9.88% <a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?chdnp=0&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=1&amp;chdet=1223670666980&amp;chddm=98923&amp;q=NYSE:BRK.A&amp;ntsp=0">in the same period</a>:</p>

          <p>Just like “I wondered about”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/09/27/the-bailout/ a couple weeks ago, Paulson is “considering investing in banks”:http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122355427239518855.html. This is a lot less risky than buying bad loans, so it is much better for the tax-payers. Hopefully, as an investor in banks, tax-payers can throw out the executives who are clearly not competent enough to run the banks. But I doubt it.</p>

          <p>The Palinistas are now convinced that Obama is a terrorist because their Lord Sarah said so. Not the CIA or any intelligence agency in the world, not even John McCain says that. But Sarah, someone who can’t put coherent sentences together, knows something the rest of the world doesn’t. Watch Mindy Green explain that terrorism is “in his blood lines”:</p>

<p>Stupidity is in Mindy Green’s blood lines.</p>
