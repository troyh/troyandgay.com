          <p>Monday morning we were back on I-90 heading home:</p>

<p>Havana enjoys a good book and a snack:</p>

<p>And I survived another trip to Spokane:</p>

          <p>The Connolly’s had a brunch on Sunday where Havana had one of her few exposures to a ton of kids:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2730594606/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3266/2730594606_21bb93e7e1.jpg" alt="Havana at Connolly's play room" /></a></p>

<p>She held onto her doll and seemed shocked by all the activity. Frankly, it was a bit too much for me as well. Note to self: stop short of 12 kids.</p>

<p>After brunch, we drove out to Grandma’s farm where Havana met some animals:</p>

          <p>The “Dry Fly Distillery”:http://dryflydistilling.com/ is the only distillery in Washington State. They’ve been in business a year and we visited and got a tour from the co-owner. They make vodka and gin right now and will be coming out with a whiskey later this year and a bourbon next year. Most gins are made with juniper berries and maybe one more ingredient, they put several spices in their gin, including hops. Everything they use is grown in Washington State.</p>

<p>I even got to bottle some gin and put the labels on it:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2730592220/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3252/2730592220_ce2e3167b1.jpg" alt="IMG_3685.JPG" /></a></p>

<p>Because I did such a great job bottling, they gave me a free t-shirt. We bought a bottle of gin and vodka and will try a martini as soon as we get home.</p>

          <p>Another day, another brewpub for lunch. I was shocked to find out that Spokane had, not one, but two brewpubs. This time we went to <a href="http://www.washingtonbrewersguild.org/members_nlights.php">Northern Lights Brewing</a>. The beer here was much better than Steam Plant’s beers. I liked almost all of their beers:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2735845492/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2072/2735845492_0ae4a56b4a.jpg" alt="Sample of all beers at Northern Lights Brewing" /></a></p>

<p>The food was much better too.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, Dry Fly Distillery was right next door. Gay had read about Dry Fly months ago and we made a mental note to visit it the next time we were in Spokane. So <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/02/dry-fly-distillery/">we went</a>.</p>
