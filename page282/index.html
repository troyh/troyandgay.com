              <p>Since I last wrote, the Tour has regained its excitement (too exciting to write about it!). Lance has decimated his rivals. He’s got over 4 minutes and it isn’t even Ullrich that is #2, but Ullrich’s teammate. It was as great as ever watching Lance charge up the mountains and watching his rivals fail to hold his wheel. Seeing that is one of the greatest things in sport, IMO. And his team ran a perfect race the entire time. This has got to be the easiest Tour win yet for Lance. 7 maybe??!</p>

              <p>Who has time for cold feet, when you are running around so fast?  We picked up Troy’s suit today – would you believe the bride’s dress cost a small fraction of his outfit?  The flowers are set, the menu is set (pig AND salmon roast, both whole), the wine is ordered, the rehearsal dinner band secured…frankly, I’m very very exited.  Oddly, the port-a-potties were delivered two weeks early today while we were out.  It is rather un-Vashon-like for <em>anything</em> to happen ahead of time, and they are a strange yard sculpture, to say the least.  Perhaps our neighbors will use these instead of our woods – but that is another blog entry altogether.</p>

<p>Mostly, I can’t wait.</p>

<p>I feel like I have attended so many weddings, but never realized what they were really about until now.  Not only is it a tremendous amount of effort, detail, stress, family, money, insomnia, etc., but it is a very big deal for two people.  I apologize to all the friends whose weddings I attended and didn’t really take very seriously during my single-girl bitterness.  Like children (which I still don’t get), weddings are something I think you don’t really understand until you do it yourself.</p>

              <p>The <a href="http://www.letour.fr/">Tour</a> started more exciting than most, with a team time-trial so early, but it’s been boring since the first few days. This weekend should see some interesting stages. But <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/529597.html">Samuel Abt</a> thinks the excitement will come next week. But I just don’t see how Lance can lose this year, unless he screws up. Ullrich just doesn’t look that strong and is already farther behind than he should be at this point. Iban Mayo is out, of course. Whodathunkit that the 6th victory would be so easy?</p>
