<p>The trucks were to arrive this morning to <a href="http://optimismbrewing.com/news/4589f80e314a4a15e2568729ce6af0e87e3ac685">deliver all the brewing equipment</a>. My phone rang at 7am and I was greeted to a gruff truck driver asking for directions and dropping the f-bomb unnecessarily. Gay and I got to the brewery at 8 or so while they were finishing unloading that first truck. The other truck drivers were much more friendly.</p>

<p>After dropping the big kids off at school, Gerene brought Eva by the brewery to check it out. She likes climbing up to the mezzanine and found some sawdust to play with.</p>

<p>Our friend Steve, who works across the street at the Polyclinic, also stopped by to check out the activity and get a tour of the building.</p>

<p>It was a long day. Gay and I, but mostly Gay, spent the day as a flagger holding a Stop sign to block the street for the trucks. We had a great lunch at the new <a href="http://meatandbread.ca/capitol-hill/todays-menu/">Meat &amp; Bread</a> practically next door. By the afternoon, I was bored and volunteered to remove the protective wrap from the tanks while the guys moved all the tanks in. </p>

<p>Hudson’s first game of the spring season was today. I think the score was 9-3, Hudson says 11-2. Either way, I sense another undefeated season.</p>

<p>Gay’s mom, and my favorite mother-in-law, is in town this week. She likes to have a fancy dinner when she comes to Seattle so we made reservations at the Space Needle restaurant. She was last at the Space Needle during the <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_21_Exposition">World’s Fair in 1962,</a> which it was built for. It’s a work-of-art, it still looks modern and futuristic 52 years later! The kids have never been there. I think I was last there in 1997. </p>

<p>I don’t like touristy stuff but it was a lot of fun, it didn’t feel very touristy. The restaurant revolves a full turn every 45 minutes, which the kids thought was super-cool, so the view is constantly changing and it’s a view of Seattle you don’t see often. We live in a beautiful city, I never tire of seeing the mountains, water, architecture, greenery, etc. </p>

<p>After dinner, we went to the observation deck which has these cool touch screens that show a 360° view and let you go to any date and time and even watch time-lapse videos: </p>

<p>(Even more impressive, it was made by Microsoft!)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.empmuseum.org">EMP Museum</a> is near the Space Needle:</p>

<p><img src="/img/IMG_5417.JPG" alt="Title" /></p>

<p>I’ve always thought that the EMP, despite being designed by <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gehry">Frank Gehry</a>, is an eyesore from a distance, so much that I’ve avoided ever going to it. But up close it looks great. One day I’ll have to go. </p>
