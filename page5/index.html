          <p>It was one of the most exciting first weeks of a Tour, but once Froome and Contador crashed out and abandoned, the winner was all but set and it became a race for 2nd place. And Americans Talansky and (Tacoma, WA native) Van Garderen had tough races, although finishing 5th is still good. But I’m sad to see it over nevertheless. </p>

<p>Nibali was a great winner, attacking even with a commanding lead already. It was an impressive victory and Nibali is one of only 6 people to win all 3 Grand Tours. Hard to believe his coach <a href="http://www.cyclingquotes.com/news/vinokourov_criticizes_nibali_in_internal_letter/">wrote him a letter this year</a> telling him he’s disappointed.</p>

          <p>The most philosophical sports interview I’ve ever heard:</p>

<blockquote>Previously, I was scared to try something because I was always scared of failure. Once you believe and aren't scared of the outcome, things become a lot clearer and opportunities arise. </blockquote>

<p>—Michael Rogers, 34, Stage 16 winner in the 2014 Tour de France, his first career TdF win of his career</p>

<p>Most of these interviews with stage winners are about what happened on the road, team tactics, etc.</p>

          <p>C&amp;G&amp;H wrote about our logo again for <a href="http://www.printmag.com/branding/identify/start-up-right/">Print magazine</a>. Apparently, Gay and I are “unusual”, which I think is a compliment. I like that they mention the unofficial 5th ingredient in beer: carbonation.</p>
