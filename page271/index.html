        <article>
          <p>Lots of Google news today… tomorrow “will bring”:http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3394401 their long-awaited and now famous Dutch auction IPO. And for such a well-run company (apparently), they’ve been doing a terrible job with their IPO; first an investigation in an illegal issuing of shares and now they’re being investigated by the SEC for violating the “quiet period” by “granting an interview”:http://news.com.com/Google+revealed+in+Playboy+interview%3F/2100-1038_3-5307955.html?part=rss&amp;tag=5307955&amp;subj=news.1038.5 to Playboy. I just can’t understand why this company is thought to be so valuable. They’re profitable (or so they say) and their search engine doesn’t suck (well, it does, but nobody quite realizes it yet), their Gmail service is not any more interesting than anyone else’s, and to top it all off, they’re really an ad agency. Our favorite ad agency, honestly, but an ad agency nonetheless.</p>

        <article>
          <p><img src="http://images.apple.com/airportexpress/images/airtunescables06072004.gif" alt="Airport Express" /> We also got “Airport Express”:http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/ days before the wedding. Good thing, because we ended up having to put the amplifier upstairs so we could control the music via a laptop downstairs.</p>

<p>Overall, Airport Express is good, but there were some problems. For one, it was the most difficult install I’ve ever done with an Apple product. I figured I would just plug it into the wall, plug in the ethernet and the audio cable and I’d be done. Apple is so good, this is what I expected. But I actually had to install some software from the CD that came with it. Ugh! The software is a configuration utility for the Airport Express; and then I had to download iTunes 4.6 to get AirTunes. I know Windows users are thinking “So? I have to install several things, reboot 4 times and talk to tech support for 90 minutes whenever I get new hardware. And I’m lucky if I don’t have to reinstall Windows or get 37 Windows Updates that don’t work.” But for an Apple product, this was painful – it took me almost 15 minutes to get it working.</p>

<p>But the most signficant problem with it is that it just cuts out often. Simon Willison has “noticed the same problem”:http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/08/03/airport. It worked great for a couple days before the wedding, but of course, the day of the wedding it started to do this. I thought our 2.4GHz phone was interfering with the WiFi, especially when neighbors were calling (at 10pm!) about the music. But I guess it’s just a bug.</p>

<p>What I did learn that just amazed me is that I could get a reliable WiFi connection at the end of our front yard, a good 200 yards from the house. Several months ago we got a “Linksys WRT54G”:http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?prid=508&amp;scid=35, an 802.11g base station, and the range is far greater than our older 802.11b Linksys. We were streaming MP3s from the house to the front yard to play during the ceremony. I wonder if all our neighbors have learned they can have free internet access off our WiFi base stations. :)</p>
