          <p>Troy and I joked about starting an internet porn business instead of recipes, just because it was such a clear money-maker.  If only we’d realized there was a great business just a couple of doors down: online personal ads/dating.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/29/national/29DATE.html">This article in the NYTimes</a> (free registration required) talks about how mainstream it has become.  While Match.com makes $240,000,000/year (!) and clearly network effects matter (like ebay you go to the site that has the most people on it, so the bigger you get the bigger you get), in the case of dating they key is finding other people like you so there is plenty of room for niche sites like JDate.com for Jewish Singles, etc.</p>

          <p>Rush Limbaugh, apparently angry that Al Gore is on the Apple board, <a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_062703/content/across_the_fruited_plain.guest.html">explains</a> that Apple hasn’t doubled its marketshare because of internal politics. Crazy logic.</p>

          <p>Wal-Mart is responsible for getting UPC bar codes into every product sold in the US. I learned this from a <a href="http://securityfocus.com/columnists/169">great article on RFIDs</a>. If you don’t know what an RFID is and you care at all about your privacy, read <a href="http://securityfocus.com/columnists/169">the article</a> because Wal-Mart will also get RFIDs put into every product you buy in the US.</p>

          <p>I could say the govt took <em>way</em> too long to do this, but I won’t. I’m happy that the <a href="http://donotcall.gov">National Do Not Call Registry</a> is up. Now we need a National Do Not Mail Registry.</p>

<p>I’ll also note that this would not have been feasible before the internet – it would have taken an incredible amount of money and marketing to get people to send in paper forms and an incredible amount of money and humans to process the forms. And the telemarketers would have to have published copies of the list, which would take an incredible amount of money to publish and it would  have been constantly out-of-date if it were only published once a year. But thanks to the internet, the cost is very close to $0.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/business/6174058.htm">San Jose Mercury News</a>: <em>Slap the iSight onto a 15-gigabyte iPod and all of a sudden you’ve got a hard-drive-based camcorder that can hold hours of Quicktime video, plus play music.</em></p>

<p>That would be brilliant. A 30GB iPod could hold up to 120 hours (!) of video. And the little <a href="http://apple.com/isight/">iSight</a> and an iPod in your pocket would be much more convenient than a bulky video camera.</p>
