          <p>After a stop for lunch at a great restaurant in Sanur, Legong Restaurant, we made it to our place in Ubud.</p>

<p>The photo shows our view from the villa, and you can see the <a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/forward.weml?property_name=sayan&amp;">Four Seasons in Sayan</a> (the <em>other</em> Four Seasons in Bali) nestled in the trees.</p>

          <p>It is hot here… even with SPF30 lotion, just an hour or two in the sun has given me sunburn! At 9am it’s too hot to sit in the sun. But we frequently see Balinese in long pants and even jackets since this is almost winter time in Bali – they’re getting chilly. I can’t imagine being here at the peak of summer.</p>

<p>The Four Seasons has been nice but just too “touristy”, not to mention expensive. Before arriving, we read that the Balinese people are very polite and friendly. And it’s true… everyone has been incredibly nice and smiles everywhere (and not just at the hotel). The only Balinese we’ve learned so far is “Tarima Kasih” (Ta-REE-ma Ka-SEE), which means “Thank you”. We say that a lot. It always strikes me how people in the poorest countries in the world that I’ve visited are happy, while Americans, who should be happy, appear unhappy and even angry. I doubt you’d hear a Balinese person say “I hate her/him, they’re so damn happy all the time”. American cynics who read that might say “Sure, they want your money, that’s why they smile at you”, but Americans want my money too, and they don’t smile at me. ;)</p>

<p>We’re checking out today and going inland to <a href="http://www.indo.com/active/ubud.html">Ubud</a> for a week for more relaxation, reading, beering, maybe some shopping and less seafood and more native Indonesian dishes. We will only have dialup internet so posting photos is going to be more difficult, well, time-consuming at least, so I probably won’t be posting as many photos as I have the last few days.</p>

<p>We spent the day tanning, reading, swimming, repeat. Then we went to lunch:

<p><em>The</em> beer in Indonesia:

<p>It’s a light pilsner, which I usually don’t like, but nothing beats a cold Bintang on a hot day.</p>

          <p>Our first breakfast in Bali, room service even. I had bagels and locks, Gay had eggs and sausage. The apple juice is the best apple juice I’ve ever had… can you “fresh-squeeze” an apple?! Gay had papaya juice, which was like a smoothie. The coffee here is very good too, of course.</p>

<p>Indonesian food is actually hard to come by in this area… all the restaurants in Jimbaran Bay serve seafood since it’s a fishing village and there’s some Indonesian sauces (sweet soy, peanut sauce, chile sauce, etc.) but, in general, they seem to cater to international visitors. For example, last night was the first time we found satay. I’m hoping that there’s more local food in Ubud and Semanyak.</p>

<p>Every day the hotel drops by a different fruit. Yesterday, it was “rambutan”:http://www.thefruitpages.com/avocadoes.shtml, something I’ve never seen before, but Gay recognized it from Thailand. You peel off the skin and inside is a squishy center… it’s like eating a big jelly bean without the sugar-coating.</p>
