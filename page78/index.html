              <p>Reading beer blogs, I discovered that the <a href="http://www.njbeerco.com/home.html">New Jersey Beer Co</a> just made a new beer called Hudson Ale. Technically, it’s called “Hudson Pale Ale”, but close enough. They beat us to it, we planned one day to make a beer and call it “Hudson Ale” because Hudson, our son, has a middle name of “Ale”, which was a rejected first name. I own the domain name hudsonale.com just for this purpose. I emailed the brewery asking if I could get a t-shirt or glass or something with this label.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>A neighbor in Seattle just finished their kitchen remodel and <a href="http://www.prestigecustombuilders.com/">the builder</a> had an open house to show it off. Gay also had an OB/GYN appointment today, so it was a convenient time to go into Seattle. The doctor visit was uneventful as usual (which is always good news), we went to the house to check on the progress and to nail a few electrical boxes to the studs where we want the outlets for TVs to go (hidden behind the TVs).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5169177425/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1406/5169177425_fa7103fd64.jpg" alt="Sauna &amp; Bathroom" /></a></p>

<p>The basement bathroom, sauna and gym are all framed so the basement is done with framing. The plumbers were there starting the plumbing rough-in and the bathtubs for the guest bath and both kids’ baths were there waiting to go in.
<!-- more --></p>

<p>Many of the windows had been removed and boarded up while they’re being repaired. So the house looks like a condemned house right now with plywood covering the windows. The new kitchen window was mocked up so we could see its placement on the inside and the outside and it will be slightly changed from the design to look more like the existing windows and to line up with windows when viewed from the outside and to make room for a header beam above it.</p>

<p>The interior designers left some stone samples at the house. We still haven’t decided on the master bath vanity so they left a sample of one they liked. They also left the kitchen tile sample so we could take another look at it in the house. The builders have done some more concrete samples so we could decide on how much to etch the basement concrete floor to get the look we want and which sealant to use. I think we’re decided on that, but want to get Nancy’s (the interior designer) opinion before we finalize it.</p>

<p>We talked with Mark for a while about the attic structural work that needs to happen. Because the dormers need new header beams, there has to be more support for them that carries down to the ground. After they took up part of the attic floor they discovered that there was no beam where they expected one, so the structural engineer needs to get involved (again!) to figure out a solution. The attic is becoming more and more of a headache. We came up with several options to pursue and Mark will work with the engineer to see which can work.</p>

<p>After we nailed up a couple electrical boxes (in the dark!), we went down the street to the neighbor’s open house. There was a nice spread of food and beer and wine out and we talked with a few of the neighbors we’d met already (they are still talking about how great it is that we got rid of those Monkey Puzzle trees – I agree). Since we’re going through a remodel, including a big kitchen remodel, we were very interested to see how their kitchen turned out. The owner is a foodie and she clearly put a lot of thought into the kitchen design and placement of things. They also have the very same refrigerator we’re getting and she raved about it. The wood floor and wood cabinetry was all made of reclaimed lumber and was very nicely done. We also talked with the architect/designer who did the work.</p>

<p>We stayed there for about an hour and then went to meet Jon &amp; Megan at <a href="http://smithpub.com/">Smith</a> for dinner.</p>

              <a class="post-link" href="/2010/11/10/low-voltage-wiring.html">Low-voltage wiring</a>
            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>After dealing with bids from electricians to do the low-voltage work in the house, I’ve decided I’m going to do it myself. I had to buy all the Cat6 and speaker wire and it arrived today:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5164976199/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4092/5164976199_9ae0d58395.jpg" alt="Low-voltage cables" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Low-voltage wiring is a scam in the construction industry. It’s easy to do, it’s not even dangerous like line-voltage electrical work, and the materials are very inexpensive. Yet it costs more to wire a house with low-voltage wiring than it does to wire a house with electricity. They can do this because people think of it as “high-tech” so it must be more complicated and must cost more. So it does.</p>

<p>I won’t name the two companies that bid on the work that we aren’t hiring, but I didn’t like them. The bids just for running cable ranged from the reasonable $7,000 to the unreasonable $18,000, with another at $14,000. The low bid was from a traditional electrician (who we are hiring to do the line voltage work). The others were from companies that do home theater systems.</p>

<p>The company with the highest bid started with a reasonable bid. As we talked to them, they realized that we weren’t going to buy those stupid whole-house audio systems they try to sell and we were going to run the entire system off commodity parts. I provided them with a schematic for the wiring that we wanted and, over a few weeks, I simplified it twice. The sub-contractor updated their bid three times. Each time, with a simpler design, the cost went up. They were determined to make their money one way or another. And they never stopped trying to sell us their proprietary system. The last straw was when they proposed a more expensive system that gave us one (!) audio zone throughout the house. The way they proposed it, if we wanted music in our master bedroom, the speakers outside would also be on for the neighbors to hear; if the kids wanted to listen to their music in the basement, we had to listen to it too in the dining room. They couldn’t see why we wouldn’t want that. Idiots. And people pay them to design home audio systems! After that, we told our general contractor to take them out of the bidding process. These guys also bid on the line-voltage work and in their bid had them running electricity to the deck off the master bedroom. There is no deck off the master bedroom. Sloppy and dumb.</p>

<p>The other bidder was less dumb, but still too expensive. And both wanted to sell us equipment from companies they are dealers for. The total cost of the system, with all the speakers, amps, TVs, etc., was over $80,000. I estimate I can do it all myself, including equipment and wiring, for $30,000. I’ve been trying to find something in the house that I can do and help out and I found it. It should be fun too.</p>

<p>For whole-house audio, we’re going to use traditional receivers and amplifiers with a bunch of Apple TVs + iTunes providing music. This is what we do in our current house and it’s amazing. I can control the music throughout the house with my iPhone or iPad, I don’t have to manage a duplicate library of music and because all the parts are non-proprietary, it’s as inexpensive and as maintainable as you can get. If a part breaks, I can buy a new one from anyone and they’re getting cheaper every day. And the design is so simple that if a part breaks when I want to listen to music in a room, I can easily swap a few cables around in the basement to get music in that room. With a proprietary system, if it breaks, I am a slave to the company that makes it and I have to wait for them to ship me an expensive replacement. And they probably require that a “certified installer” install it for me, which costs even more and takes even longer because I have to wait to fit into their Monday-Friday 9-5 schedule.</p>

<p>For video, I’m going to run Cat6 throughout the house and use <a href="http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=101&amp;cp_id=10105&amp;cs_id=1010504&amp;p_id=6532&amp;seq=1&amp;format=2">HDMI extenders</a> connected via Cat6 to everywhere we want a TV. The HDMI extenders cost $35 each and work great. I bought one and tested it over 150 feet and the video was flawless. One of the sub-contractors proposed a $600 HDMI extender that does the same thing. They don’t understand that digital is digital; it either works or it doesn’t, quality is the same in the digital world.</p>

<p>All the equipment will be stored in the basement in a cabinet and all the wiring will run to the cabinet. This centralizes all the equipment in a room that won’t be heated so the equipment will stay cool, we won’t be able to hear them in the house (DirecTV boxes are loud!), and we don’t need to find space in each room for all the equipment. I was concerned that running speaker wire that far would be a problem. The longest run of speaker wire through the walls and floors will be about 140 feet. Now that the speaker wire arrived today, I tested this. I connected a speaker to the stereo in our office by 500 feet of (12 gauge) speaker wire and it sounded perfectly fine. 140 feet is easy. For remote control, we’ll run IR extenders over Cat6 too. We do this in our current house with <a href="http://www.xantech.com/Infrared/Infrared/DLPCRTRcvrs/DL25/">Xantech products</a> and it works great.</p>

<p>Basically, the entire system is a traditional A/V setup in each room except all the equipment is in the basement and HDMI and IR remote control runs over Cat6 and the speakers are powered by very long speaker wire.</p>

<p>Home theater installers prefer to use systems like Control4 or Savant that cost a fortune and are proprietary – you have to use their poorly-designed remotes – and the companies are so young, it’s unlikely they’ll be in business in 10 years. They tell you that these systems are great because you can route a different video source to every room of the house. What’s so hard about that? Years ago that was difficult. But today with HDMI that carries both audio and video, it’s easy. We’re going to have 2 DirecTV boxes and, through inexpensive HDMI splitters, they’ll both be connected to all the A/V receivers so any room can watch either DirecTV. This limits us to 2 different channels on TV throughout the house, but if that’s a problem, we can add a 3rd DirecTV. But I doubt that will be a problem because we already watch less and less from DirecTV.</p>

<p>Each receiver will have an $99 Apple TV as a source, so any TV can watch that as well so every TV can watch something different from Apple TV. And in 5 to 10 years, that is all we’ll ever need because TV will all be delivered over the internet (some people do that today already). And, using <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/airplay/">AirPlay</a>, any iPhone, iPod touch or iPad can stream audio or video to one or more Apple TVs in the house to provide even more access to content. If Apple goes out of business or another company makes a better product, we can easily switch to that. And it’ll be even cheaper in the future.</p>

<p>Companies like Control4 and Savant that make proprietary home A/V distribution equipment simply won’t be able to compete with inexpensive commodity parts. And I’m not about to make the mistake of using a proprietary system. Our current house had a similar system made by Carver. Carver went out of business about 5 years after the house was built, the system started failing when we bought the house and, because the company doesn’t exist anymore, it can’t be repaired. Worse, the house is littered with ugly control panels that no longer do anything (and they were hard to use). That system must’ve cost $20,000 or more back in the early 90s. I replaced it all with iTunes (free) + Airport Expresses ($99/ea) and traditional receivers ($150/ea) to power the speakers and the entire thing cost $1000. And it’s a better system and far easier to use and is invisible (no wall panels).</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Googling for “<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=octane+fitness+err+3&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Octane Fitness Err 3</a>” doesn’t provide much help, so I’m writing this to get it into Google to provide more info…</p>

<p>We bought an <a href="http://www2.octanefitness.com/">Octane Fitness</a> elliptical machine almost 4 years ago. It’s a great machine and we love it. A year ago it started showing “Err 3” on the display after being used when the Cool Down program finished. We could still use it, we just had to hit the Clear button and it was fine. I couldn’t find much of anything about this online so we called the dealer where we bought it. They concluded that it needed a new right stride motor – the motor that adjusts the length of the running stride. Octane shipped them a new one for free and we paid the $125 or so for their repair man to come over and install it. That fixed it for a while. It started doing it again a few months later so Octane thought it was one of the logic boards that was failing. They shipped them a new one of those and we paid the $125 or so for the guy to install that.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>It worked fine for several months until about 4 weeks ago, when it got much worse. It used to go to “Err 3” only after  a run, but this time it would do it after running just 1/4 mile or so. I could reset it and keep running but it would continue every few minutes or even less. This made using the machine impossible. I called Octane Fitness myself this time and talked to a very helpful tech support guy. It almost always showed Err 3 but this time it was also showing Err 2 some times. Because of this, he thought it was the logic board again so he sent me one for free and said I could install it myself and save the $125. I got it a week later and he was right, it was easy to install. But it didn’t fix it. There was no improvement at all.</p>

<p>I called Octane Fitness again, talked to the same guy and he went through some tests on the machine with me over the phone and concluded that the right stride motor was again the problem. He sent me a new stride motor for free and, again, shipped it directly to me and said I could install it myself. At this point, I hadn’t used it for over a week and wanted to get the part quicker. I explained that I appreciated him sending me the part for free, but I offered to pay for overnight or 2nd Day shipping to get it sooner. He refused to take my money and shipped it 2nd Day. I got the part, installed it, which was not as easy as the logic board, but it did fix the problem.</p>

<p>I learned that Err 3 means the right stride motor is failing and Err 2 means the left stride motor is failing. Err 3 is much more common because it always checks the right motor first and only checks the left if the right passed the test. The logic board runs tests on it frequently and any error at all causes it to show the error code. It’d be nice if there was a way to bypass the error-check and continue to use the machine, just without the ability to adjust the stride. I still don’t know what the problem was because I was seeing both Err 3 and Err 2. Either the left stride motor is about to fail too or the logic board <em>and</em> the right stride motor were faulty and both needed to be replaced.</p>

<p>It’s annoying that the stride motors on the machine are so apt to break, but I am very happy with Octane Fitness’ tech support and customer service for sending me parts for free every time and not even charging me for shipping! And the tech support guy (Eric?) was very polite, friendly and patient. Several weeks ago I was very upset with the machine and was expecting to have to buy a whole new machine and from a competitor (who probably has other problems with their machines). But today, I wouldn’t hesitate to buy another Octane Fitness machine. In fact, the new models look so nice I’m considering getting a new one anyway.</p>

              <p>As of today, I’ve made 41 trips around the sun. I hope I get a lot more. Gay made me birthday dinner, as usual, and got a ton of nice beers for me to pick from while she cooked.

<p>Summary of my 41st year:</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Just a few days before my 40th last year, my dad had a sudden visit to the hospital and they found he had cancer in his kidney. <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/11/22/my-dad-is-cancer-free/">He had it removed</a> and is cancer-free.</p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/12/06/seattle-to-cabo/">We went to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico</a> for a winter vacation.</p>

<p>We were working with Tom Kundig on designing a new house on Vashon and were getting cold feet about staying on Vashon, so we took three trips, in <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/01/15/san-francisco-2/">January</a>, February (with Havana) and in March with both kids via <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/03/21/tahoe/">Tahoe</a>, to San Francisco to see about real estate there.</p>

<p>Havana had <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/03/25/havanas-first-ski-lesson/">her first ski lesson</a> while in Tahoe.</p>

<p>Hudson had his first (and hopefully last) <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/03/11/hudsons-first-stitches/">stitches</a> after mysteriously falling on something (we still don’t know).</p>

<p>We celebrated <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/04/30/happy-birthday-havana-3/">Havana’s 3rd birthday</a>.</p>

<p>We decided to not build the house on Vashon and <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/06/01/moving-back-to-seattle/">to buy a house in Seattle</a> instead. We finally <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/06/16/bought-a-house-in-seattle/">bought a house in Seattle</a> in June and closed on it July 19. It’s been under renovation ever since.</p>

<p>Gay and I celebrated <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/07/31/6th-wedding-anniversary/">our 6th wedding anniversary</a>.</p>

<p>Hudson <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/08/25/happy-birthday-hudson-2/">turned 2</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/08/04/baby-3-20-week-ultrasound/">Baby #3</a> was conceived and is mostly done.</p>
