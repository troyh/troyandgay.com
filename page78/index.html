        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>I always look at “top lists” of cities to live in, even though they’re usually chosen by dubious standards and really just meant to sell copies of the magazine in the markets they list (“Lookie! We’re on the list!”). Money magazine just did one on “the best small towns” and I was shocked to see the place I grew up, Centreville, VA, as <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2010/snapshots/PL5114440.html">#30 on the list</a>. Centreville recently became (in)famous as the hometown of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seung-Hui_Cho">the Virginia Tech murderer</a>. Centreville was a horrible horrible horrible place when I lived there. I couldn’t wait to move. So what made Money like it?</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Money says:</p>

<blockquote>Washington, D.C., is anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour and a half away, depending on traffic.</blockquote>

<p>I love that the range of travel times doesn’t even phase the editors of Money magazine. And I think they’re even optimistic about those times! It’s only <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=Centreville,+VA&amp;daddr=Washington,+DC&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=CQRzgjE_H-UoFUeoUAIdc4di-ynznkp6gUS2iTEs2skWESuTCQ%3B&amp;mra=ls&amp;sll=38.840391,-77.428877&amp;sspn=0.348171,0.220757&amp;g=Centreville,+VA&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=11">24 miles away from DC</a>, but it took 45 minutes on a light traffic day and could take 2-3 hours when traffic is bad when I lived there in the mid-1990s. I can’t imagine it’s gotten any better since then.</p>

<p>When I was working and living in an area about as far away as Centreville is from DC, I got sick of the 90-minute stop-and-go commute to my job just outside of DC that I started riding my bike to work instead. It took me 90 minutes to bike it each way (regardless of traffic, of course), which meant cars travel at the same speed as bikes and sometimes slower.</p>

<p>Incidentally, hardly a day went by that I wasn’t honked-at or yelled-at by motorists, had things thrown at me and was called “faggot” a few times, just for riding a bike. This is the behavior of affluent supposedly-educated Northern Virginians who are angry about wasting their lives in traffic. That’s another story, but I don’t see how a place filled with people like this is anything but a horrible place to live even if you don’t ride a bike.</p>

<p>The other good thing Money had to say about it:</p>

<blockquote>With major shopping centers nearby and the Bull Run Mountains an hour's drive away, Centerville [sic] lives up to its name.</blockquote>

<p>“Major shopping centers” must mean “tons of strip malls” and the “Bull Run Mountains” should be called “Bull Run Hills”. And an hour’s drive away is not close. They may as well claim it’s a beach-front community – the beach is just a three-hours’ drive away.</p>

<p>The comments from people who live there confirm that it hasn’t improved since I escaped:</p>

<blockquote>Too many people, horrible traffic, pretentious people. don't move here (or Gaithersburg) unless you like lots of people, enjoy traffic jams and aggressive drivers, and are a snob. Look further west of this town.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I love it. Centreville SUCKS...I mean Centreville is not that bad but it's the whole NOVA experience that comes with it (like it or not). Stopping at every traffic light, take off at one to stop at another. If you like sitting at 4 minute traffic lights and going 10 miles in 1hr then this place is for you. Getting out as soon as I can! Unfortunately the jobs and money are here. But unless you can afford $200K for an old run down townhouse or $160 for a condo your living in an apartment for $1,100-$2,000 a month depending on your requirements.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Townhouse Central. Nice area in Fairfax County, but I think I just lost all respect for Money's reports.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Centreville is a joke. It should be in top 5 worst places to live in the US.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Are they kidding? The traffic is a nightmare. There's no town. It's a sprawling burb
I have lived in Northern Virginia for 42 years, (I grew up in McLean) my brother owns a town house in Centreville and I lived there for two years. There is no way Centreville deserves to be on this list. I don't even see it as in the top 100 places to live in Virginia.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When did Centreville become a "historic town?" It is the epitome of suburban sprawl, with some historic Civil War sites. The town, if one can call it that, is anything but historic. C'ville is an indistinguishable suburban enclave with lots of strip malls and ubiquitous housing developments. As someone who lived in the area for 30 years (DC, Fairfax, Burke, and Centreville), there are plenty of better places to live in the DC area.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Really????? This is not a great area at all. Try living there and getting to work. Try getting anywhere on a saturday or sunday down 66. This is a middle to lower class area, probably a bit closer to middle. [Racism deleted] I dont get it. Having Gaithersburg ranked number 30 is even worse. There are 5 or 10 cities in this area alone that are much nicer places to live. Reston, Mclean, Potomac, Bethesda and Ashburn, just to name a few. This survey is terrible.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Seriously...Centreville??? I lived here when I first moved to DC. 30th in the US? What a joke. This neighborhood isn't even 30th in Northern Va. Besides...it would have to be classified as Fairfax, Va, which is a huge area with many neighborhoods. Maybe they are trying to include South Riding and beyond...but then that is Chantilly and still Fairfax county. Maybe they meant Clifton?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Terrible choice. Traffic, long commutes, suburban hell. Great for folks who like to spend a lot of time in their cars and aren't interested in cultural activities or the arts easily accessible.</blockquote>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>We went to our first block party on our new street tonight. They have a huge grill that they wheel out to the middle of the block and everyone grilled their dinner, drank beer and wine and the kids run around.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4780491736/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4082/4780491736_0f6ab3c09f.jpg" alt="Block party" /></a>
<!-- more --></p>

<p>Havana and Hudson had a great time playing with all the other kids. Hudson seemed to have a crush on a girl named Campbell and spent most of his time with her. We aren’t used to just letting them run around without us watching them, but all the other older kids watched them for us. The weather was perfect. At our place on Vashon, you can’t sit outside past 8 or 9pm without getting cold, even after a 90° day because we get a cool breeze off the water. We left just before 10pm and it was still nice on Capitol Hill. Havana fell asleep in the car but Hudson was so energized he was wide awake the whole way home.</p>

<p>Everyone we met was great and everyone offered advice on the remodeling we’re going to do. It seems every house on the block has had some remodeling over the years. They all think we’re optimistic to believe it’ll only take 9-10 months. Yikes.</p>

<p>We learned a few things about our house: They really did have 13 kids. They owned a house down the street and had 10 kids in that house and then moved to our house and had 3 more; we met the couple who bought their house from them years ago. The wood floors are so well-preserved because they put red shag carpeting throughout the house. Lucky for us! The house was featured in Better Homes &amp; Gardens in the 1930s as “one of the most beautiful houses on the west coast” or something like that. That’s probably a bit of a stretch, but we’re hoping we can restore its charm and character.</p>

<p>I did an informal poll of people about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araucaria_araucana">Monkey Puzzle trees</a> in our yard and all but one would prefer to see them go – some equal my disgust of them. Even the one holdout just likes them because they’re unique (I’ll grant him that), not because they’re attractive. That’s good news because Monkey Puzzle trees are the most and only disturbing tree I’ve ever seen and I want to get rid of them while not upsetting the neighbors who I worried might like them. They also drop “leaves” that are like razor blades, so removing them is a public safety service.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>We’re not even officially owners of the house yet and we were invited to the block party this Friday. One of the residents of the street emailed our real estate agent asking him to forward the invite to us. Very neighborly! I guess they block the street off, have a barbecue grill and drinks and the kids play and ride bikes in the street. They do this a few times every summer. Sounds great. They even have a mailing list for the neighborhood and they added us to it already. I’m already liking living there.</p>

<p>When we lived in Seattle in the late 90s we’d heard of neighborhood block parties, even saw a few, but our street never had one. If my memory is accurate (unlikely), I recall attending a block party once on our street when I was a kid.</p>

<p>It should give us a chance to apologize in advance for the construction we’re going to introduce to the neighborhood. ;)</p>

        <article>
          <p>After almost 11 years with my loved <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/Products/Aeron-Chairs">Aeron</a> chair, I couldn’t resist the annual Herman Miller sale so I bought <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/29/technology/herman_miller.fortune/">their attempt to better their Aeron</a>, the <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/Products/Embody-Chairs">Embody</a>. Delivery took 4 weeks and it arrived today.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4769112458/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4116/4769112458_c6f7b759c1.jpg" alt="Herman Miller Embody" /></a></p>

<p>The Aeron is so comfortable that I trusted the designers enough with the Embody that I bought it without ever sitting in it. Still, I was skeptical that they could have improved that much on the Aeron. They did it. The Embody is <a href="http://hermanmiller.com/Adjusting-Embody">more adjustable</a>, even easier to adjust, especially in the arms, has a more comfortable back, has an adjustable seat length to support my legs all the way to my knees and is just a little more firm. I’m still not decided on whether the material is better than the airy Aeron material but time will tell.</p>
