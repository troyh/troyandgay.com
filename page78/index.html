              <p>We had dinner before the show at <a href="http://www.lecosho.com/">Lecösho</a>, a place we’ve never been. Since we paid for parking at Benaroya Hall, we could walk to the restaurant from the parking garage, just a block west in Harbor Steps. It was a great evening and we caught the end of the sunset from the restaurant.</p>

<p>We had Penn Cove mussels and beef short ribs for appetizers, I had the salmon (of course) for my entree and Gay had the Porchetta, which was stuffed pork wrapped in pig skin cooked slowly for several hours. For dessert, I had an ice cream sandwich, which was a scoop of chocolate ice cream, a scoop of blood orange sorbet and a scoop of corn and cinnamon (!) ice cream sandwiched between two pieces of shortbread. Gay had the chocolate torte. Everything was very good.I had the <a href="http://www.belgianexperts.com/Dupont.php">Saison DuPont farmhouse ale</a> with dinner, which went well with the food.</p>

              <p>Since we were going into Seattle for <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/10/20/belle-sebastian-at-benaroya-hall/">the Belle &amp; Sebastian show</a>, we went to the house to check on progress again. The electrical panel has been moved from the family room area down to the mechanical room below in the basement, the old panel and wall it was on have been removed and both panels are installed in the basement. We saw the west wall of the basement that they grinded to potentially leave it exposed. They put panels showing where the skylights will go in the attic, which helps them figure out where new rafters can go that they structural engineer is demanding but no one understands. The new steel beam for the garage has been delivered and is waiting to be installed. They tested a patch of <a href="http://www.fogcoat.com/">fog coat</a> on the exterior to see how well it covers. We also saw another concrete sample for the basement floor, which we’re still not happy with, and there’s more of those coming in the next few days.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>The US Government’s TARP bailout of the financial institutions has reaped <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-20/bailout-of-wall-street-returns-8-2-profit-to-taxpayers-beating-treasuries.html">a 8.2% profit, or $25 billion</a>. The people (I’m looking at you Republicans and Tea Party tards) who say that government can’t do anything right don’t know history. And now we can say that they don’t understand math either.</p>

<p>The bailout of GM and Chrysler will not pay off, we’ll lose $17 billion on those clowns. But the AIG bailout also profited $11 billion. In total, the bailouts not only didn’t cost the US taxpayer a penny, they saved the economy from decades of recession, probably even a depression, and they profited $19 billion. And in less than 2 years.</p>

<p>Giving credit where credit is due, it was the Bernanke and Paulson that alerted Congress to do something, who made it possible for Bush to sign it and make it happen. Aside from the Republicans in Congress who opposed the bailouts, two responsible Republicans and a Democratic Congress worked together. Government solved yet another problem that the private sector couldn’t.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>This weekend is Elysian’s Pumpkin Beer Festival, so we decided to go into the city today to taste some of the 40 (!) pumpkin beers on tap. I love pumpkin beers. We packed the kids in the car and got on the 12:50p ferry. We stopped at Beer Junction to stock up on some new beers and then went to the house to take some photos of the progress.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5087603853/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4124/5087603853_f7e83c5517.jpg" alt="photo.JPG" /></a></p>

<p>The kids had fun running around the house. They don’t see it as often as we do so it’s always new to them. We headed to Elysian and, egads, found the line of people wrapping around the corner and down the entire block. I refuse to wait in lines, especially with kids so it was easy to nix that plan. We went to Cal Anderson park instead and let the kids play. Then we went to Circa in West Seattle for dinner but they were closed. Our last chance was Zeeks Pizza. The kids were tired and slept right after leaving Capitol Hill, so we had to wake them up for dinner.</p>

<p>We got home, put the kids to bed and turned on the UW vs Oregon State game and, fortunately, I bought Elysian’s Great Pumpkin beer at The Beer Junction today, so I could pretend that I didn’t miss their pumpkin festival again.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>We submitted our permit application on September 1, we waited patiently but never heard anything about it. Gay called Seattle DPD a few times to find out what the status is and today, got confirmation that we could cut down the Monkey Puzzle trees. They even said we didn’t need a permit:</p>

<blockquote>I have reviewed your application. According to the tree ordinance #25.11.040 B, you can go ahead and take the two Monkey Puzzle trees down without approval from DPD, as there are no ECA’s (Environmentally Critical Areas) on your property and you are not taking down more than three trees within a one year period. If you have further questions or concerns feel free to contact me.</blockquote>

<p>I wish we knew this weeks ago, but at least we don’t have to pay for the permit. Seattle should be paying us to remove those trees anyway. The Capitol Hill beautification day is October 27.</p>
