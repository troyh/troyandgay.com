          </h3>
            <p>Lots of Google news today… tomorrow “will bring”:http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3394401 their long-awaited and now famous Dutch auction IPO. And for such a well-run company (apparently), they’ve been doing a terrible job with their IPO; first an investigation in an illegal issuing of shares and now they’re being investigated by the SEC for violating the “quiet period” by “granting an interview”:http://news.com.com/Google+revealed+in+Playboy+interview%3F/2100-1038_3-5307955.html?part=rss&amp;tag=5307955&amp;subj=news.1038.5 to Playboy. I just can’t understand why this company is thought to be so valuable. They’re profitable (or so they say) and their search engine doesn’t suck (well, it does, but nobody quite realizes it yet), their Gmail service is not any more interesting than anyone else’s, and to top it all off, they’re really an ad agency. Our favorite ad agency, honestly, but an ad agency nonetheless.</p>

Congratulations, John! :)  The only pic we have of John is this one when he took us to a Mariners game last year – he’s the one on the right.</p>

            <p><img src="http://images.apple.com/airportexpress/images/airtunescables06072004.gif" alt="Airport Express" /> We also got “Airport Express”:http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/ days before the wedding. Good thing, because we ended up having to put the amplifier upstairs so we could control the music via a laptop downstairs.</p>

<p>Overall, Airport Express is good, but there were some problems. For one, it was the most difficult install I’ve ever done with an Apple product. I figured I would just plug it into the wall, plug in the ethernet and the audio cable and I’d be done. Apple is so good, this is what I expected. But I actually had to install some software from the CD that came with it. Ugh! The software is a configuration utility for the Airport Express; and then I had to download iTunes 4.6 to get AirTunes. I know Windows users are thinking “So? I have to install several things, reboot 4 times and talk to tech support for 90 minutes whenever I get new hardware. And I’m lucky if I don’t have to reinstall Windows or get 37 Windows Updates that don’t work.” But for an Apple product, this was painful – it took me almost 15 minutes to get it working.</p>

<p>But the most signficant problem with it is that it just cuts out often. Simon Willison has “noticed the same problem”:http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/08/03/airport. It worked great for a couple days before the wedding, but of course, the day of the wedding it started to do this. I thought our 2.4GHz phone was interfering with the WiFi, especially when neighbors were calling (at 10pm!) about the music. But I guess it’s just a bug.</p>

<p>What I did learn that just amazed me is that I could get a reliable WiFi connection at the end of our front yard, a good 200 yards from the house. Several months ago we got a “Linksys WRT54G”:http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?prid=508&amp;scid=35, an 802.11g base station, and the range is far greater than our older 802.11b Linksys. We were streaming MP3s from the house to the front yard to play during the ceremony. I wonder if all our neighbors have learned they can have free internet access off our WiFi base stations. :)</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We finally watched three movies we’ve had from Netflix for weeks: “The House of Sand and Fog”:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0315983/, “The Fog of War”:http://www.errolmorris.com/ and “Girl with a Peal Earring”:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335119/.  <em>The House of Sand and Fog</em> was great but very very sad. <em>Girl with a Pearl Earring</em> was booorrrriiiing – making a fictional movie about how a painting was made is a bad idea.</p>

<p>But <em>The Fog of War</em> was good. Not great, but good. It’s intended to be a lesson about war, what works and what doesn’t as told by a man in the center of the Cold War. But to me, it shows how someone simply trying to make the world a better place, “Robert McNamara”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNamara, is both praised and vilified at the same time. He did well tactically in WWII, helped resolve the Cuban Missile Conflict peacefully, became President of Ford Motor Company and turned them profitable again, but then went back to government to become the Secretary of Defense and got mired in Vietnam and eventually fired. And that’s his legacy. All the successes and he’s forever to be remembered as the “warmonger” of Vietnam.</p>

<p>There are good lessons for anyone involved in conflict, not just states at war, such as to empathize with your enemy, get as much data as possible, etc. What I thought was most interesting is McNamara talking about a General LeMay’s beliefs about war…. essentially kill them before they kill you and rationalize it later. One thing that doesn’t seem to be as true of war these days that I’ve never understood is that the targets are almost exclusively civilians. In WWII, they firebombed Tokyo simply to destroy it and kill as many people as possible and that was meaningful to victory. Today we tend to target military operations almost exclusively (or so we’re told).</p>

<p>But given the times, you’re left with one of McNamara’s recommendations: never go to war unilaterally. He says that if you can’t convince your allies that your war is just, it probably isn’t. Too bad Rumsfeld isn’t as smart as McNamara.</p>

            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/appledisplay.jpg" alt="apple display" />I got a new Apple Cinema Display right in the middle of heavy wedding action, so I haven’t had a chance to truly enjoy it until this week.  I have regained an enormous amount of real estate on my desk, leaving my old two monitor configuration behind, but more importantly this is the crispest, brightest, most beautiful computer thing I’ve ever owned.  I love doing work.  I love being able to work in my editor, check my work in an open browser, while still having room on screen to get to email or my calendar with a click AND carry on 2 instant messenger conversations at the same time…all without having to turn my head in the slightest or run my mouse from screen to screen.</p>
