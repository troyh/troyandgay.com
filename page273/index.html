            <p>“Kerry and Bush differ on a national sales tax”:http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/usatoday/20040813/ts_usatoday/kerryslamspresidentovernationalsalestax</p>

<p>I admit I used to think that a sales tax was the most fair way to tax people. Rich people buy more expensive things so they would pay higher taxes, right? Nope. It turns out that the tax would hit the middle-class and lower-income citizens the most. The problem with a sales tax is that it’s the same percentage for all people. So if Bill Gates buys a loaf of bread for $2, he pays the same tax that someone who earns minimum wage. Fair, maybe, but certainly not good for anyone. And if the sales tax on a new Lexus were higher, Bill Gates would buy fewer of them. Republicans believe that the wealthy (and large corporations) need fewer taxes because they drive the economy. But they don’t. The masses (and small businesses) drive growth in the economy. The rich aren’t rich because they spend money, they’re rich because they don’t spend money.</p>

            <p>“Switching away from IE”:http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/12/technology/circuits/12brow.html?ei=5090&amp;en=2e6b25eafd7f2db7&amp;ex=1250049600&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;pagewanted=all: <em>Ms. Sandlin is so devoted to her browser that she has taped a note to her monitor warning guests not to click on the desktop shortcut to Internet Explorer. “Do not touch the blue ‘E!’ “ the note says.</em></p>

<p>IE has 94% marketshare still according to WebSideStory, but on Recipezaar, it’s already down to 80% and seems to be steadily dropping. From what we can tell, the #1 reason people stick with IE is because “it’s what I know”. Other reasons are to keep the Google toolbar because of its popup-blocking feature and the resistance to downloading another browser. But those that switched sure seem to love their new browser (Firefox mostly it seems).</p>

            <p>“Julia Child dies at 91”:http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/13/dining/13CND-CHILD.html, apparently of kidney failure. The introduction to her 7th book: “Dining with one’s friends and beloved family is certainly one of life’s primal and most innocent delights, one that is both soul-satisfying and eternal.”</p>

<p>They’ve organized a “Cook-A-Thon as a tribute”:http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?p=1176046 to Julia.</p>

            <p>“The Pixies”:http://www.4ad.com/artists/catalogue/pixies/ are still innovative. “Ignoring the music biz”:http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=P5353_0_6_0_C. And <em>Bam Thwok</em> is as good as anything they’ve ever done. FWIW, I also loved “Frank Black’s”:http://www.frankblack.net/ first two albums, <em>Frank Black</em> and <em>The Teenager of the Year</em>. Loved ‘em, just loved ‘em.</p>

            <p>The internet “continues to rise in importance to Americans”:http://news.com.com/Study%3A+Offline+still+beats+online+for+some+activities/2100-1025_3-5307538.html?part=rss&amp;tag=5307538&amp;subj=news.1025.5. 88% say it plays a role in their daily lives, 30% say it plays a “major role”. But what are people looking for online? News? Music? Porn? Recipes? Nope. They want driving directions. :(  Weird, I think I’ve used the internet for driving directions 4 or 5 times in 8 years.</p>

<p>But really, why are we listening to polls to find out what people do on the internet? Can’t computers tell us what people do online?? And would anyone even answer “Porn” when asked what they use the internet for?</p>
