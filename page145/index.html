        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Sarah Palin <em>is</em> a bad parent. Todd Palin is a bad parent too. Not because their teenage daughter became pregnant, but because they are continuing to ignore the problem. They may be wonderful people with many talents and have the best of intentions, but their parenting skills are not top-notch. Put aside the Republican Party’s political correctness and holier-than-thou preaching. Teenage pregnancies are a failure of the parent and they’re not good for the country or for society. That’s why the Republican Party has (rightly) for years chastised parents when it happens and (wrongly) talked about how we need a return of morality in the country. Now they want to ignore the problem because it happened to their VP candidate during an election year. That’s the definition of hypocrisy.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>If my daughter gets pregnant as a teenager I hope people call me a bad parent because it’s the truth. My refusal to accept it doesn’t do me, my daughter, my son (or any other kids I may have in the future) any good. My fear of being a bad parent is what will make me work harder to be a better parent. That’s good for me and, more importantly, my kids.</p>

<p>Failure and mistakes are not things to be ignore. They are wonderful learning experiences <em>if</em> they are recognized and dealt with. When I ran my own business, what I consider my first child, I made tons of mistakes. I was a terrible business-owner for many years and my business suffered for it. Some people were polite and pretended that the mistakes weren’t made and they thought they were helping me. But the people that helped me were the people who pointed out my mistakes. The people who criticized me, and many did it with great pleasure, helped me the most! The business was successful <em>because</em> I wasn’t allowed to pretend I didn’t make mistakes. I focused on the mistakes, I figured out what I did wrong and I figured out how I can prevent that mistake from happening again. I wasn’t always successful, some mistakes were repeated, but because I embraced the mistakes and worked on fixing them, my business became more successful. Had I brushed the mistakes and failings under the carpet, as the Republican Party is trying to do with Sarah Palin’s mistakes, my business would have been a failure.</p>

<p>Running a business is difficult. But parenting is even more difficult. So it shouldn’t be a surprise that most people fail at it at one time or another. And sometimes they fail in big ways, like Sarah and Todd Palin have. They’re not evil people. They shouldn’t be banished from society and their kids shouldn’t be taken away from them. But they could improve as parents. People who succeed in life are those that recognize their mistakes and work to correct them so that they don’t repeat them. People who fail in life are people who make the same mistakes over and over. Thanks to Sarah Palin and the Republican Party, the country is not allowed to have a conversation about teenage pregnancy and how best to prevent it in the future. We’re asking for more teenage pregnancies if we let the Republican Party brush this under the rug.</p>

<p>Sarah Palin is an advocate of teaching abstinence before marriage and against teaching sex education. If she were a smart person she’d recognize that teaching abstinence doesn’t work. If she were a good parent, she’d admit that teaching abstinence doesn’t work. Sarah Palin told her daughter to abstain and hoped that’d work. She may like to pretend that her daughter and her boyfriend were practicing abstinence but, oops, didn’t abstain just once. My guess is that they were having sex for months and either Sarah and Todd Palin didn’t know about it or they ignored it. Either way, that’s bad parenting. Her refusal to admit this mistake is why she’s a bad parent.</p>

<p>The Republican Party wouldn’t demand that a pregnant teenager is a private issue or that it is “off limits” to the media if Chelsea Clinton or one of Obama’s kids got pregnant. Hillbillies like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly would be preaching from their ivory towers on the immorality of Democrats. John McCain would be running ads about how your kids will become pregnant if Obama is elected. When it happens to a Republican, not only is it okay (some even call it a “blessed event”) it’s touted as evidence that Sarah Palin is an even better mother and even more Presidential. And the American people eat it up. If only the American people understood that the election is about what’s best for the country, not what’s best for the careers of John McCain and Sarah Palin.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The National Enquirer is <a href="http://www.nationalenquirer.com/_palin_family_shockers_what_sarahs_really_hiding/celebrity/65407">reporting more stories</a> about the Palins as parents. If those turn out to be true, it’s a sad day for American journalism that the Enquirer is the only paper that reports the truth. The Republican Party wants America to embrace Palin’s “biography”, but not necessarily the true biography, the one that is manufactured on The Straight Talk Express.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>By Thursday, Ouzo’s breathing had become very labored. Throughout the night Thursday night/Friday morning he didn’t sleep at all because he could barely lay down comfortably. I spent most of the night trying to get him comfortable enough to sleep. He couldn’t put his head on the ground, presumably because of the fluid in his chest, so I gave him a bunch of pillows to rest his head on. That worked for maybe an hour and he slept a little (and so did I). Friday morning we took him to the vet to have his chest cavity drained of fluid. That took over three hours and they drained more than one liter of fluid.</p>

<p>He’s better today and can move around more easily than he could this week. But he still barely eats and I have to carry him up and down the stairs. And he still has a lot of trouble sitting or laying down. His breathing seems to be less labored, but he still seems to struggle to breathe.</p>

<p>We’ve come to the conclusion that we aren’t going to do another chemo treatment. He doesn’t respond well to chemo – he vomited and had diarrhea all week and was very lethargic. And given that he will need to have fluid drained more frequently, which is rough on him too, we feel like we’re prolonging his life but it’s not a very good quality of life for him. So unless he has a miraculous recovery, we’re going to have to let him go sometime in the next week.</p>

<p>The vet, by the way, has doctors and assistants that are knowledgeable and have good bed-side manners, but the customer service is lousy. We got to the vet by 10am, they took Ouzo almost immediately and told us that they’d call us when he’s ready. The time estimate was an hour. So we went to a mall and then to Starbucks for lunch. An hour-and-a-half later we hadn’t yet heard from them so we called. They said they had <em>just</em> started the draining process. We asked how much longer it’d be and were told that it’d be done “shortly” and they suggested that we come back to the vet and he’d be ready to go by the time we got there. Ten minutes later we arrived back at the vet and, again, they said he’d be ready “shortly”. Another hour-and-a-half later, he was out. I took Ouzo and Hudson out to the car while Gay got the discharge papers and to pay the bill. Twenty minutes later, Gay was still waiting for the discharge papers and the bill! You’d think they were really busy, but they weren’t. They always have about 7 people hanging out behind the desk doing little or nothing. Eventually, Gay just walked out and told them to call her when they want us to pay. The place has “mixed reviews”:http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3723219909 from other people.</p>

          <p>This is priceless. Republican strategist Mike Murphy and Republican mouthpiece Peggy Noonan say what they really think about Sarah Palin when they think they’re not on camera:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/CrG8w4bb3kg&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1">http://www.youtube.com/v/CrG8w4bb3kg&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1</a></p>

<p>Transcript:</p>

<blockquote>Mike Murphy: ...Because I come from a blue swing state governor world, you know, Angler, Whitman, Tommy Thompson, Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush, and these guys... this is all like, how do you want to pick this race (?)... just run it up. And, it's not gonna work.

Peggy Noonan: It's over.

Mike Murphy: Still, McCain can give a version of Lieberman's speech and do himself some good.

Chuck Todd: The Palin pick is insulting to Kay Bailey Hutchison

Peggy Noonan: I saw Kaye this morning

Mike Murphy:  Yeah she's never gonna feel comfortable about this. They're all bummed out

Chuck Todd: I mean, is she really the most qualified woman?

Peggy Noonan: The most qualified? No. I think the went for this, excuse me, political bullshit, about narratives...

Chuck Todd: Yeah, but what's the narrative?

Peggy Noonan: Every time the Republicans do that, because that's not where they live, and it's not what they're good at, and they blow it.

Mike Murphy: You know what's really the worst thing about it? The greatest of McCain is no cynicism, and this is cynical, and it's gimmicky.</blockquote>

<p>This ticket is creating one of the few litmus tests in politics: if you ever hear someone admit they voted for McCain/Palin, you can safely write them off as a gullible idiot.</p>

          <p>Sarah Palin’s 17-year old unmarried daughter “is pregnant”:http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/01/palin.daughter/index.html?eref=rss_topstories. Classic. In 2006, she was asked about sex ed programs in schools:</p>

<p>bq. Will you support funding for abstinence-until-marriage education instead of for explicit sex-education programs, school-based clinics, and the distribution of contraceptives in schools?
SP: Yes, the explicit sex-ed programs will not find my support.</p>

<p>No wonder her daughter is pregnant. The abstinence-until-marriage education didn’t work for her own daughter because it doesn’t work period.</p>

<p>Refuting the Republican Party’s claim that she’s really smart, when asked about “Under God” in the pledge of allegiance, “she answered”:http://eagleforumalaska.blogspot.com/2006/07/2006-gubernatorial-candidate.html:</p>

<p>bq. Are you offended by the phrase “Under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance? Why or why not?
SP: Not on your life. If it was good enough for the founding fathers, its good enough for me and I’ll fight in defense of our Pledge of Allegiance</p>

<p>Uhhh… a person running for VP didn’t know that the founding fathers didn’t write the Pledge of Allegiance or that the original version did not include “Under God”? Do they have schools in Alaska? Lets ask her how to spell “potato” and see if she’s even dumber than Dan Quayle.</p>

<p>Another question she was asked:</p>

<p>bq. Do you support the Alaska Supreme Court’s ruling that spousal benefits for state employees should be given to same-sex couples? Why or why not?
SP: No, I believe spousal benefits are reserved for married citizens as defined in our constitution.</p>

<p>What a dumbass… marriage is not defined or even mentioned in our Constitution.</p>

<p>And, of course, she lied about not supporting the “Bridge To Nowhere”. While campaigning, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/31/AR2008083102017.html">she fully-supported the project</a>.</p>

<p>Did McCain put <em>any</em> thought into this pick? Come on McCain, do the right thing for the country: kick her off the ticket and pick someone with a brain.</p>
