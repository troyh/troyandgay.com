          </h3>
            <p>The forms came off the concrete walls last week and every day that I looked at them I was worried that they didn’t fit the house the way we wanted them to. I kept it to myself all week but couldn’t get over it. The original plan for the decks, as designed by the architects, was to have them both cantilever out from the house, as if they were floating.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The building code dictates that a person is only allowed to fall 30 inches (a magic number for injuries, I guess), so if a platform is more than 30 inches a guard rail is required to keep people from falling. We didn’t want guard rails because they’re ugly. Tom Kundig suggested putting concrete planters – boxes containing dirt with plants or trees in them – around the deck because he, who doesn’t like guard rails either, knows this gets around the building code. Apparently, falling 30 inches is okay if you hit something on your way down. So before we hired a landscape architect, the plan was to  have two decks on a single plane surrounded by concrete planters. Simple enough.</p>

<p>Months later, we hired a landscape architect and he made some changes to that design. He lengthened the south deck and, instead of a single plane, made it drop by two steps to a sitting area and then another two steps to the original grade where our dining area would be. We loved the changes, but ran them by Tom Kundig to double-check and he liked it better than his own design. So we had been set to go forward with the design as soon as the house interior was complete and we were moved in.</p>

<p>The concrete forms were built a few weeks ago and the concrete was poured. The forms were eventually removed and the walls looked great. But I had a nagging feeling that they were “too much”. We always talked about how the house should be like <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=2001+a+space+odyssey&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;prmd=ivnsb&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TNdSTrzYOKPniAKf-PTnDA&amp;ved=0CHAQsAQ&amp;biw=1068&amp;bih=1066">some of the sets in 2001: A Space Oddysey</a> – a mix of modern and traditional that work together. And I love how <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=the+louvre+paris&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;prmd=ivnsm&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=z9ZSTsWdA-rSiAKymIjtDA&amp;ved=0CEAQsAQ&amp;biw=1068&amp;bih=1066">I.M. Pei’s addition to the Louvre</a> in Paris is super modern but complements the old building behind it. I was scared we went too far.</p>

<p>Despite the reassurances from everyone that it will work when it’s all done, I had us all going through ideas to modify the walls and even take them out completely and start over. This put the plans on hold to build the south deck, so I was very conscious of how quickly I had to get this straight in my head.</p>

<p>Our interior designer told me that the problem I see is that the deck wasn’t in yet so the walls looked a lot bigger than they will eventually appear. That was true. Scott, the landscape architect, assured me that it continues the changes we made in the kitchen and family room and to the outside, which is what we asked for. Jim Dow came over and said that he likes it, that it does fit the big blocky buttresses of the house and encouraged me to continue to “be bold”. I thought about it more over the weekend and then we had Todd from Olson Kundig come over to take a look and take photos to show Tom. Todd said the same thing, that it does work and we should continue. He then talked to Tom and Tom agreed. At that point, with people a lot smarter than me telling me I’m wrong, who am I to argue? It wouldn’t be the first or last time I’m wrong, but usually when I feel this uncomfortable about something, I discover that I was right to be uncomfortable. I’m still  not convinced, but we’re going ahead with the plan and I’m continuing to spend a lot of time staring at it trying to see the vision. Boy, I hope I’m wrong.</p>

            <p>We delivered gifts of wine and chocolate to neighbors whose property adjoins ours to thank them for putting up with construction for the last year and to apologize in advance for the noise coming tomorrow.</p>

<p>We met some new people. 2 people grew up in the DC area, 1 lives there half the year (all agreed it sucks!). We learned that Molly Moon herself, of <a href="http://www.mollymoonicecream.com/ice-cream-shops">Molly Moon</a> ice cream, lives on the next block. And while Gay was picking up the chocolate from the corporate office of <a href="http://www.franschocolates.com/store/home.php?xid=1ef6fecd8fb7a4bf75f32320e0469053">Fran’s Chocolate</a> this afternoon, learned some things while talking to Dylan, Fran’s son who she went to college with and who works at the company: Fran lives on the next block too so Dylan grew up in our neighborhood, her husband worked with the previous owner of this house many years ago, and Dylan remembered going trick-or-treating at our house as a kid. Small world.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>It’s been almost a month since we moved in and we’re still unpacking and there’s still people walking around the house finishing minor things. The weekends are nice when no one is here working, but I enjoy seeing the daily progress. I spent a couple days installing perforated aluminum in the garage walls. It looks like about what I expected and serves its purpose to be a smooth surface along the stairs, but I’m undecided about whether I like it.</p>

<p>The steel work has been done and redone several times. Almost every piece has been brought in and found to be incorrectly-sized or has the fastener holes in the wrong place and they take them back out to remake them. This has happened to both companies, not just one. We’ve been waiting for months for the sliding door handles and one of them arrived yesterday and it looked great and then it disappeared. Mark said it was 1/16” too narrow so they had to take it back and rebuild it. If these guys keep doing work for us, they’re going to go out of business!</p>

<p>After the backyard patio was removed and the ditches for the footings were dug, Westlake made the forms for the footings and those were poured. A couple days later, they started building the forms for the concrete walls, which takes much longer since the forms have to be perfectly aligned and the cone ties have to be placed where we want them for aesthetic reasons. This week, they poured the walls. Monday the forms should come off and we can see the walls and then the deck framing can begin.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, when Kelly is here and watching the kids at night, Gay and I went out to dinner to celebrate our 7th anniversary. We went to <a href="http://ethanstowellrestaurants.com/anchoviesandolives/">Anchovies &amp; Olives</a>, a restaurant by Seattle’s newest famous chef, Ethan Stowell. Aside from the aloof greeter, the service and food were wonderful. The food was in my top 10 of dining experiences, it’s been a while since I’ve been so impressed with a restaurant. And for the first time, I had a new cocktail that I’d order again and might try to make at home:</p>

<blockquote>Loathsome Bastard: Rye Whiskey, Ramazzotti, Strega, Blood Orange Bitters, Peach Bitters</blockquote>

<p>The restaurant is just a few minutes away by car. We’re still getting used to having so much stuff so nearby. We could’ve walked it in 25 minutes, which would have been a nice after-dinner walk.</p>

<p>Hudson’s been going to school on Tuesdays and Thursdays the last couple weeks and he’s loving it. Havana also had school just for the week this week, but Gay forgot until 45 minutes before she had to be there. She was supposed to bring an old piece of small furniture that she’d paint as the week’s project, but we weren’t prepared. Fortunately, we have a bunch of carpenters readily available. Mark and Tim quickly made a toy box out of some scrap wood for her and we made it to school with time to spare. She painted it blue with her name and stenciled animals on the sides. Very cute.</p>

            <p>Today is our 7th wedding anniversary. 7 years have passed, just like that. It’s been a good 7 years! I hope there’s many many more.</p>

<p>With everything going on lately, we keep forgetting about it and haven’t planned anything to celebrate tonight and didn’t get each other any gifts. Maybe we’ll go out Tuesday night to celebrate it when we get a chance with Kelly here to go out without the kids.</p>

            <p>It took just 78 days to sell the Vashon house. We signed the papers yesterday and it closed today. Gay’s dad and aunt are here visiting so they shared champagne with us to celebrate.</p>

<p>The first offer came in 3 weeks after it was on the market. It came from a law professor moving to Seattle from Portland and he was an ass from the start. His agent, who referred to him as “eccentric”, showed him 35 houses before he saw ours. He made a reasonable offer and then upon inspection, demanded an additional $40,000 off for idiotic things like repainting the entire house inside and outside, rebuilding every deck, tree-trimming, etc. We walked away from his offer once, he came back a few days later with a higher offer but a 6-hour time limit so we ignored him and let that expire and two days later he met our number. Two days after that, our agent called his agent wondering where the signed copy of the offer was and she said “he’s soured on the deal”. It seemed from the beginning that he couldn’t afford the place – he originally asked us to finance the deal, and the financing he eventually got was sketchy – so we were always wary that he’d be able to close. He was a bottom-feeder trying to get any house at the absolute lowest possible price and was just a pain in the ass to deal with. He drove his agent to tears at one point and our agent had to give her professional advice about dealing with bad clients.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a couple from Texas had come to Seattle and wanted to see our house the morning before we found out he changed his mind. We let them see it even though it was under contract, but once we found out that he wasn’t going to buy it after all, we called them and they came back for a second look that afternoon. They were much more pleasant and had 2 kids, which the house is suited for. We killed the deal with the idiot law professor and they made an offer the next day. Their agent almost screwed up the deal by providing bad information to them that took us weeks to correct, but we got through the inspection contingency and they hurried the close date and it was done in just a few weeks.</p>

<p>In the end, we think the price was still too low and they got a great deal. But we saved a lot when we bought the new house, so it’s a net positive to us.</p>
