              <p>The local elementary school has a Christmas Tree sale, so we ordered our tree, a Noble Fir, of course. We put it up and decorated it today. Both Havana and Hudson were very excited to put ornaments on it; that’s the first year they’ve done that. This is the earliest we’ve ever had our tree up too.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Gay and I went to see The National at The Neptune Theater last night. It was a late night for us too, we didn’t even leave the house until after 7:30pm, after watching all but the final minutes of the Seahawks beating of the Eagles. We stopped at the theater to pick up our tickets at will-call and to ask when they expect The National to go on – 10pm, so we had plenty of time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/6443579889/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7163/6443579889_d23c876f1e.jpg" alt="The National @ The Neptune" /></a></p>

<p>We went to Hudson Public Ale House, a place I’ve wanted to go to for years now just because of the name (that they have a good beer list is a coincidence, I’m sure). It was close enough to the U District and probably the closest we’d be to the place for a while, so we went.
<!-- more -->We both got the same thing: a burger with an egg on top, a relatively new treat for us. They had good beers on the beer list, most of which we’d not had or even heard of, which is rare for us. I couldn’t resist Maritime’s Jolly Roger, being Christmas-y time of year and one of my favorite Christmas beers that is not often found on tap. Gay got Sound Brewing’s <a href="http://www.soundbrewery.com/beers.php#">Humulo Nimbus, Double IPA</a>. After dinner, we still had time so we shared the <a href="http://oakbrew.com/2010/10/14/ill-tempered-gnome/">Oakshire Ill-Tempered Gnome</a>, another winter seasonal, before we left for the show.</p>

<p>I discovered The National randomly searching for something else and immediately loved the 2007 album <em>Boxer</em>. I’ll always remember that album as my and Havana’s first band we shared… when I was left to take care of her when she was just a couple months old, I had the hardest time getting her to calm down when she was crying, partly because she wanted mommy and because I had no idea what I was doing. But I found that she always stopped crying and listened when she heard the opening piano in their song “Fake Empire”. It quickly became my trick and I would rock her in my arms listening to the album, as if I was dancing with her. Those songs still bring back those memories for me.</p>

<p>We got home just before midnight and, after letting the nanny go, immediately went to bed.</p>

    <p>I’m thankful that I spend morning, noon and night with Gay every day and yet I want to spend more time with her. I’m thankful for her and for her willingness to be in my life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My kids who teach me over and over how much I love being alive. They also teach me over and over that I must continually improve myself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our house. For the first time in my life, I feel like I live in a home. And I’m thankful that I got to be so involved in its renovation and had so much fun doing it working with great people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Pacific Northwest. I am thankful that I get to live in one of the most beautiful, and reasonably-populated, places in the world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am thankful that I had the opportunity to pursue my life’s dreams and to shape my life the way I wanted to. And even more thankful that I still have that freedom.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m healthy; I’m thankful for the knowledge that one day I won’t be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beer. It’s the icing on the cake for me and I (usually) don’t drink as much of it as I’d like to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Programming. It’s exercise for my brain that I’ve enjoyed for a lifetime. I feel like a kid when I get to write code and solve new little problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My home gym. I wouldn’t exercise if it weren’t for convenient access to exercise equipment. It’s my daily addiction. And I’m thankful specifically for the specific equipment I have that makes exercise fun.</p>

    <p>My doctors at PacMed. My life today (and tomorrow) is better because of them.</p>

              <p>Eva is 11 months old today. She’s still a great baby, only cries when she’s hungry or frustrated. She sleeps well and very regularly. And she eats very well — she loves eggs and has no nut allergies.</p>

<p>She’s not yet walking on her own but she uses a walker really well in straight lines. She still crawls very quickly amd loves getting around the house. She says “Maaa maaaa” now and laughs all the time.</p>

<p>Hudson and Havana are good baby-sitters too, warning us when she gets near the stairs and blocking her. Hudson really seems to like her; he sits with her and plays with her, hugs her, etc.</p>

              <p>Fall is my favorite time of year: temperatures are a little cooler, you can smell fireplaces in the air, the leaves turn colors, the best beers of the year start coming out, Halloween, my birthday and my favorite holiday (Thanksgiving) arrives, football is on, and it’s lighter in the morning and darker earlier and the light just feels better to me.</p>

<p>I took this photo while out walking around the neighborhood. I wish I took a photo of the red leaves up ahead, they were so bright red on one side and pink on the other, it looked like Valentine’s Day. Havana would’ve loved it.</p>
