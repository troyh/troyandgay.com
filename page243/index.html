        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Our office remodel has begun today. “Ron”:http://www.mitchellcontractors.com/ woke us up at 8am on the button with his crew to start the demolition. The wall that divided the office is coming out to create one large room instead of two small rooms. And the small windows are being replaced with two much larger windows. The electrician also came today to scope out the electrical work, which will give us lots more electrical outlets and a bunch of ethernet taps, so we can have less cablign running around the room. Hopefully, it’ll all be done in three weeks.</p>

<p>The wall broken down to the studs:

<p>The wall completely gone and the drywall taken off the outside wall:

          <p>We were invited by our friends at Wells Fargo to “Wells Fargo Day” at “Qwest field”:http://www.seahawks.com/stadium.aspx?SecID=31 to see the “Seahawks”:http://www.seahawks.com/default.aspx?SecID=3 game. We got to sit in the Wells Fargo clubhouse, which means free beer &amp; wine, a heated room with movie-theater seating. The stadium is new and much much much better than the old “Kingdome”:http://www.metrokc.gov/stadium/ it replaced. The Seahawks ended a three-game losing streak by beating the Panthers, 23-17.</p>

          <p>This shocked me… the guy who runs “Electoral-Vote.com”:http://www.electoral-vote.com/ announced who he was today and he is none other than <em>the</em> “Andrew Tanenbaum”:http://www.electoral-vote3.com/info/votemaster-faq.html! All computer science students know who he is (or, they should!) – he’s the author of a couple textbooks on operating systems and is the creator of “Minix”:http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/minix.html#whatisminix, the precursor to Linux. Small world. :)</p>

<p>And I love his reason for making Electoral-Vote.com: <em>“In a nutshell, because living abroad I know first hand what the world thinks of America and it is not a pretty picture at the moment. I want people to think of America as the land of freedom and democracy, not the land of arrogance and blind revenge. I want to be proud of America again.”</em></p>

<p>Me too. Vote tomorrow!</p>
