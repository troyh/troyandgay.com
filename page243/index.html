They didn’t finish the window trim and a little of the wall trim so they’ll be back tomorrow. And because the electricians put the outlets too high on the wall below the windows, they had to make really ugly cutouts to go around them. They were supposed to be flush-mounted on the trim but Ron didn’t explain that to the electricians so now we have the ugliest wall outlets in town (see inset). We’re going to have a talk with Ron about a solution to this…</p>

<p>We’re also still trying to decide on colors. Melinda, who is an ex-interior designer, came over last night and helped us pick out some colors, of which there are samples you can see painted on the walls.</p>

<p>After tomorrow and once we decide on paint, we can start painting. Then it’s just flooring (carpet) installation and put the plates on the electrical outlets and getting the wall heaters installed. My guess is that we can move in mid-December six weeks after the “two-week” project started.</p>

              <p><img src="http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=60034572&amp;trkid=14" alt="" />Finally saw <em>Shrek 2</em> this weekend but we didn’t like it as much as the first one. The story just wasn’t as entertaining. The cultural references weren’t that striking, as many reviews said. Yeah, it was cute that the fast food place was named “Fryar’s” and Far Far Away Land was obviously Los Angeles.</p>

<p>We watched the extras on the DVD and about how much more advanced technically than the first one, but you know what? I didn’t even notice. I wasn’t amazed that the characters got stuck in a rain shower and got drenched, something “never before done” in a computer-animated movie. All I remember about that scene was thinking “what was the purpose of that rain shower?”</p>

<p>It was entertaining and funny and worth watching, but I really liked the first movie and this one didn’t do it for me as much.</p>

              <p>We run a <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com">recipe web site</a> which means our busiest time of year is during the run up to the big holidays, so our celebrations are always delayed now.  I have to admit, I’m beginning to like it.  We’re going to our friends’ John &amp; Deborah’s on Thursday, so we get to have dinner without getting stressed about making it to the grocery store tomorrow.  We’re having other friends out here for turkey on Saturday night.  We can cook while the rest of the world Christmas shops.  I’ve only <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/mycookbook/book/30270/">started collecting recipes to choose from for a menu today</a>.  Thanksgiving is still my favorite holiday, and I am really looking forward to sharing it with our close friends, even if a few days late.</p>

              <p>We dropped Illy off at the vet this morning to have a mole removed from her lip. She developed it this summer and on her last checkup, the vet recommended that it be removed. We just got back from picking her up. She’s groggy from the anesthesia, but otherwise looks great. Ouzo doesn’t seem to care that she’s back home.</p>
