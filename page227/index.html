          <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/desertfox.jpg" alt="desert fox" />One of my relatives is in Iraq (I’m being vague because you really aren’t supposed to talk about where anyone in the military is or what they are doing, even though he is civilian, it seems safer).  This is a picture of a fox he spies every day on his lunch walk.  You can see the base airport in the background.  He’ll only be there for a few months, and thanks to email and digital cameras he is still quite close to home.  I’m really thankful for this picture (instead of the suicide bombing last week), because when I read the news and think of him, I can think of him on his walks, following the growth of this desert fox and her cubs. </p>

        <article>
          <p>In an effort to preserve our own sanity, we’ve instituted a voluntary 72 hour television boycott this week in an effort to prevent even a glimpse of a painful Bush sound bite.  As a result, we also missed the, I’m assuming, under-covered protests as well.  <a href="http://centricle.com/photos/2005/01/21/">Great photos here</a> and <a href="http://andiamnotlyingforreal.blogspot.com/2005/01/protest-sign-gallery.html">great signs</a> make me proud we have a country founded on free speech.  Four years seems like a mighty long time right now.</p>

          <p>We went to <a href="http://seattle.citysearch.com/profile/41542429/seattle_wa/crow.html?cslink=roundup_name_noncust&amp;ulink=roundup__roundupentity1-3_1__0_profile_2_1">Crow</a> last night for dinner after visiting <a href="http://www.internap.com/">Internap</a>’s Open House at the <a href="http://www.fisherplaza.com/">Fisher Plaza</a>. They have a very impressive facility.</p>

<p>The food at Crow was good but the wait staff was a bit on the surly side. Because we were late for our reservation, we had to sit at the food bar, which is pretty nice as you get to watch the chefs prepare your food. I had a braised duck and Gay had the lamb shank. Both were excellent. And the prices are moderate.</p>

I don’t imagine this will sway Lance to ride in the Tour this year. The French authorities just don’t want to accept that he’s not doping. It must suck to work hard, be successful and have to listen to losers criticize your every move.</p>
