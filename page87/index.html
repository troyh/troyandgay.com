          </h3>
            <p>Gay had her 3rd Mother’s Day today. We were all tired because I went to a Bachelor Party last night and Gay got the kids up at 1am to come pick me up (as planned, not because I was stranded somewhere embarrassing in a drunken stupor). So we didn’t get to bed until 2am and got up at 6am with Havana.

<p>I got her a few books and the kids chipped in and got her a new camera to replace the one she got two years ago for Mother’s Day, which broke a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>The weather was great. I got the hammock stand out of the garage, put it together with help from Havana and Hudson, and got some use out of it for the first time this year. Gay took Havana to her afternoon dance recital and Hudson and I hung out in the hammock for a while. Later, Reid and Mark stopped by on their way home from the Bachelor Party to return my jacket I left there and we had a couple beers in the backyard. It was a relaxing day.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Havana had her first dance recital tonight. She’d been going to rehearsal for a few weeks, something parents weren’t allowed in to see. After about 45 minutes, Havana made her debut.</p>

<p>We had to leave at intermission so Gay could drop me off at Reid’s bachelor party at his dad’s cabin on the island. There I saw some Jon, Mark, Peter and Reid’s brother who I hadn’t seen in a long time as well as Mark and Reid, of course. I was late but they saved me the biggest steak I’ve ever seen, that was perfectly-cooked.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We celebrated Havana’s birthday today. We invited a bunch of her friends from her preschool and their parents, Jon &amp; Megan and Steve &amp; Renuka and their kids, Owen and Claire. We rented a bouncy house for the day which the kids loved and had snacks, cake, beer and wine. And the cake was delicious.</p>

<p>The slide in the house also got a lot of use by the kids and there was only one injury.</p>

<p>Jon, Megan, Steve, Renuka, Owen and Claire stayed late and the kids watched Pixar’s <em>Cars</em> quietly while we had dinner (that we ate after dessert!).</p>

            <p>Havana turned 3 today. Tomorrow is her party.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4568439727/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4031/4568439727_c09448f13e.jpg" alt="IMG_5515" /></a></p>

<p>While running this morning with my iPod on random, this song came on and I couldn’t help but think of Havana on her birthday:</p>

<blockquote>What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all 'round the sun

What a beautiful dream
That could flash on the screen
In a blink of an eye and be gone from me
Soft and sweet
Let me hold it close and keep it here with me

And one day we will die
And our ashes will fly
From the aeroplane over the sea
But for now we are young
Let us lay in the sun
And count every beautiful thing we can see</blockquote>

<p>As an adult, it’s easy to forget how short life is and how you don’t even know  how much time you have. Kids haven’t yet learned to think about time, the past or the future so they enjoy <em>now</em>. I hope both our kids never lose that.</p>

<p>Havana, I hope you’re as happy and have as much fun at 30 as you do at 3.</p>

            <p>The New York Times has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/magazine/25national-t.html">an article</a> about the making of <a href="http://americanmary.com/index.php">The National</a>’s new album and they’re streaming the entire album today through Tuesday. The single, “Bloodbuzz Ohio”, is <a href="http://www.highviolet.com/">available free for download</a> too. I’ve been waiting almost 3 years, since their brilliant album “Boxer”, for their next album. Just 18 more days to wait.</p>
