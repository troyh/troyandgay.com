<p>Mostly I just thought this quote was funny…</p>

<p>Mr. Perlman says he wrote a note to Steve Ballmer, then ‘s No. 2 man and now its chief executive officer, complaining about technical glitches in Office’s Outlook e-mail product. Mr. Perlman had been testing the product because  wanted WebTV employees to switch to Outlook after  acquired WebTV, Mr. Perlman recalls.A manager in the Office group who responded to the note on Mr. Ballmer’s behalf was “outraged” at the complaint about Outlook, Mr. Perlman says. The manager wrote back, “My job is not making Outlook reliable. My job is killing Lotus Notes,” a competing product sold by IBM, Mr. Perlman says.</p>
