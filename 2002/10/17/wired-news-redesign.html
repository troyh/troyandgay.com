    <p><a href="http://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2002/wired-interview/">An Interview With Douglas Bowman of Wired News</a>. Page layout without tables!:  <em>By eliminating tables that were strictly used for layout, we significantly cut back on the amount of markup and useless tags in our html, and gained a structure that is much easier to maintain. Now that the content is not locked into a specific table structure, we have much more flexibility in how we present that content. A few changes to the CSS can completely alter the presentation of thousands of pages. As a very welcome side benefit, we also believe the accessibility of Wired News will dramatically improve without the clutter of nested layout tables.</em></p>
