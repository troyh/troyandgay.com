  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Went into Seattle to meet with John Bender at Holland &amp; Knight. John has much better credentials than Jeff Thomas and was recommended by two other well-regarded lawyers (Chris Wells and Frank Huebner). It went very well; John is very experienced and smart, plus his assistant, David Ebel, is also smart.</p>

<p>Now, how do I tell Jeff Thomas we wonâ€™t be needing his services?</p>
