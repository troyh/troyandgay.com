    <p>We left early Thanksgiving morning for Florida.  Car &gt; Ferry &gt; Shuttle &gt; Subway &gt; Airplane &gt; Monorail &gt; Car we arrived at Troy’s parents house 3,000 miles away 12 hours later. We had Thanksgiving dinner with Troy’s mom, dad, aunt Lorna, brother and sister-in-law on Friday. Saturday we took a driving tour of the area (deftly avoiding the mall), bought a digital camera and then experienced the best of Ocalla dining and entertainment.  “The Villages” is a fully manufactured Southwest style shopping center and square.  With free entertainment every night in the square and 2-for-1 drinks, who’s complaining?  That night we continued the party til 3a…  Sunday we just hung around the house and watched football.</p>
