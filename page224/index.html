            <p><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/mstamper77/CoolStuff%20folder/CoolStuff/">Gui Avoider</a> explains why they are more productive on a Mac. I have to agree, as a long-time Mac-hater (I still think pre-OS X Macs sucked), the first thing that struck me about OS X is that I think about what I’m doing rather than how I’m doing it. Windows and Linux GUIs are both so difficult to use that I find myself struggling with the tool rather than getting the job done. OS X is a pleasure to use, and I don’t say that about many tech products.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Several weeks ago, we started using <a href="http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/">Ganglia</a> to monitor all our servers. And I’m glad I did. For years we used a home-made system built on <a href="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/sebastien.godard/">sysstat</a> and <a href="http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/">RRDTool</a> and it served its purpose, but then I discovered Ganglia. Our old system gave us performance statistics on a 10-minute delay but Ganglia is almost live, which is very helpful to see what’s happening <em>now</em>. It’s also much easier to setup, just apt-get ganglia-monitor, edit the /etc/gmond.conf file (if necessary) and a new server is being monitored. It’s that easy (if you use <a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a>).</p>

<p>Ganglia was originally funded by the place I interned for while in college (and, not coincidentally, my dad’s employer for 25 years), the <a href="http://nsf.gov">National Science Foundation</a>. That’s good government at work! :)</p>

          </h3>
            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/IMG_2441.JPG" alt="IMG_2441.JPG" />We just bought a small Anthro cart to put a workstation on and I’m so impressed with it that I have to write about it….</p>

<p>I ordered <a href="http://www.anthro.com/PromotionDetails.asp?PromotionID=287">the cart</a> on a Sunday evening. The next day I got a call from the company asking me if my order was correct because I ordered one color for the table top and a different color for the second pull-out shelf (It was a bug on their web site that didn’t let me choose the color I wanted). But to call me instead of automatically shipping me what I ordered is impressive customer service. And she did fix my order to get the same colors on both shelves.</p>

<p>The package was delivered three days later and I began setting it up. Right away, I noticed how Anthro is all about quality. The parts weren’t just thrown into a box, the packaging is specially-made for each part and well organized inside the box.</p>

<p>The instructions were simple and easy to follow with numbers identifying each of the five types of screws – no guessing between the “3/4” wood screw” and the “3/4” machine screw”. I had it all set up in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The parts are all top quality stuff too… the welds are all well-done, the finish on the metal poles is uniform and attractive, the casters are the equivalent of truck tires and they roll very smoothly, the slide-out shelf is on ball-bearings with an easy-to-use locking mechanism, and the laminated surface and edge is very professional. And they include attractive end caps to finish off the post ends. The total package screams quality.</p>

<p>To assemble it, they also provide the tools you need. And these tools aren’t just the cheap Ikea-style allen wrench. It includes a nice screwdriver and, get this, a screwdriver drill bit in case you have a power drill, and a rubber mallet just to put the end caps on.</p>

<p>All of this for $289. Amazing. I’m trying to find another reason to buy an Anthro cart. :)</p>
