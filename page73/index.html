          <p>It took us 2 hours to get over to Seattle today because of ferry delays due to morning fog. Hey Vashon bridge opponents: a bridge always runs on time!</p>

<p>We stopped at the house to do some measurements on the garage and we walked around a bit in the house. The asbestos abatement company is doing their work this week, so nothing much else is going on.</p>

<p>We made a quick stop at Swedish medical center for Gay to give blood for a study they’re doing on pregnancy and migraines – she doesn’t have migraines, she’s in the control group. Side note: During the last pregnancy, she gave blood for a study trying to see if it was possible to identify and extract baby’s cells from the mother’s blood rather than from the amniotic fluid. It turns out the work was successful so, in a few years, the dangerous method of poking a big needle into a pregnant woman’s stomach will be a thing of the past. Very cool.</p>

<p>We then went to the interior designer’s office to see what they’ve picked out for the house. As usual, they did a great job. We wanted them to try to maintain the style of the house but have a more contemporary look and feel. Ideally, the house would look more like a modern version of the original rather than an old house that was obviously remodeled. Hard to do, especially when you also want modern conveniences and appliances. They picked “subway tile” for our bathroom to recreate the original white tiles of the time, but they look just slightly more modern. I love that. They also picked out some great marble hexagon tiles for the kids’ bathroom that look very much like the original tile that was there, but marble. The marble for the master bathroom and kitchen island looks very classic. They picked a dark wood for cabinetry throughout the house so match the dark wood that already exists in the house. They picked a very cool dark kitchen tile floor with rough edges – it looks very old and worn – and a nice granite for the kitchen counters. They had a great idea for the wood from the Monkey Trees on the powder room counter, which could look amazing. The fixtures for all the sinks is a little up in the air. They picked nice ones, but they’re expensive <a href="http://www.dornbracht.com/en/">Dornbracht</a> fixtures, and we just don’t love them enough to justify the cost. They also picked all the sinks in the kitchen and bathrooms and the back splash for the butler’s pantry.</p>

          <p>Great “article on Meyer-Wells”:http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/business/energy-environment/08sustain.html?_r=3 in the NY Times on Saturday. 4 or 5 years ago, they did two fireplace mantles, the casework for our bookshelf in our bedroom and a really cool side table that we put our drinks on every night. Glad to see their business is doing well. We’re talking to them about making something out of the Monkey Puzzle Trees we’re going to take down. They’ve never worked with wood from a Monkey Puzzle Tree so they’re excited about it. I hope we can turn those hideous things into something beautiful.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Kelly worked today to watch the kids so we could go to Megan’s 40th Birthday Party tonight. We stopped at the grocery store to pick up beer, our assignment for the party. I got some good beers too, that was the best beer selection at a party I’ve been to in a long time! :) Gay made a fruit salad, a pasta salad and crab cakes. Jon bbq’d a salmon and brought the cake. Mary and Melanie made bbq’d corn and had a bunch of appetizers and wine out.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>As usual, we had to leave early to catch a reasonable ferry back so Kelly could go home. We can’t move back into the city soon enough.</p>

<p>More proof we live in a small world: The party was at Mary &amp; Melanie’s house, friends of Megan, and Mary went to law school with the youngest kid of the people who we bought our house from. She even had been to the house to study a few times in the 90s. They still keep in touch and figured out, independently of us, that the family sold the house to us. What are the odds of that?</p>

<p>She told her that the previous offer on the house a year earlier was from an older woman who wanted it as a second home that she’d use while visiting Seattle. The family didn’t like that. I think the deal fell apart over price, but she said they were much happier that we are going to live there full-time and raise kids there.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>We got our almost-final schematic drawings for the house done. We hadn’t had a design for the offices and guest room in the attic that we liked yet. Dan and Todd (Olson Kundig) got help from Tom and now looks pretty good. The whole design needs just minor edits (moving a door here, rotating a toilet there) and we feel great about it. Now we need to think about what we’re going to do with the garage.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>We’ve been working on the windows and insulation decision. The windows are all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muntin">muntin</a>-free and all are encasements, not single- or double-hung, so that’s great for preventing leaks. The windows are all in great condition, considering their age, so the window contractor suggested repairing the existing windows where necessary rather than replacing them with modern windows. I like this because it’s much cheaper to repair than to replace them. Plus, original windows look better than modern windows.</p>

<p>All the windows are single-pane, which aren’t as good as dual-pane for insulation, but dual-pane windows aren’t all that much better insulation-wise and they don’t last as long as single-pane windows. 20 years is about the lifespan of a dual-pane window and the windows in our current house are proving that.</p>

<p>All the walls in the house lack insulation, which wasn’t popular until the original US energy crisis in the 1970s. Insulation is great for lowering the heating bill, but terrible for the longevity of the house. Insulated walls prevent the walls from breathing so condensation that forms inside walls stays and, of course, water is the enemy of wood so the wood rots. This is one reason modern houses don’t last as long as older houses – the wood deteriorates more quickly in modern homes. Water is also bad for insulation, so over time, the insulation breaks down, stops insulating as well and requires replacement.</p>

<p>We have to decide whether saving on the heating bill is more important than preventing rot in the house’s structure. I’d like the house to last another 100 years, so I’d prefer to not be the people who started the deterioration of the house. The contractors suggested a happy medium: only insulating the bedroom exterior walls to keep the bedrooms warmer at night. The 2nd floor is also easier to insulate because the first floor has a lot of great old wood trim on the walls that we don’t want to disturb. The house has radiant heating, which is about as efficient as you can get already, so it’d take even longer to make insulating the walls cost-effective. I’m not even sure it’s necessary comfort-wise. Seattle rarely gets very cold and people have lived in the house for 100 years, so how cold could the house get?</p>

<p>The biggest cause of heat loss is infiltration (leaks in the envelope of the house) and heat lost through the roof. So we’ll plug all the leaks and insulate the attic ceiling and get the biggest energy-efficiencies that way. We need to do more research before we make a decision on insulating the walls.</p>

        <article>
          <p>After Gay’s <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/08/04/baby-3-20-week-ultrasound/">ultrasound</a> appointment, we went to the new house for our weekly progress report. It’s so nice being in the city where you can get from one appointment to another in a few minutes!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4861779247/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4861779247_ee1abfc58c.jpg" alt="Kids' bathroom" /></a></p>

<p>The demolition is progressing nicely. The kitchen/family room is almost completely gutted. It’s amazing how well wood that is 100+ years old holds up (if it doesn’t get wet!), the wood behind the walls still looks almost new. The only reason you can tell which are newer studs is that modern studs are 2x4-inch and the old ones are bigger and more rough. They continue to be amazed at how well-built the house is. For example, the studs are all 12 inches apart, most houses, especially of that age, had much farther-spaced studs. The original owner didn’t skimp.</p>

<p>They discovered that the old knob and tube fuse box was left in the house because they used it as a junction box for outlets connected to it. That’s going to take some work to undo. For the first time, now that the walls are down, we can get an idea about the size of the kitchen and family room.</p>

<p>The partition walls in the basement are mostly down to studs now and one wall is removed so we have a better sense of the space there. Part of the basement floor is 2 inches lower than the rest and we can’t figure out why. We talked about options to level it throughout the basement.</p>

<p>The kids’ bathroom upstairs is down to studs. We discovered that the plumbing drain that serves the attic bathroom goes through the ceiling so moving the bathroom in the attic to the east side of the house will require plumbing in the ceiling of the kids’ bathroom. This means that the ceiling will be a foot lower to accommodate the drain. I’m not that happy about that, but it could just lower part of the ceiling over the shower and toilet, so it wouldn’t be that noticeable. Or maybe it could be an exposed pipe?</p>

<p>A problem for our current design for the master bath is that the joists in the ceiling run east-west and we expected them to run north-south. This means that the wall we assumed was load-bearing isn’t and the wall we assumed wasn’t load-bearing is. We’ve been working with new designs for the bathroom to account for this.</p>

<p>We left the house, grabbed pizza from Zeek’s on the way home and made the 5:40p ferry. A pretty quick trip into the city and back.</p>
