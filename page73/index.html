          </h3>
            <p>Gay went to the architect to pick up the drawings and then to the Seattle DPD to try to get our permit for the the garage and she got it. The garage was excluded from the house building permit that <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/09/02/we-got-our-permit/">we got weeks ago</a> because we had to prove that the garage really did exist when the house was built, that the changes aren’t a change-of-use and that we are making the right structural changes to it.</p>

<p>Two parts of government bureaucracy down and one to go!</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Gay’s dad and aunts met us at the hotel restaurant for breakfast before we drove home. We were on the road by 11am, stopped in Ellensburg for lunch and were home on the 4pm ferry. The kids were good the entire drive, as usual, but Havana was sick of her car seat by the time we got the ferry dock and complained about having to get back in it to drive on the ferry. By 4:30 we were watching the 10am Steelers game on the DVR. A good end to a day of long driving.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Today’s Jimmy &amp; Jessica’s wedding day. We got the kids dressed, went to Costco to get some Champagne and fruit so Gay could make a fruit salad. We fought the Spokane traffic to get to Gay’s dad’s house where Gay assembled the fruit salad. Then we were off to Deer Park to Gay’s mom’s farm for the wedding.</p>

<p>We met Jessica for the first time. The kids found tractors to climb on and some animals to look at before the wedding. The ceremony was short and then we had dinner. We opened a bottle of champagne and tried to share it, but that went over like a lead balloon. It wasn’t a champagne crowd. The kids played with some other kids and danced the night away in the barn.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We were on our way out of Seattle to Spokane a little after 11am. We got there a little before 4pm and checked into the hotel, <a href="http://www.thedavenporthotel.com/">The Davenport</a>. The Davenport was <em>the</em> hotel in Spokane’s hey-day, went abandoned for many years and was restored about 10 years ago.</p>

<p>Gay’s dad and aunts came to the hotel to meet us and we had cocktails in the lobby restaurant before dinner. We then took a walk around downtown Spokane, happening upon the eve of the grand opening of a new Apple Store. As usual for Apple events, there were a couple guys waiting in line for the 10am opening the next day – Spokane has weirdos who like to wait in line for no reason too. Whodathunkit that Spokane would get an Apple store?!? Either Spokane is growing or Apple is now that mainstream (I think the latter).</p>

<p>We walked to the Davenport Hotel’s newer hotel, The Davenport Tower, which is really just across the street from the original and had dinner there in the Safari Room.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Gay’s brother is getting married this tomorrow in Spokane. We took the 9am ferry, stopped at <a href="http://www.metamarbleandgranite.com/">Meta Marble</a> to look at some marble samples that the designers like and then we went to the house to check on the progress (after another stop at Top Pot Doughnuts). The master bedroom/bathroom framing is basically done, the kids’ bathroom wall is framed and a new header has been put in place, one of the walls in a kids’ room is re-framed because a door was moving and the plumbers upgraded the 3/4” water line from the street with a 1 1/4” pipe.</p>
