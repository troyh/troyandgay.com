              <p>Gay, Eva and I took the 9am ferry to go back to the house. We were meeting Katie and Jim (and Mark, who is always there) to talk budget, schedule and get Jim’s advice on a few things. I was also able to install some more blocking in the basement and did a better job this time (I think).</p>

<p>I also got Mark and Colin, who is
framing the garage interior, to put my trapdoor in the garage floor again, which we had nixed from the plans months ago. This will give me easy access to the top of the Jeep for loading and unloading.</p>

<p>Mark also gave me a couple Schuchart/Dow shirts, making me an honorary carpenter.</p>

              <p>Eva is 1 month old today. She’s a good baby so far, she cries even less than Hudson did, I think (and much much less than Havana did!). She’s growing well and has gained almost a pound and a half.</p>

              <p>When we got home yesterday, Hudson’s eye was pink and infected and he had a fever. It looked like <a href="https://health.google.com/health/ref/Conjunctivitis">pink eye</a>. The pediatrician wanted to get a look at him to see if he had an ear infection or even strep throat, so we scheduled an appointment for today so I decided to go with and do more work at the house. This morning, he looked much better but we went anyway. He’s fine, no ear infection or strep throat.</p>

<p>Gay dropped me off at the house and I got a couple hours to hang out and put up some blocking in the basement. Hudson got to spend some time with us without Havana around too. He’s almost a different person when Havana’s not taking all the attention.</p>

              <p>Eva had a doctor’s visit and Gay was going to meet Nancy and My to pick out the actual slabs (as opposed to getting a random one based on samples) of marble and granite. So I decided to go in with her and work at the house again.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Today, I pulled some lathe &amp; plaster off the south wall of our offices so I could run some cable into our offices. After that, I tidied up cable I had run in the attic crawl space and in the master bedroom. Then I got some training with the nail gun and put some blocking in the sauna wall, preparing for the sauna installation.</p>

<p>The drywall guys started preparing the studs for the drywall. They make the studs square and flat because wood bends soon after it’s used. They do this with planers and shims to make sure all the planes of the walls are flat. This makes the finished walls flat and even. I doubt any house I’ve lived in had this done!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the other Schuhart/Dow guys were starting the framing in the garage. That’s the last of the framing and rough carpentry work.</p>

<p>The plumbing and HVAC have passed inspection. The electrical work is behind schedule and it doesn’t look like it will be done for a few more days. The drywall can’t go up until that is done and passes inspection. My low
voltage work is done and shouldn’t be a problem for the electrical inspection, but you never know how strict the inspector will be.</p>
