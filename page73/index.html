              <p>We visited Twisted Metalworks and then <a href="http://www.12thavenueiron.com/">12th Avenue Iron</a> to meet the metal fabricators for the metal work in the house. 12th Avenue Iron has a very cool shop (with an office designed by Tom Kundig) and is in our neighborhood on Capitol Hill.</p>

<p>One or both of them will do steel shelving in the kitchen and family room, steel cladding on the office sliding wall and pantry barn door, steel plating on the pantry shelving, steel cladding on the basement stair risers and the steel wall and handrail for the basement stairs, steel plating on our bathroom vanity cabinetry and around the doorways, door pulls on the barn doors and, possibly, a wall-mounted bottle opener in the butler’s pantry.</p>

              <p>We met with the other Troy, from <a href="http://www.legacyrenovation.com/">Legacy Renovation</a> who is repairing the existing windows, and Katie and Mark, from Schuchart/Dow, to talk about the windows and screens.  They had put screens in two windows to show us what they look like and we hated them – ugly and permanent –  so we wanted to talk about custom screens that would look better and be removed when not needed. He described how they’d work and look and they should be much better, so he’s going to work up an estimate for them. They’ll be more expensive, of course, but we only need them on the bedroom windows. We also talked about his shop drawing for the new window in the kitchen – looks good – and hardware on the windows.</p>

<p>Then we talked to Tim from the HVAC people to talk about locations for thermostats. There will be 7 (!) thermostats in the house: one for the radiators throughout the house, one for the kitchen + family room in-floor radiant heat, one for the basement in-floor radiant heat, two for  the radiators in our offices, one for the radiant floor in the master bedroom and one for the 2nd kids’ bathroom radiant floor. Some thermostats have remote sensors now, so we can locate the thermostat where it’s hidden (there’s no such thing as a good-looking thermostat) and have a remote sensor installed almost invisibly in the walls. So, except in our offices where there is no place to hide them, all the thermostats will be hidden from view.</p>

<p>Then we walked around with Bill, the electrician, to double-check switch and outlet locations. We didn’t make many significant changes except we decided to control the two walkways to the bathroom from the master bedroom independently. We also agreed with the lighting guy about adding two can lights in the dining room to light the table better.</p>

<p>The roofing guys were finishing up the skylights and this was the first time we got to see the attic with all the skylights in. Even on the cloudy day the attic felt almost like it had no roof on it at all. I’m really happy with the amount of light in there now, but now I’m concerned that it will get <em>too much</em> light and be too hot in the summer. I hope we can get good airflow from the ceiling fans and open windows up there. I also have to admit that I was wrong and Tom Kundig was right about how the cross-ties there will look – the light from above really shows off the grain in the wood and they look a lot more interesting than I was expecting. They should stand out even more once the pitched roof is drywalled and painted.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>I thought it would take me 2 days to do the low-voltage rough-in work at the house. 4 weeks later, I was done. I only got to work for half days because I had to travel via ferry each way and I took the week Eva was born off. It ended up taking me 10 half-days, so 5 full days.</p>

<p>Now I have to work on selecting speakers and go back after the drywall is up, probably 8 weeks from now, to install them. Then the painters can paint the grills. After painting is done, I can finish the “trim-out” (putting receptacles and wall plates in) anytime after the house is painted. I’ll also install ladder racks in the basement for the cable runs along the ceiling then.</p>

<p>Since the line-voltage electrical is still going on, I may go back and run a few more speaker wires since the walls are open and it’s easy to do.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p><strong>The National <em>High Violet</em></strong></p>

<p>If the Great American Novel had a soundtrack, I think this would be it. This is not only one of my favorite albums of 2010, but one of my favorite albums in my life, ranking up there with Rush’s “Moving Pictures”, Nirvana’s “Nevermind” and Radiohead’s “OK Computer”, albums I played on repeat for a long time and still listen to today. It sounds like cut-and-dried rock on the first several listens, but there’s a lot of subtlety and odd changing drum beats, which always hook me and I really like his voice. Favorites: it’s a perfect album so all songs are great, but “Sorrow”, “Little Faith”, “Afraid of Everyone”, “Conversation 16” and “England” are especially good.</p>

<p><strong>Jonsi <em>Go</em></strong></p>

<p>This is the solo album from one of the founders of Sigur Ros, an Icelandic band that we like. This album is more approachable than Sigur Ros and more pop-oriented, but still good and has that Sigur Ros atmospheric sound. Favorites: “Animal Arithmetic”, “Tornado”, “Boy Lilikoi”, “Kolnidur”, “Grow Till Tall”, “Hengilas”.</p>

<p><strong>Belle &amp; Sebastian <em>Write About Love</em></strong></p>

<p>It’s an alternative cliché, I guess, to like Belle &amp; Sebastian and I look like an aging art school nerd for holding onto this band for all these years, but I can’t help liking them. I think this is their best album since their 2000 album, “Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like A Peasant”.  Favorites: “I Didn’t See It Coming”, “Calculating Bimbo”, “I Want The World To Stop”, “Read The Blessed Pages”.</p>

<p><strong>Arcade Fire <em>Suburbs</em></strong></p>

<p>Their first album in 2004, “Funeral”, was amazing and it’s taken them this long to make something as good. I think their albums run together as one long song so it’s hard to pick out individual songs, but I’ll try: “The Suburbs”, “Modern Man”, “City With No Children”,  ”Half Light II”, “Suburban War”, “We Used To Wait”, “Sprawl II”.</p>

<p><strong>Gorillaz <em>Plastic Beach</em></strong></p>

<p>I generally don’t like rap and hip-hop, but if Damon Albarn makes it, I like it. I even like the Snoop Dogg track, which I would’ve guessed would be impossible. Favorites: “Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach”, “Rhinestone Eyes”, “Stylo”, “Empire Ants”, “Broken”, “Plastic Beach”, “On Melancholy Hill”.</p>
