          </h3>
            <p>There is someone who works at the Associated Press, probably more than one!, that makes a decision about which news stories are important enough to be an alert for mobile users. And they decided that Oprah’s imminent announcement to end her show in 2 years is worthy:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4118700382/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2475/4118700382_96135a13e5_o.jpg" alt="AP thinks this is critical news" /></a></p>

<p>I can’t decide if this is dumber than their alert about <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/10/09/ap-mobile-notifications/">golf in the 2016 Olympics</a>. Does this even merit an alert if you work for Oprah and will lose your job in 2011?</p>

<p>They accept (and seem to ignore) feedback at <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#109;&#110;&#110;&#102;&#101;&#101;&#100;&#098;&#097;&#099;&#107;&#064;&#097;&#112;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#109;&#110;&#110;&#102;&#101;&#101;&#100;&#098;&#097;&#099;&#107;&#064;&#097;&#112;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>.</p>

            <p>After the meeting at Olson Kundig, we went to <a href="http://www.steelheaddiner.com/">Steelhead Diner</a> for dinner. They participate in the <a href="http://www.dinearoundseattle.org/">Dine Around Seattle</a> promotion that a lot of Seattle restaurants do in November. This year, it’s 3-for-30, or 3 courses for $30. From <a href="http://www.dinearoundseattle.org/restaurants_show.php?rdx=31">their menu</a>, I had the clam chowder and Gay had the fried oysters for appetizers and I had the salmon and Gay had the ribeye steak for the entree. They were out of the chocolate pecan pie dessert that I wanted so I got the spiced pumpkin creme brulee and Gay got the chocolate mousse. Everything was delicious.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We met with Tom and Dan this afternoon their third round of drawings. Today the firm, Olson Sundberg Kundig Allen, <a href="http://www.djc.com/news/ae/12012172.html">announced its name change</a> to the shorter Olson Kundig. A big change for a firm that has been around as long as they have. But it’s easier to say!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4114715147/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2579/4114715147_29f4d6ddbd.jpg" alt="Topography" /></a></p>

<p>The latest drawings included one was what we essentially designed at <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/11/05/architect-meeting-2/">the last meeting</a> and there were two modified versions of it. One of the alternatives had a different placement for the kitchen that we liked. We changed to that and spent some time taking the stuff we liked from last week’s design. The next drawing may be pretty close to the actual schematic design.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>We should have one more drawing and, assuming we don’t have any new ideas or changes, we will start working in the 3rd dimension. Even seeing it in two dimensions, I can tell it’s going to be a very cool house. But we’re wary of the cost. We want the house to have a rustic/unfinished look but, ironically, it costs more to look unfinished than it does to just nail up cheap 2x4s and slap drywall on them. And big glass walls are expensive. We’ll be involving contractors at some point to get an idea of the cost and to see how many compromises we’ll have to make to keep it under budget.</p>

<p>After Thanksgiving, Tom’s taking a month-long motorcycle trip from Seattle to Patagonia so we probably won’t get much done between now and the end of the year.</p>

<p>Using the survey data, they made a model of our property laser-cut out of cork, as can be seen in the photo above. Each “step” is 2 feet, so our property has more of an incline than you’d expect from looking at it in real life. The blocks represent different parts of the house and the sticks represent trees. One of our concerns with placing the garage farther north on the property was that it will be a steep climb (20 feet!) from the garage to the house. But we think we can build the garage a few feet higher and make the grade more smooth to lessen the climb.</p>

            <a class="post-link" href="/2009/11/10/washington-state-referendum-71.html">Washington State Referendum 71</a>
          </h3>
            <p>Earlier this year, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2009233610_webdomestic18.html">Washington State passed  legislation</a> to bestow equal rights on same-sex couples that married couples have. As it has been in 31 other states, a Christian group called “Protect Marriage” launched an attack on it in Washington by putting it to a popular vote under the guise of “democracy”. Referendum 71 was born. A popular vote sounds like American democracy but anyone who went through high school understands (or should understand) that The Constitution of the US was written to, among other things, protect the minority from the tyranny of the majority.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>It’s important to note that this law in Washington is not about marriage, it just grants the same legal rights to same-sex couples that married couples are given. So it really has nothing to do with the hot-button word “marriage” – the Christians simply didn’t want people to have equal rights like hospital visitation rights, have access to shared health insurance, rules of inheritance, etc. Besides,  <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_dira.htm">the more religious a person is, the more likely they are to be divorced</a> so if the Christians want to protect marriage, they should stop throwing stones from inside their glass houses.</p>

<p>Washington State residents, however, defeated the bigots and approved Referendum 71, upholding the law. I’m proud to live in the state that is the first to uphold basic civil rights for same-sex couples!</p>

<p>Inter-racial marriage was legalized nationally in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia">a Supreme Court decision in 1967</a> but only <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/28417/most-americans-approve-interracial-marriages.aspx">accepted by the majority of the US population as late as 1983</a> and is still only at 77% today. <a href="http://contexts.org/socimages/2009/11/05/support-for-same-sex-marriage-by-age-and-state/">This graph</a> clearly shows that same-sex marriage opposition decreases as older generations die-off, so just as with the end to slavery, civil rights, women being allowed to vote, equal rights for same-sex couples will come to America. The only question is whether people born in the next few generations are embarrassed by their ancestors’ bigotry or not.</p>

<p><strong>Note to gay-bashers who happen upon this blog via Google:</strong> I am not gay. This site is called “TroyandGay” because it is the personal site for two people; one named “Troy” and the other named “Gay”, both heterosexuals. We simply support equal rights because we are Americans, we believe in equality for everyone, even people who are not exactly like us and we believe the Constitution should be upheld. So please spout your anti-gay rhetoric to someone who doesn’t yet know you’re a moron.</p>
