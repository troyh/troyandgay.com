          </h3>
            <p>We met with the architects this afternoon for the next round after <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/10/16/new-architect/">round 1</a>.</p>

<p>It could have gone either way after the last meeting – this round could turn out to be a good step forward or it could be just like the meetings with our previous architects where there was little new and the meetings were mostly a waste of time. Fortunately, it went great. We had a productive 2 hours and basically have the layout of the house decided, just like that! I can’t believe that after less than four weeks and just one iteration we’re way past where Miller-Hull was after 10 weeks and five meetings.</p>

<p>Today, Tom and Dan had three more evolutions of the initial four designs and one was pretty close to what we wanted. We explained what we liked and didn’t like about each of the designs and over the course of the meeting we hashed out some changes to that design. Tom’s very talented, he can listen to us and immediately start drawing and has good ideas on the spot. There’s still some minor details and the exact sizes of rooms to work out, but I think we’re pretty close on a floor plan.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to see the elevations, to start thinking in three dimensions and getting an idea of what the house will actually look like.</p>

            <p>My dad’s still <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/10/31/my-dad-in-the-hospital/">in the hospital</a> and they just got the results of the bone scan this morning and the cancer has not spread to his bones, which is very good news! He’s leaving the hospital today and will have his kidney removed in the near future. I think we have to wait until then to find out if the tumor is cancerous and if it has spread to other organs.</p>

            <p>Today’s my 40th birthday. The government gave me a free hour and the NFL gave the Steelers the day off so they could celebrate my birthday too.</p>

<p>I had The Reverend Belgian Quadrupel Ale (to celebrate my 4 decades) from <a href="http://www.averybrewing.com/">Avery</a> while watching football and barbecuing the steaks. With dinner, we opened a bottle of <a href="http://www.kvintners.com/">K Vintners</a> El Jefe that we bought two years ago on a visit to Walla Walla.</p>

            <p>My dad had hernia surgery this week. At midnight on Friday/Saturday my dad felt bad and told my mom he wanted to go to the emergency room. He had a burning sensation in his chest and thought he was having a heart attack so they did an EKG and a CAT scan. His heart is fine but they happened to discover a tumor on his kidney. He’d be spending the weekend in the hospital and we’d all have to wait until Monday for a “bone scan” to determine if the cancer had spread to his bones.</p>
