              <p>I first found out that a bourbon named after Hudson exists <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/04/29/date-night/">in April last year</a> and read <a href="http://ajiggerofblog.com/2009/03/02/review-hudson-baby-bourbon-whiskey/">good things</a> about it. I’ve been waiting patiently for it to make its way to Seattle. But it still hasn’t. We saw it in San Francisco <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/01/15/san-francisco-2/">last week</a> at a <a href="http://www.bevmo.com/">BevMo!</a> but couldn’t take it on the plane so we could only look at it through glass. Thankfully, my wife is smart and she called the Vashon liquor store and asked if they could special-order it. They could and did and and she surprised me with it today.</p>

<p>We got bottle 331 of batch 5 from 2008. It is much smoother but lacks the sweetness and cinnamon spiciness of Maker’s Mark, which isn’t surprising since it’s not aged very long (hence the name “baby”) and it’s made with 100% corn (and 100% from New York). According to <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-9976598-52.html">this</a>, Maker’s Mark is made with 70% corn, 16% red winter wheat (whatever that is) and 14% malted barley (just like beer!).</p>

              <p>We took a mid-week weekend trip to San Francisco, thanks to cheap Virgin airfare and Kelly willing to take care of the kids for two nights. Since we were without kids, we rented a Mini Cooper and toured Marin County, an area of San Francisco we’ve never explored.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4284863523/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4020/4284863523_7645472712.jpg" alt="Mini Cooper S" /></a></p>

<p>This is our first time being without the kids, except the nights we were in the hospital when Hudson was born and Kelly stayed with Havana. It’s amazing how easy it is to go places when you don’t have to pack and unpack kids. It’s also amazing how much you can miss them and their jabbering.</p>

<p>Two blocks from  the hotel, heading to the car rental to return the car, I missed a stop sign in a confusing intersection and, of course, the cops know it so there was a motorcycle cop sitting there waiting to give out tickets. There’s a traffic light that was green but it was for buses only and I followed the bus right through it. Doh! I got the first traffic ticket I’ve had in over 22 years!</p>

<p>We came back to the intersection a half-an-hour later so I could see how I made the mistake and the cop was still there. I respect police officers and what they do, but sitting in an intersection that you know is confusing waiting to give out tickets to motorists is not a public service. If the intersection is confusing, convince the city to change it to make it safer for motorists and pedestrians. Keeping it confusing and unsafe just so you can kill time and meet your ticket quota is not an honorable thing for a police officer to do.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>We met with Tom and Dan at their office for the first time <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/11/24/architects-meeting-4/">in a while</a>. There were some minor changes to the kitchen, garage and master bedroom and they scaled the main part of the house down to save on square footage. We saw the first elevations (side view, not just a floor plan) but, frankly, we weren’t wow-ed by it and we want to be. Granted, it’s hard to imagine what it would look like in 3D looking at a 2D drawing. It would be a good-looking house and probably look weird  to someone used to more traditional designs, but we want something that amazes us and we aren’t there yet.
<!-- more -->After the meeting we went to <a href="http://www.kokorasgreekgrill.com/">Kokoras</a>, a place I’ve wondered about because it’s Greek and I can’t find any good Greek food in Seattle. From the outside, it doesn’t look appealing so we’ve always decided against us. We decided to finally try it. We went inside and ordered take-out and then went across the street to Beveridge Place Pub, where they don’t serve food so encourage you to get take-out and bring it there.</p>

<p>We surprisingly ran into Heather and Larry, Kelly’s parents, there. We had a beer with them while watching the Alabama-Texas game while we waited for our food order. Later, I went to get the food and they went to meet another daughter of theirs to go to an art opening.</p>

<p>The food was good, even when served in take-out boxes. We noticed that it’s also very kid-friendly so we’ll have to go eat there sometime and try some other dishes with the kids.</p>
