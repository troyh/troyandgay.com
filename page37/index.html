            <p>Havana went to her friend Boyan’s house for a play date after school. His parents brought them over to our house for dinner and we all went to the annual “hoedown” at Havana’s school.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>A few months ago <a href="http://troyh.github.com/homebrew/batch.html?id=016">I brewed a clone</a> of Maritime’s Jolly Roger Christmas Ale, my favorite Christmas beer. This year’s version was just released and I got a 6-pack just as the keg of my cloned version of it ran out.</p>

<p>Here’s the two:

<!-- more -->
<p>The one on the left is the real thing and mine is on the right. This was literally the last of the keg, a half-pint was all that was left after CHUGfest, a local homebrew club’s 1st annual beer festival, where I served it. Because it’s the bottom of the keg, it’s cloudier than normal and clearly cloudier than the original. But the taste was very close! Mine has a more pronounced hop aroma and flavor, I think I just added a bit too much hops in the boil and dry-hopped. I think if I tone down the hops a bit, I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between the two.</p>

<p>For lunch today, Gay and I went to Maritime’s (new) Jolly Roger taproom for more of the real thing, but on tap instead of in the bottle. I found out yesterday afternoon that last night they were serving 2012’s Jolly Roger, 2010’s Jolly Roger, Jolly Roger aged in a rum barrel (appropriate for the pirate theme) and Jolly Roger aged with cherries in a brandy barrel. It was too short a notice for me to get there last night, but they still had them on tap today so we got a sampler and I had a full pint of 2012’s version.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/8189669892/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8481/8189669892_9b0ddf1808.jpg" alt="Untitled" /></a></p>

<p>The keg version is more hoppy than the bottled version but still not as hoppy as mine. The 2010 aged well and tastes more sweet, towards a barleywine. The rum barrel version was slightly more sweet but didn’t have the expected oak flavor and the cherry/brandy version was similar but had a little bit of a tart taste. All were very good. Lunch was good too.</p>

            <p>Gay and I went to <a href="http://madisonparkconservatory.com/">Madison Park Conservatory</a> for dinner to celebrate our 8th wedding anniversary. Nice summery night and good food. We had oysters and their pate with blueberry jelly for appetizers, I had the steak and Gay had the pork belly. For drinks, I had their Brooklyn 46, the first cocktail I’ve seen offered with Makers 46, and with dinner I had <a href="http://www.dogfish.com/brews-spirits/the-brews/occasional-rarities/faithfull-ale.htm">Dogfish Head’s Faithfull Ale</a>.</p>
