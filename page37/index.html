          <p>Americans spent $1.5 billion on lottery tickets just for this one. 25% of that, $375 million, pays for government services. 44 states participate, so on average, my state received $8.5 million. With a population of 6.8 million, I receive $1.25 in government services for free. Even better, <a href="http://m.cbsnews.com/storysynopsis.rbml?pageType=eveningNews&amp;catid=57407364&amp;feed_id=29">Americans spend $56 billion</a> on lottery tickets every year, or 37 times as much, so I receive an estimated $46.25 in government services every year without spending a penny. That’s $231.25 for my family each year. Thank you lottery players, keep it up!</p>

<blockquote>In other words, Americans may protest loudly, but their economic behavior indicates a remarkable indifference to the price of oil. In Europe, where taxes keep gas prices well above $5 a gallon, citizens are more likely to take public transportation and live near the center of town. The streets are filled with mopeds and tiny cars. The United States, on the other hand, barely exerts the minimum effort expected of a gas-phobic society: its enthusiasm for car pooling, enhanced public transportation and fuel-efficient vehicles remains relatively low. The average American even spends more gas money on social and recreational trips (about $13 a week, on average) than on their commutes to and from work (around $8). If gas prices truly damage the quality of our lives, we have done a remarkable job of hiding it.</blockquote>

          <p><a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2017801872_apusdrillnowfactcheck.html">Breaking news</a>, Republicans don’t understand economics or even simple math:</p>

<blockquote>The calculations "help make the point that U.S. production and demand have little to do with the price of gasoline in the U.S., and lend support to the notion that there is not a great deal we in the U.S., acting alone, can do to affect the price of gasoline," Peterson wrote in an email. He pointed out that Energy Department figures show that gas prices in the U.S. seem to rise and fall similarly to gas prices in Europe, showing that it has little to do with American drilling.
And that's the key. It's a world market, economists say.
Unlike natural gas or electricity, the United States alone does not have the power to change the supply-and-demand equation in the world oil market, said Christopher Knittel, a professor of energy economics at MIT. American oil production is about 11 percent of the world's output, so even if the U.S. were to increase its oil production by 50 percent - that is more than drilling in the Arctic, increased public-lands and offshore drilling, and the Canadian pipeline would provide - it would at most cut gas prices by 10 percent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>According to Richman, it was just now hitting him how many hours of his life he's pissed away listening intently to nonsense about celebrity couples, how good or bad certain pens are, and why a particular sports team might have a chance this year. The husband and father of two said that every time he's felt at all put out or bored by a bullshit conversation—especially a speculative one about how bad allergy season was going to be—he should have just turned around, walked away, and gone rafting or rappelling or done any of the millions of other things he's always wanted to do but never thought he had time for.</blockquote>
