              <p>I just saw <a href="http://news.com.com/1601-2-5095074.html">a video</a> of Steve Ballmer, CEO of Microsoft, arguing why closed-source is better than open-source. One of his reasons was that Microsoft takes responsibility for the problems with their products to their customers and said that any customer “knows where to find him” and they can email him at steveb@microsoft.com. So I took him up on his offer and emailed him:</p>

<p>`
To: steveb@microsoft.com
Subject: Windows XP problem</p>

<p>I just watched the video of you being interviewed at the Gartner Symposium and you mentioned that you take responsibility for problems in your products (as opposed to open-source products where you say that no one is responsible) and that your customers can email you at steveb@microsoft.com. So that’s what I’m doing…</p>

<p>My Windows XP crashed this morning (it said something about an error in “0x800000EA03BC0A” or something like that) and I lost some work I was doing in Office 2000. Assuming what you said was true, can you take responsibility for this problem that one of your customers is having and fix Windows XP and/or Office 2000 so that it doesn’t crash anymore?</p>

<p>Your customer,
Troy Hakala
`</p>

<p>Let’s see if he was telling the truth.</p>

              <p>I took pictures during my bike ride this morning. Today was a great morning, it was quiet, I wasn’t too hot or cold while riding, the fresh air smelled like wintergreen, I could smell fires in chimneys burning and the sun was peaking out behind the clouds.

These were taken with the camera on my <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,2273,00.html">Nokia 3650</a> cell phone, so they’re not the greatest quality, but they’re good enough.</p>

              <p>Walt Mossberg <a href="http://ptech.wsj.com/archive/solution-20031022.html">reviews the new music services</a>. He correctly concludes that iTunes is the best (but neglects to point out MusicMatch’s and Napster’s biggest flaw: they don’t support Macs, the platform where 70% of the legal online music-buying is done today). One feature I’d like to see in iTunes is the ability to re-download songs I’ve purchased, a feature Napster has, apparently. And they all should allow me to listen to the entire album several times before I purchase it.</p>

<p>But as impatient as I’ve been in a good download service and as amazed at how well the iTunes store works, I find that I won’t download music from iTunes either. I’d rather pay the extra $5 for a CD and get a higher-quality version, in spite of the fact that the majority of my music-listening is done on my computer or my iPod. The best feature of an online service is that I get the music immediately, but they still can’t beat the free file-sharing services on that. I routinely get music that isn’t even available yet on these services or even available on CD. And file-sharing services give me the best feature of all: I can hear an entire song/album before making my buying decision. I buy much fewer CDs I don’t like these days but buy more total CDs, and that’s good for me and for the music industry.</p>

              <p>I’ve been sitting on the couch tonight getting up-to-date on news via the web and listening to my music through TiVo on the TV. I already get the majority of my media over the internet. And while listening to KEXP over the internet, I just heard that musician <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bio.asp?oid=4239&amp;cf=4239">Elliott Smith</a> <a href="http://www.sweetadeline.net/"> died today</a> at the age of 34 of <a href="http://www.undercover.com.au/news/2003/20031022_elliottsmith.html">an apparent suicide</a>.</p>
