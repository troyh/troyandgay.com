        <article>
          <p>We’ve been working on getting our Vashon house ready to put on the market, working on the landscaping plan budget and working with the metal fabricators designing the hardware for the barn doors for the attic. I called Mark to talk about the barn door hardware design and he listed all the work that was going on at the house. Lots of stuff had been done since we were there on Friday: </p>

<p>Kitchen cabinetry installation was finished and the drawers and doors were going on, the countertops for the kids’ bathrooms was installed with their sinks, the tile on Hudson’s bathroom is almost done, Twisted Metalworks was there measuring for the office wall, the Ipê wood was delivered, the painters put all the colors on all the walls and ceiling and Nancy and My were there yesterday reviewing them and the finish carpentry was continuing. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5617042461/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5028/5617042461_8d2b9de961.jpg" alt="Ipê flooring is here!" /></a></p>

<p>It’s amazing how much progress can happen in just a few days. Plus, Mark had our electrician come out today to look at installing the security cameras that the security company will provide.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>We had lots of meetings scheduled today: the landscape designer, Scot, came over to go over his budget estimate, Ryan from Superior Stucco came over to talk about the exterior stucco and two visits by security companies.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5603008485/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5064/5603008485_0ae87435ce.jpg" alt="IMG_6631" /></a></p>

<p>Since we’d be in Seattle all day, we decided to give Kelly the day off and take the kids with us and go out to dinner. They had fun playing in the house with all the people working and running around the front yard. Eventually, they got bored so it was time for the big gun: watching a movie on the iPad.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p><a href="http://www.froulaalarms.com/cms/">Froula Security</a> was first and I walked him around the house so he could bid on a security system. Because the house has exceeded a threshold in value, the insurance company requires us to put security cameras around the house during construction. I don’t get it, cameras aren’t going to stop crimes; at best, they help police find the stupid criminal who didn’t know to cover their face. Froula seems like a professional operation, unlike ADT.</p>

<p>Scot arrived and we went through the project estimate line by line so we can get an idea of how much each part costs and work on a budget.</p>

<p>We ordered pizzas for lunch from <a href="http://madpizza.com">Mad Pizza</a> for the crew and then talked with Ryan about the stucco. Schuchart/Dow went out for other bids on painting/coloring the exterior and there were dissenting opinions on what is best to do – each said they can do the right thing, of course. In the end, we decided to continue our plan to fog coat the stucco to color it but we’re not sure whether to use a bonding agent, which will decrease breathability, or not under the fog coat. Ryan will do a test without the bonding agent next week.</p>

<p>We talked with Mark and Katie about various other things and carried the paint samples they made this week around to each room. Nancy and My had been there yesterday looking at the colors and they gave us a list of rooms and their chosen colors. They are having the colors they liked painted on the walls and ceilings before a final decision is made. It’s hard for us to pick one color over another when it gets down to exact shades, so we’re relying on their eyes to pick them. This is something they’re very good at and even when we initially disagree, we later realize they’re right.</p>

<p>The ADT salesguy came over (with a very odd hat) in the afternoon to scope out camera locations and to give us an estimate. I don’t understand ADT… their salespeople are contracted out, they’re not ADT employees and don’t drive ADT cars and vans. And I got mail from the ADT guy from an aol.com address, not an adt.com address. It seems unprofessional for one of the big names in home security.</p>

<p>The Schuchart/Dow woodworkers, including a new guy Jake, were busy putting trim around the 2nd floor walls, doors and windows and are almost finished. They were also preparing the family room floor for the Ipe wood flooring that will start late next week or early the following week after it’s arrived and has been cured. Except for the master bathroom and closets, the theater and a couple pieces for the kitchen island, the cabinetry boxes is all installed. Mark from Twisted Metalworks was there again finishing up the attic brackets.</p>

<p>Once we were done at the house, we had planned to take the kids out for dinner. It was such a nice day it would have been nice to stay in the city. Hudson didn’t get a nap, though, so he was tired and wouldn’t last through a dinner at a restaurant. We decided to just go home so he could get to bed early. We made the 4:40p ferry, had a quick dinner and Hudson was asleep by 6.</p>

          <p>My iPad 2 finally arrived. I ordered it on the Monday after the Friday it was released, when<a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/03/11/ipad-2-day/"> I didn’t get one at the local store</a>. Almost 4 weeks later, it arrived. My SmartCover arrived a couple weeks ago.</p>

<p>It’s quite a bit faster than the older iPad and I really like how the SmartCover props it up for typing. But why doesn’t iTunes sync the app organization?!? It took me an hour to rearrange all my installed apps.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>I had to go to the house today to move the speakers I installed in the foyer. They had to be installed early because they’re installed into the drywall and the drywallers needed to tape and mud it over. But the interior designers picked some <a href="http://www.restorationhardware.com/catalog/product/product.jsp?productId=prod80525&amp;searchId=1301502757719">antelope</a> <a href="http://www.restorationhardware.com/catalog/product/product.jsp?productId=prod80521&amp;categoryId=">heads</a> we want to hang in the same place the speakers were installed, so the speakers need to be moved over to make it possible to mount the heads.</p>

<p>Gay, Eva and I took the 9:40a ferry and got to the house by 10:30a after a quick stop at Top Pot Doughnuts. Mark from Twisted Metalworks was there finishing the bracket installation in the attic, the tile guys finished the kitchen floor and were getting ready to do the bathroom walls, Kurt was busy with window and door trim, Colin was finishing up the blocking in the basement ceiling (which looks original!), and the cabinetry was being installed in the kitchen and butler’s pantry.</p>

<p>Colin and I worked on the foyer speakers, he did the south one and I did the north one, but we had to go before we finished, so I left it to Colin to finish.</p>

        <article>
          <p>We went to Seattle today for some errands and for me to go install the gas springs on the garage trapdoor. Mark from Twisted Metalworks happened to be there installing the brackets in the attic for the moving wall that they’re going to build.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5579318427/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5180/5579318427_23e40536fc.jpg" alt="Attic wall bracket" /></a></p>

<p>They had made the brackets that were installed in the ceiling months ago. Now he had the rods that screw into those brackets and hold the lower brackets fastened to the cross-ties. These brackets will hold the track for the wall. Olson Kundig designed them and, on paper, weren’t that interesting to us, but now that we saw them we really like them. The brass washer is a nice touch, although we’re not sure it was intentional.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>I helped out a little handing the rods up to Mark (from Twisted Metalworks, not Mark from SD) while he was standing above the cross-ties so he could screw them into the hidden brackets in the ceiling. While Gay left and ran her errands, I went to the garage to install the gas springs on the trapdoor. I had tried a couple weeks ago to install them but found out that the ones I bought were too short and weren’t strong enough to lift the door, which turned out to be heavier than I thought it was. I had ordered longer and stronger versions, including better brackets as the others were bending under the weight, and had them installed pretty quickly. It works pretty well too… after you lift the door about 16 inches the springs take over and lift the door the rest of the way all by themselves. No more feeling like you’re about to be pulled into the hole in the floor! It’s also much easier to close it, you can just push it from the other side a couple feet and it closes by itself, so you don’t have to reach across the opening or stand on the side and lower it.</p>

<p>A bunch of the cabinetry had been delivered this week and was being installed. All the cabinetry in the bathrooms, except for the master bathroom, had been installed and the installer was finishing up Eva’s cabinetry today.</p>

<p>All the wood for the trim around the house arrived while I was waiting for Gay to get back and the guys hauled that in. The kitchen tile had been started yesterday and was getting closer to completion today. That looks great. Things are moving fast now but we’re told everything will feel like it came to a screeching halt when painting starts, hopefully in a few weeks.</p>
