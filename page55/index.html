          </h3>
            <p>Just like <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2010/11/06/octane-fitness-err-3/">last time</a>, the Octane Fitness elliptical started giving me the infamous “Err 3” after workouts. Just like last time, it got progressively worse and happened more and more frequently, but I could reset it enough to use it. Then the tension feature suddenly started to always be at the highest tension, which is so high I couldn’t run for more than few minutes. I called Octane Fitness and, again, quickly got a hold of a competent tech support guy. He knew exactly what the tension problem was – broken cables inside the brake. He said he’d send me replacements for free. I then said the Err 3 is back and he immediately said he’d send me another new stride motor, my 4th!, free of charge.</p>

<p>I got the parts yesterday, installed them fairly quickly, and was up and (fake) running again. Gotta love Octane Fitness’ customer support! I’ve now repaired almost every part on this elliptical at least once. I can’t switch to another brand now because I know this thing so well and can easily repair it myself.</p>

<p>The brake cables wearing out is expected, they’re just the stranded steel cables that bicycle brakes have so they don’t last forever when they’re constantly being used. But I don’t understand why I go through so many stride motors. I seem to be needing a new one every 8-10 months these days. It doesn’t make sense given that I never even change the stride (although it adjusts it automatically at times) and the motors are simple things. 10 miles/day doesn’t seem excessive for an elliptical. I think it’s a bug in the software that erroneously reports “Err 3”.</p>

            <p>Havana and Hudson have French camp this week so we could leave Eva with Kelly and we went to the house to keep working on the stuff I need to do. Gay helped me get all the CAT6 wires punched into the patch panel, a tedious job, and then to test all the wires through the house. They all tested fine. Then I hooked up all the speakers, except for the foyer speakers, to a receiver and we tested those and they all work too. Not bad for my first (and last) low-voltage sub-contractor job. Gay worked out all the issues with the electrical parts and finalized the cabinetry hardware positions with Mark. 
<!-- more --></p>

<p>The progress on the house continued with the many final details. Tim finished up the kitchen window trim and the guest room sliding door hardware. The stone guy was cutting the holes in the counters for the plumbing fixtures and finished installing and sealing the powder room stone. 12th Ave Iron was templating for the kitchen sliding door cladding. Twisted Metalworks is halfway done installing the kitchen pantry shelving steel facia. The tile guys were finishing up the kitchen tile and grouting the master bath tile, now that the grout color was selected. Bill, the electrician, was finishing up the garage electrical. The basement step treads were installed and Kurt finished the final piece at the top of the stairs. The bathroom fixtures (towel rods, toilet paper holders) were getting installed. All 7 (!) thermostats are installed. The painters were doing touch-up painting. And the stucco guys started coloring the exterior!</p>

<p>I still have some work to do for the speakers, install that last piece of ladder rack in the basement, need to pick TVs and amplifiers and get them installed, and schedule Comcast and DirecTV for installations.</p>

            <p>Today, Gay and I left the kids at home with Kelly and took the 8:40a ferry, optimistic to have a more productive day at the house than <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/06/23/tiring-thursday/">yesterday</a>. Traffic was better today, so it was already looking up. After a quick stop at Home Depot, we got to the house and quickly got to work. We got all the wire pulled into the room again and we identified all the cables again because the labels were removed when I had to cut them and pull them back. Gay ran to the Lexus dealer in Bellevue to return loaner car and pick up our car from the service department while I finished installing the speakers in the ceilings, now that the kitchen and family room ceilings had been painted. This was a much more productive day!</p>

<p>Lots of progress on the house this week: master bath tile was finished and most of the butler’s pantry and kitchen tile was finished, the sliding door hardware in the attic was finished and installed, the painters finished the dining room, kitchen and family room and the few radiators we needed painted, the HVAC guys were installing the thermostats and had to fix some tough electrical issues with the boiler that I didn’t bother to ask the details about, the electrician put most of the electrical outlets in the garage and Colin reframed the garage doors preparing for the new garage doors next week, Tim and Kurt did miscellaneous woodwork (closet shelving, the base trim on the main floor, sauna exterior wall, the risers for the basement stairs). The stone guys did two-thirds of the powder room wall.</p>

<p>The floor guys are going to work on Saturday to put the final coat on the floors so all the protection was taken off the floors, so we got to see all the floors for the first time since they were refinished.</p>

<p>Next week, the garage doors should get installed, the electrical should be done in the garage, the rest of the appliances should be installed, some more decorative steel should be installed, possibly the steel basement stair guard rails will get built and maybe even installed (probably not), all the tile and stone work should be done and the exterior should get colored. And I may get the speakers all hooked up and playing music!</p>

<p>Only two weeks before we’re scheduled to move-in, so it’s crunch time and they have lots of little things to get finished. I also need to decide on and order all the A/V equipment so I can install it the last week.</p>

<p>We also got a surprise gift from Schuchart/Dow…. Katie stopped by while we were there and gave us our very own Schuchart/Dow jackets! When the project first began, there were a bunch of SD employees meeting with us all wearing these jackets. They look pretty sharp and commented on how nice they are. They explained that the employees get one of these jackets on their 5th anniversary. The men’s are nice Carhartt black jackets with the Shuchart/Dow logo (I love their logo) stitched on the lower back and their names stitched on the pocket. I got one of those. Gay got a ladies Patagonia black jacket with the logo on the back and her name stitched on the left arm. We were pretty excited about those. Gay hasn’t gotten any SD gear, but I’ve made out like a bandit: they’ve given me two work shirts, a more casual Dickies work jacket and even a hardhat. I love wearing the SD shirt when I work at the house because the few sub-contractors who don’t know who I am think I’m just another SD employee, not the homeowner, so I get treated like everyone else rather than have my butt kissed as the homeowner.</p>

            <p>Havana and Eva had doctor’s appointments so we went to the house so I could do some work while they went to the doctor in the afternoon. The day started bad with traffic on the West Seattle Bridge, I-99 and I-5 so we drove south to avoid it, Eva started crying and we took the long route to the house. Once we got to the house, the work I had to do did not go well. Because we moved the ladder rack from the position we were originally going to install it, all the wires were on the wrong side of a radiator pipe bracket. We couldn’t temporarily move the bracket, so I had to pull all the wires out, re-route them around the bracket and then put them back. Simple idea, but it turned into a mess. The wires all became tangled because there wasn’t enough room to spread them out. Me, Mark and later, a Schuchart/Dow intern spent a couple hours straightening them all out. That’s about all I got done all day, so it was frustrating.</p>

<p>While I kept working, Gay took the kids out to a park and then picked up dinner for us. We sat on the floor upstairs eating our dinner, while I complained about the work I still had to do. We didn’t get home until 10:30p and were going back in the next day, hoping for a better day.</p>
