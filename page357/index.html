          <p>It’s 10pm and I’m just getting ready to eat dinner. And watch OLN’s “definining moments” show on the Tour de France with the first interview with Armstrong.</p>

The U.S. is just 227 years old (11 generations of people) and we’ve already forgotten one of the biggest problems  the creation of the U.S. solved. Stunning. Americans really do have a short attention span and absolutely no sense of history.</p>

          <p>We recently had a <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll">troll</a> on <a href="http://recipezaar.com">the site</a>. In classic troll behavior, he posted good threads, but quickly started controversial topics and fanned the flames by posting often and making vague personal attacks. When we privately tried to talk to him about what he’s doing, he basically told us “Too bad, I can say whatever I want and you can’t stop me and if you try, you’re censors! I’ve been doing this for years and am better at this than you are!”. People are weird. So we gave him the customary Warning #1. He then told us what we can do with our “threats” and our web site and that he won’t be back. He lied. Twice he came back. Troll.</p>

<p>When he advocates gay marriage and refutes race-mixing we let it go until the topic devolves into name-calling. Then, of course, we are branded censors, or pro-Gay by the anti-Gay people and anti-Gay by the pro-Gay people, white supremacists and politically-correct. It’s nuts. But nobody sees how nuts this is. And people forget that it’s a recipe web site. We’re here to help people enjoy good food, not debate interracial relationships. But trolls understand that people are quick to get emotional about topics and perspective goes out the window and trolls enjoy watching it. And the emotions run so high we become the target of the attacks if we try to calm people down. It’s the textual equivalent of an angry mob – rational thought has no place. It’s a scary thing to watch, even in text.</p>

          <p>Whoa, is the mainstream media actually starting to understand the meaning of “free software”? <a href="http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20030731.gttwtico31/BNStory/einsider/?query=Linux">The Globe And Mail</a>:</p>

<p>Myth: Linux succeeds only because it’s free.</p>

<p>Reality: Linux is free, therefore hard to compete with. But it’s not that it’s just like free beer. It’s also free like the English language, in that anyone can see how it works and add new parts that make it better. And it’s free in that it runs on computers from many manufacturers, meaning more competition. Linux is also better. It’s reliable. It doesn’t crash much. It resists hacker attacks. With Linux you can have your cake (openness and competition) and eat it too (dependability)._</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Our good friend Nicki is leaving Sunday for a 3 month trial job in New York City.  We had a lovely dinner to say goodbye last night (with friends Eric &amp; Steve as well).  This is such a great opportunity: “try out New York, no strings attached, we pay your rent…”  I’m quite jealous, and at the same time, saying goodbye always makes you realize you should spend more time with your friends before the bon voyage parties.  As an aside, we heard a HORROR story about a dinner they had at <a href="http://www.theherbfarm.com/Index2.tmpl">The Herbfarm</a>, one of Seattle’s most expensive restaurants.  For a prix fixe menu well over $100/person you would not expect servers to rudely grab unfinished plates, balk at requests for coffee, loudly announce the mistake of providing an expired credit card, to only begrudgingly provide wine information, to not accommodate outdoor smokers. …actually the list goes on…did I mention that they lectured the customers for 45 minutes before dinner on every detail of the place and the meal in such a way as to make everyone aware of just how lucky they are to be at their pretentious establishment, and yet all the gaudy restaurant decorations are not so subtlety advertised for sale – how tacky.</p>
