              <p>I think we just had an earthquake here in Bali.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: It’s <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/SP276054.htm">confirmed</a>, a 5.0 quake hit right near us off the coast. We talked with a couple locals about it and they did feel it too but thought nothing of it since minor quakes hit Bali often. And living in Seattle, quakes are fairly uneventful unless they hit 6.0 (10x more powerful than a 5.0) or more.</p>

              <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2065.jpg" alt="IMG_2065.jpg" />We spent most of the day at our hotel sunbathing and reading. It’s so humid here that you can only sit outside, even in the shade, for 30 minutes before you have to get in the pool to cool off. So that’s what we did all morning and afternoon: alternate between the chaise lounge and the pool. This was the most relaxing day we’ve had for over a week. And Gay’s even learning to swim!</p>

<p>In the afternoon, we decided to go for a walk on the beach. But I made the mistake of wearing a long-sleeve and heavy linen shirt. It was fine on the breezy beach, but when we walked into the town of Legian, the lack of a breeze and shade was too much and the hour-long walk through town ended in me being drenched in sweat. So we returned to the hotel to get back in the pool.</p>

<p>For dinner, we went to the hotel’s restaurant and to see the Indonesian dancing on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The buffet-style dinner was nice (barbecued beef, lamb and chorizo; salads; soup; lots of desserts). And the hotel has spotlights on the surf so you could see the white of the waves breaking even after sunset, which is a nice effect that I’ve never seen a beach hotel do.</p>

<p>By this time, it was <em>way</em> past our bedtime (9:30!), so we came back tired and went to bed.</p>

This place is a hotel without the rooms. It’s an extremely trendy place with extremely trendy customers. It sits right on the beach and has sunbathers and people lounging around on the seats. In fact, it’s not possible to not lounge on the seats, they’re just benches with thick cushions on them. I imagine the concept for the place is to attract people who are staying at low-end hotels or hotels not on the beach so they created a place where you can hang out all day and be served drinks. The exciting thing is that they have <a href="http://makersmark.com">Maker’s Mark</a>; this is the first time we’ve seen it here so we had to have a manhattan. We had a couple drinks and watched the surfers and the sunset before moving to the dining area for dinner. If you look closely, you can see surfers out in the water.</p>

<p>Dinner was excellent. I had braised lamb neck and Gay had the saffron seafood risotto. For the first time in Bali, I felt like I was not in Bali – the only Indonesians were the staff.</p>

<p>After dinner, we came back to the hotel and swam in the (heated?) pool and then to bed. We’ve been getting up at about 6:30am every day so by 9pm, we’re ready for bed, and in an air-conditioned room. I’m going to try to get on a similar schedule at home, although 9pm is still too early for me to go to bed.</p>

              <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_1996.jpg" alt="IMG_1996.jpg" />We rode to Seminyak this morning from Ubud. The drive took about 45 minutes, although if there was no traffic on the roads, it’d have taken maybe 15. Driving in Bali is pretty tough due to the masses of motorcycles and mopeds on the roads. Cars are constantly passing them, so it’s almost like there’s 3 lanes in the road which makes head-on collisions seem inevitable.</p>

<p>Along the way we ran into a procession to a cremation ceremony, so we pulled over and snapped a few photos. From what we understand, everyone is cremated in Indonesia and then the ashes are buried in cemeteries. When someone dies, they spend three days preparing the grounds for the ceremony and then the entire town gets dressed up and marches to the cremation grounds where the cremation is done. In contrast to western funerals, Indonesian funerals are lively events.</p>

<p>Speaking of non-western Indonesian customs, we’ve learned that Indonesians don’t make a big deal out of meals. In fact, families don’t eat meals together – the mother typically prepares food and leaves it in the kitchen all day for family members to eat when they want to. One of the expats we met told us that if you’re invited to a Indonesian’s house for dinner, the food is served buffet-style and you take some and eat it by yourself, usually in the corner. Very strange. I thought all cultures made food a key part of social events. It just goes to show that there’s an exception to every rule.</p>

<p>We arrived at our hotel, <a href="http://www.oberoihotels.com/resortdetails.asp?hi_id=19&amp;hotelcode=TXL-OB-HBDPSOB&amp;hl_id=5">The Oberoi</a>. Now this is a hotel! Even better than the Four Seasons, I think. And we once again have the privacy we wanted that we didn’t really have in Ubud. This should be a relaxing way to end our honeymoon. :)  The only drawback is the lack of WiFi internet in the room, we have to go to the “library” to get internet access. But we still have dialup through <a href="http://www.telkom.net.id/">TelkomNet</a>, which seems to provide free dialup to everyone – we’re using the same phone number, account name and password that they provide on their site. Free dialup internet in Indonesia. Go figure.</p>

<p>A nice thing about Seminyak is that we can walk into town and to the restaurants and shops. No scheduling a driver here. And it sounds like there’s lots of good restaurants here, including a <a href="http://www.indomykonos.com/">Greek restaurant</a> that we’ve heard good things about.</p>
