            <p>Our first breakfast in Bali, room service even. I had bagels and locks, Gay had eggs and sausage. The apple juice is the best apple juice I’ve ever had… can you “fresh-squeeze” an apple?! Gay had papaya juice, which was like a smoothie. The coffee here is very good too, of course.</p>

<p>Indonesian food is actually hard to come by in this area… all the restaurants in Jimbaran Bay serve seafood since it’s a fishing village and there’s some Indonesian sauces (sweet soy, peanut sauce, chile sauce, etc.) but, in general, they seem to cater to international visitors. For example, last night was the first time we found satay. I’m hoping that there’s more local food in Ubud and Semanyak.</p>

<p>Every day the hotel drops by a different fruit. Yesterday, it was “rambutan”:http://www.thefruitpages.com/avocadoes.shtml, something I’ve never seen before, but Gay recognized it from Thailand. You peel off the skin and inside is a squishy center… it’s like eating a big jelly bean without the sugar-coating.</p>

            <p>A couple shots of our “villa” at the hotel. The pool looking down the hill towards the beach. The straw roofs are the other villas.

          </h3>
            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/IMG_1609.jpg" alt="" />The flight from Taipei to Denpasar was much shorter, only 5 hours. And we were the only two people in Business class, so we had the first 5 rows of the plane and three flight attendants to ourselves. The service was impeccable. :) The food was very good, the appetizer is in the photo. And we had several glasses of wine and watched “Dodgeball” again (the only movie they showed this flight), but this time it was edited for Indonesia’s more strict decency rules; although it was funny to see what they missed censoring not understanding the American slang.</p>

<p>Arriving over Bali, we were stuck in a holding pattern for 15 minutes because the airport was closed due to a “VIP movement”. Presumably, someone important (Indonesian Royal Family, the President, etc.) was leaving or arriving at the same time. We bought prepaid SIM cards ($5/ea) for our cell phones so we can use the local cellular service instead of paying $5/minute in roaming charges. Turns out, my phone won’t accept a non T-Mobile SIM card, but Gay’s does. Note: don’t buy a cell phone from the service provider because they are “locked” to that service provider.</p>

<p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/IMG_1613.jpg" alt="" />Wow it’s hot here! Got to the hotel, checked in, went to the room and immediately got in the pool and had a beer. By that time, having not slept on the plane hardly at all, I was dead tired. So I fell asleep for two hours. Then we showered and went out to dinner (see picture).</p>

<p>The drive from the airport to the hotel:

            <p>The “hotel”:http://fourseasons.com/jimbaranbay/index.html has Wi-Fi, but it was intermittent today and eventually went out completely. Finally got back on tonight, so now I can post some photos.</p>

            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/IMG_1600.jpg" alt="" />Just got off a 13-hour flight and sitting in the lounge at the airport in Taipei with free Wi-Fi. :)  It’s very weird to be halfway around the world from home and be able to act like you’re at your desk, checking email, reading news, IMing, posting a blog entry…</p>

<p>The plane did not even crash <em>once</em> the entire flight. Just one more flight to go til Denpasar on Bali. We met a guy from Virginia here at the airport. He was on the same flight and flew from Richmond to Chicago to Seattle to Taipei.</p>

<p>I had a hard time sleeping on the plane, but got maybe 2-3 hours of sleep off and on. Watched “Dodgeball” (very funny) and “Harry Potter 3”.</p>
