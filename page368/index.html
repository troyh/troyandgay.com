        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>I’m not a very patriotic person. I tend to think it’s random that I happen to be born within the borders of a specific country. I like to think I’m a citizen of Earth, the Milky Way, whatever, than a citizen of the United States. But I was born here and I’ve lived here all my life. So I am a citizen. I’m a typical American, be that good or bad. I’ve spent some time outside the US and I was <em>extremely</em> anti-US policies in my youth and I still have some huge disagreements with our government (and probably always will). But seeing the fireworks and general happiness in people in the US on July 4th makes me feel good and I’m not sure why.</p>

<p>After 9/11, the patriotic-ness in the US surprised me (and probably surprised those siding with the terrorists as well). July 4th of any year will never live up to that feeling, I suppose, but both July 4ths since I’ve felt like they were little versions of the post-9/11 patriotic-ness. Granted, the meaning of July 4th is probably lost on most Americans and it’s more of a chance to drink beer (yay!) and eat hamburgers and hotdogs and enjoy pyrotechnics, but there’s something fascinating to me that everybody does it in unison. And they want to do it.</p>

<p>We went to a party at a friend’s house tonight for the holiday. We stopped on the way at a couple stores and everyone (strangers) were abnormally friendly. It’s surprising that in a country as big as the US, there’s still a feeling of togetherness and nationality.</p>

<p>I’ve probably had two too many beers. <img src="/img/smile.gif" alt="" /></p>

          <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/isight.jpg" alt="isight.jpg" />My boyfriend (left) is addicted to all thing gizmodo and to all things <a href="http://www.apple.com">apple</a>.  The <a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight</a> combines these two addictions.  He has spent the past 4 days at one end of the line repeating “can you hear me?” “can you see me?”  It has been like watching Bell himself.  The darn thing is adorable, but there are flaws and the software is still quite buggy…but it is so much fun to use.  We just wish more people had webcams now…</p>

        <article>
          <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/0936070250.jpg" alt="0936070250.jpg" /> I’ve been running a lot lately. A “lot” for me is like 5 miles 4 times/week.  I’m trying to throw in a weekly long run of 7 1/2 miles too until that is my regular run – can you tell there is a 2 1/2 mile loop near my house.  My pace has gone from 10 minute miles to 9 1/2 minute miles over the past 3 1/2 months that I’ve been running regularly.  So far only 3% body fat loss, but no actual weight loss…slow and steady…I have a couple of (marathon running) gal-neighbors to run with, and they are teaching me <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0936070250/recipezaar-20">Jeff Galloway’s plan</a> (see hokey 70s style book cover on right).  I’d like to run a half-marathon this year.  I figure, I trade my commute time for exercise, and I’m a completely different person that day.  You’d be amazed at how great it feels at 4p to think “I ran 5 miles today.”</p>
