          </h3>
            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/morrissey.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I just got <a href="http://morrisseymusic.com">Morrissey</a>’s <em>Who Put the ‘M’ in Manchester?</em> DVD. I’m a huge Morrissey fan… I realized how much recently. I loved The Smiths, of course, but if I were to name my ten favorite artists, I doubt Morrissey would appear on it. Yet every new CD he comes out with I buy and I like them. I don’t even have all The Smiths CDs but I have every Morrissey solo CD. And it wasn’t intentional, so I must really like his music. (I wonder what else I like ;) )</p>

<p>But the highlight of the DVD for me is a Smiths song, <em>There is a Light That Never Goes Out</em>. I haven’t listened to <em>The Queen Is Dead</em> in years so  had forgotten how great this song is. The crowd singing the morbidly romantic chorus is what does it:</p>

<blockquote>And if a double-decker bus
crashes into us,
To die by your side
Is such a heavenly way to die.

And if a 10-ton truck
kills the both of us,
To die by your side,
Well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine.
</blockquote>

<p>His latest CD, <em>You Are The Quarry</em>, is one of his best yet, so it’s great to see him continue to do well in his career.</p>

            <p>Our friends, Steve and Joseph, are in Buenos Aires and are sending us photos. Since he doesn’t have a blog either, I’m posting his most recent photo here. I don’t know what these things are (possums?) but there they are.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Geoffrey Moore, author of <em>Crossing The Chasm</em>, says <a href="http://news.com.com/2061-10795_3-5657784.html">Linux, Apache and MySQL made the leap</a> across the chasm from early-adopters to mainstream users. He also said that <a href="http://getfirefox.com">Firefox</a> hasn’t yet crossed the chasm. On <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a>, Firefox already has 7.8% of the market, just 2.2% short of their 2005 goal of 10%.</p>
