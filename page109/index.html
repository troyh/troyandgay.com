          </h3>
            <p>Eric and Valerie are going to sail to France so they had their going-away party tonight at the very cool <a href="http://www.bastilleseattle.com/">Bastille</a> at 7:30. That’s a little late for us early-birds to have dinner so Gay and I went to Maritime Brewery’s <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/jolly-roger-taproom-seattle">Jolly Roger brewpub</a> down the street for a beer and a light dinner (tiny burgers and oyster sandwiches) before the party.</p>

<p>At Bastille, we caught up with several people we haven’t seen in a long time and met some of Eric and Valerie’s friends. Eric and Valerie are renting out their house in Seattle and living on their boat for a couple weeks until they’re ready to sail. From Seattle, they’ll go to San Francisco and stay there for a few weeks. Then down to Mexico, through the Panama Canal, to Cuba (!), Bermuda and then across the ocean to the northern coast of France. The trip should take them a year. Seems dangerous to me but they’ve sailed across the Atlantic before and survived. They’re planning to find and buy a house in the Dordogne region of France and split their time between there and Seattle. Living the dream.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>A slowly-growing trend in craft beer is to package it in cans. 21st Amendment, which <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/17/21st-amendment-brewpub-review/">we visited</a> in 2008, is one of the few that does this now and we can finally get their beers locally so Gay picked some up recently. I look forward to getting more craft beer in a can – easier to carry, less prone to breakage, better protection from light and air and more eco-friendly.</p>

<p>This <em>Brew Free! or Die IPA</em> is delicious. We also got their <em>H__ell or High Watermelon Wheat</em>, which I’d heard good things about in spite of it being a wheat beer, but I didn’t like it at all.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>I’ve missed the rain; and the green grass. I hope it rains for the next few days.</p>

<p>We missed the first release of “Dry Fly”:http://www.dryflydistilling.com/main.php whiskey this weekend – all sold out state-wide. This is the first whiskey made in Washington since Prohibition from the first distillery in Washington since Prohibition. They will be releasing another batch around the holidays, we’ll have to be more on top of it then. We “visited”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/02/dry-fly-distillery/ Dry Fly last year.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We packed the kids in the car right after their midday naps and went to Newcastle, WA to Julie and Hans’ house for <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/07/20/gays-mom/">Gracelyn</a>’s 1st birthday party. On the way home I resisted the <a href="http://www.frys.com/isp/renton.html">Fry’s</a> in Renton and we went to get takeout at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/buddha-ruksa-seattle">Buddha Ruksa</a> in West Seattle. I’m not sure why we did because we weren’t very hungry after eating at the party, but we ate a little of it when we got home and left most of it for dinner tomorrow night.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Jonathan Alter understands <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/209817/page/1">why healthcare reform should be stopped</a> and we should just let the insurance companies decide who gets good healthcare:</p>

<p>bq. Speaking of fair, it seems fair to me that cost-cutting bureaucrats at the insurance companies–not doctors–decide what’s reimbursable. After all, the insurance companies know best.</p>

<p>They sure do! Have you ever known a corporation to put profits ahead of the best interests of their customers? It’s absurd. The Republicans are right, the free market cures all ills. It makes perfect sense that healthcare should be run by corporations. We’ve proven it, how else could the US healthcare be <a href="http://www.photius.com/rankings/healthranks.html">ranked 37th in the world</a> in quality even though it’s <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2006-02/2006-02-28-voa59.cfm?CFID=263963748&amp;CFTOKEN=95142258&amp;jsessionid=0030287987ee69d7d80d13797f7f329537e7">the most expensive healthcare in the world</a>? It beats those losers in Slovenia at #38. People who complain that we’re #37 in quality ignore that we’re #1 in cost! America is #1! Woo hoo! The free market in healthcare is working like a charm.</p>

<p>I’m so sick of Americans whining about having to pay high fees for healthcare or having healthcare that doesn’t work for them – if they don’t want to pay or don’t want to deal with insurance companies, they shouldn’t get diseases, inherit genes from their parents, have injuries, etc. And people who worry about children whose parents can’t afford healthcare for them. Those kids should’ve selected their parents more wisely. What were they doing for those nine months in the womb?! We deserve the best military and the best economy, but we certainly don’t deserve the best healthcare. Even William Kristol, the smartest guy on TV because he never sways from Republican talking points, <a href="http://www.indecisionforever.com/2009/07/28/jon-stewarts-extended-bill-kristol-interview/">agrees that Americans don’t deserve the best healthcare</a>.</p>

<p>Republicans is smart.</p>
