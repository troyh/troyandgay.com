              <p>It’s now been <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/17/19-years-without-mcdonalds/">over 20 years</a> since I’ve eaten at McDonald’s, and greasy fast food in general. This also means that it’s been 20 years since I’ve paid to sit on uncomfortable plastic furniture. Did you know that McDonald’s <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/tech/nextnews/archive/next031111.htm">designs their seating to be uncomfortable</a> so that you leave as soon as possible?: “Give us your money, get out and please come back again.”</p>

It’s definitely one of the top 3 dining experiences I’ve ever had, if not <em>the</em> best. It’s too bad that Seattle doesn’t have a restaurant of that caliber for special occasions.</p>

              <p>After our <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/09/01/back-to-the-house/">meeting with the architects</a>, we went to one of West Seattle’s newest restaurants, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/porterhouse-seattle">Porterhouse</a>. They have a really good beer selection – Gay had a half-pint of Menage a Frog, which we knew is great, and I had the <a href="http://www.bbaybrewery.com/">Boundary Bay</a> Double Dry Hopped IPA which was new to us and very good as well. The food was pretty good but standard pub food. I had the burger and Gay had the salmon sandwich. They had Deschutes’ <a href="http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/brews/reserve-series/mirror-mirror/default.aspx">Mirror Mirror</a> barleywine on tap and we couldn’t pass that up so we split a half-pint – it’s a lot more fun to have high alcohol beers when you don’t have to drive home – of that for dessert along with a scoop of <a href="http://www.mollymoonicecream.com/">Molly Moon’s</a> Salted Caramel ice cream and a chocolate tart.</p>

<p>While on the ferry home, Kelly called to tell us the fire alarms were going off in the house. Hudson slept right through them but Havana woke up and was scared. There was no fire in the house. She took them outside and away from the noise until we got home. It turns out that the batteries in one were low so all of them were beeping (loudly) to alert us about the need for fresh batteries. I understand safety is the best policy, but perhaps a little less shrill a sound for a low battery warning would suffice?</p>

              <p>The survey of the property complete, we are back to working with the architects to talk about location and basic structure of the house.</p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/l-2048-1536-f4a2b768-ea0a-43bc-8bb7-066c7d6864fc11.jpeg"><img src="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/l-2048-1536-f4a2b768-ea0a-43bc-8bb7-066c7d6864fc11.jpeg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>According to the survey, our property rises 50 feet (5 stories!) from the lowest point to the highest point. It sure doesn’t feel like that big a slope when you walk it, though. This makes it difficult to place the house given that moving dirt to level the grade is expensive and not always feasible.</p>

<p>They’ve worked up a couple ideas for the basic structure and location for the house, we gave our feedback and we’ll have another iteration soon.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Now that <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/08/30/snow-leopard-broke-control-and-caps-lock-swapping/">my huge problem</a> is solved, I can say what I really think of Snow Leopard: it’s definitely worth $29.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3864938283/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3491/3864938283_6762b087b8.jpg" alt="Snow Leopard (aka, &quot;Windows 3000&quot;)" /></a></p>

<p>Technically, we got the Family Pack so it cost us $49. On that topic, I love Apple’s Family Pack option. It’s totally unenforced, I could have bought the $29 version and installed it on several computers and Apple wouldn’t know, but I don’t because they offer a Family Pack option and trust me enough to pay what I really should pay for it. So I do it. This is something no one at Microsoft can get their heads around so they have onerous copy protection that ends up annoying legitimate people (like me!) more than pirates who seem to have no trouble at all pirating Windows. And on the topic of price, Microsoft is charging outrageous prices ($240 and up) for Windows 7 which only exists because Vista was such crap – Windows 7 should be free and come with a handwritten apology from every developer of Windows to everyone who suffered with their screwups. To their credit, they are offering a Family Pack with discounted pricing, but I’m sure it has the same annoying copy protection that always gets in your way.</p>

<p>Back to Snow Leopard…</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I gained 15GB of disk space after installing it. Apple claims people can get back up to 20GB, which is either impressive for Snow Leopard or shows how wasteful previous versions of OS X were. Nevertheless, when was the last time an OS upgrade gave you <em>more</em> disk space? I don’t think that’s ever happened for me, even Linux, the paragon of performance, gets bigger each version. That alone is worth $5-10 of the cost.</p>

<p>Snow Leopard is noticeably faster than Leopard. It’s not huge, 10% by some benchmarks, but it’s noticeable and appreciated. Apps seem to launch and run faster, waking up from sleep is faster, Dashboard is much faster, etc. This is not unusual, OSs are supposed to get faster with each release. Even Microsoft’s OSs used to do this: DOS 4, 5 and 6 each were faster than their predecessor and Windows 98 was much faster than Win95. Too bad Microsoft started getting lazy and relying on Intel to make computers faster.</p>

<p>Quicktime X is great simply because you can edit the videos without having to buy Quicktime Pro, which used to cost $30. I guess it has some fewer features than Pro does, but I never used them, I guess. And I love how it looks with the borderless window.</p>

<p>You can now have minimized apps get minimized into the Dock icon rather than to the right side of the Dock. I love this, I hated having a bunch of minimized icons sitting over there stretching out the Dock.</p>

<p>Exposé is easier to use, you just hold down the Dock icon and it shows you all the windows for the app. This is small but handy as I never got used to the F9 and F10 keys to do this.</p>

<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2009/08/mac-os-x-10-6.ars/">The definitive review</a> is much more in-depth.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Apple just released the first update (10.6.1) and it makes my Canon LIDE 60 scanner work natively with Image Capture! I don’t need Canon’s drivers or their terrible software to scan documents now. That alone is worth the $29 for Snow Leopard.</p>
