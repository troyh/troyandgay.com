              <p>After going into Seattle this morning, we went in again this evening for Stephanie &amp; Matt’s house-warming party. I haven’t gone into Seattle twice in the same day since the day we moved to Vashon and had to make a few trips back to the old house.</p>

<p>We were one of the first to get to the party and the first to leave at 11pm and raced to catch the 11:40 ferry. We barely made it but had we missed it we would have been taking the 1:50am ferry and would have gotten home at 2:30am. The ferries suck.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>We were invited to the <a href="http://netjets.com/">NetJets</a> open house today at <a href="http://www.kingcounty.gov/transportation/kcdot/airport.aspx">Boeing Field</a> so we went to get a chance to see what a private jet is like. NetJets is a “fractional ownership” (essentially a timeshare) plan for private jets and their partner, <a href="http://www.marquisjet.com/index.aspx">MarquisJet</a>, is a pay-by-the-hour plan for NetJets planes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3963696368/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3488/3963696368_8693ea826b.jpg" alt="NetJets Open House" /></a></p>

<p>The convenience of using NetJets would be great – no security lines, no waiting at the airport, shorter travel times, fly on your own schedule, bring your own beer (!), etc. But even with a MarquisJet card, flying in a private jet is at least 7x more expensive than flying commercial First Class, depending on how many people you put on a plane and where you’re going. I imagine that’ll come down in the next decade or two as the planes get less expensive to build and operate but commercial flying will always be more cost-effective (and far more eco-friendly).</p>

<p>We just went to sit in the planes to see what they’re like inside. They had three planes: a Citation XLS, a Gulfstream 200 and a Falcon 2000. The Citation XLS (seats 7) is very claustrophobic, I don’t think I’d like flying in one of those. The Gulfstream 200 (seats 9) and the Falcon 2000 (seats 10) were more roomy but not by much. I could at least stand up in them but the aisle is so narrow it’s hard to get around in it. I’d still prefer to fly commercial just because of the more space in the cabin.</p>

<p>We tried to go to <a href="http://www.hudsonseattle.com/">Hudson Restaurant</a>, which was just a couple minutes from Boeing Field, for lunch but they don’t allow kids in so we just took a photo of Hudson there and went to Zeek’s Pizza in West Seattle before going home.</p>

              <p>Hudson took his first steps by himself today, but just barely. He mostly falls forward while moving his feet but is starting to stand on his own and take steps. He loves it too, providing you catch him before he lands on his face.</p>
