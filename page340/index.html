          <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/team_onistr.jpg" alt="team_onistr.jpg" /><a href="http://www.hakalas.com">Troy’s brother</a> turned us on to this new show on the Spike TV network: <a href="http://www.spiketv.com/shows/meec/">Most Extreme Elimination Challenge</a>.  He characterized it as Jackass3, but it is much crazier than that.  Apparently a real Japanese show called <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/kevin.kempthorne/Takeshi/">“Takashi’s Castle”</a> where normal folks in incomprehensible costumes endure ridiculous and straining physical challenges (41 people have broken their ribs in the show’s 2 seasons!) is then re-dubbed with subtle and not subtle ribald humor.  It sounds so stupid when I try to explain it…there is a real iron-chef-meets-beavis-and-butthead thing going on.   (thurs, sat &amp; sun at 9)</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.s1m0ne.com/">S1m0ne</a> sucked. Hollywood is fake, plastic, naive, and more than a little stupid, so when Hollywood tries to expose itself, you get a plastic story filled with naive characters and lots of stupidity. But don’t despair, you still get the obligatory rekindled relationship happiness and the “Who am I and what is life about?” drivel that Hollywood thinks pass for meaning. And what was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199/">Al Pacino</a> thinking?</p>

          <p>I haven’t watched a horror movie in a long time, so fortunately, <a href="http://www.ring-themovie.com/">The Ring</a> was a little better than the average horror movie, but not by much. Not much to say about it, people die of course through evil magic. But it was set in Seattle and some parts were even filmed in Seattle (most Seattle movies are filmed in Vancouver) and one scene included a ride on a ferry (the <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/your_wsf/our_fleet/index.cfm?vessel_id=54">Quinault</a>).</p>
