          <p>My mom is visiting (and cooking for us – yum!).  Mark &amp; Lee have finally moved back to Seattle (so our guest room is empty of furniture again – bad).  The weather here has been terrible so our house has no paint on it. I’m training for the <a href="http://www.seattlemarathon.org/">Seattle half-marathon</a> with my friend Megan – doing 8 miles this weekend.  We’ve been doing more hardware upgrades for <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> which never quite go as planned – in fact, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000668GF/recipezaar-20/104-0474988-1243147">Troy’s cel phone</a> was a casualty of the installation – but more annoying is that we work so dang hard and then people in our bulletin boards cause a ruckus and we then have to spend hours sending warning letters and generally baby-sitting people who are supposed to be adults – annoying – keeping us from doing our real jobs.</p>

          <p>“We’ve had no evidence that Saddam Hussein was involved with the September 11th,” Bush said in an impromptu session with reporters. He contended, however, that “there’s no question that Saddam Hussein had Al Qaeda ties.” (<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-2connectsep18,1,314262.story?coll=la-headlines-world">LA Times</a>)</p>

<p>The United States has “ties” to Al Qaeda, for goodness sakes!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hans Blix “believes that Iraq destroyed most of its weapons of mass destruction 10 years ago, but kept up the appearance that it had them to deter a military attack.” (<a href="http://www.drudgereportarchives.com/goto/?getPage=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elasvegassun%2Ecom%2Fsunbin%2Fstories%2Ftext%2F2003%2Fsep%2F17%2F091702041%2Ehtml&amp;return=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Edrudgereportarchives%2Ecom%2Fdsp%2Flinks%5Frecap%2Ehtm">Associated Press</a>)  His team was given 3 months to find WMD, but in the 5 months since the overthrow the 1,400 person team of scientists, military and intelligence experts still haven’t found anything more. (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/09/18/sprj.irq.blix.bush/index.html">CNN</a>)</p>

<p>As I recall, we were sold this war on the basis of WMD that could be used against us by terrorists…<a href="http://www.nobodydied.com">Nobody died when Clinton Lied</a></p>

<p>…number of Iraqis killed so far: 6,000.</p>

          <p>I loved <a href="http://www.friendster.com">Friendster</a> as much as the next guy for the 20 minutes I played on it, but I just don’t see how it is worth <a href="http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B6931E0FF-BA12-423D-AC28-DA40DE825989%7D&amp;siteid=mktw&amp;dist=nbi">$10 million</a>.  Does anyone remember “I kiss you” the dancing Arab guy meme? Am I Hot or Not? Sure there have been sites that have generated enormous traffic, but where are they now?  Certainly not making $10MM.  What am I missing that these classic dot com investors get (Yahoo, PayPal, etc.)?  I understand the network effects and online dating applications for Friendster, but …</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/icanndns/">Sign this petition for the all the reasons</a>, but the gist is that VeriSign (which runs all the .com and .net domain listings by virtue of purchasing Network Solutions) is putting up an advertisement page if you try to hit any unregistered .com domain, rather than just letting your web browser serve you an error.  This is bad.  They are profiting from an international body (remember they are only a government authorized monopoly for <em>selling domains</em> not putting up ads in any unused space – it is as if the phone company was allowed to make you listen to an ad every time you dialed a wrong number.  The good news is that the internet is already routing around the problem: the company that makes domain resolving software which runs on 80% of the servers that resolve domain names into machine-readable addresses is issuing a patch that will prevent this type of squatting….</p>

<p>The internet is a beautiful place, but lets not forget that there are infrastructure providers that could quickly make it a very controlled environment if we don’t work to protect it.</p>

          <p><a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> is up to <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=recipezaar.com">8,800</a> on <a href="http://www.alexa.com">Alexa</a>’s ranking system. That means there are only 8,799 sites that are bigger in traffic.</p>

<p>It’s only one system for ranking sites and isn’t always the same as what we see internally, but it’s as good a barometer as any. But the most interesting thing is that our biggest competitors (<a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=allrecipes.com">AllRecipes</a>, <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=epicurious.com">Epicurious</a>, <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=foodtv.com">FoodTV</a>), with millions of dollars in funding and marketing, are continuing to fall while Recipezaar continues to rise. I remember when they were hundreds of times bigger than us, now they’re just 3-4 times bigger. I like the trend.</p>
