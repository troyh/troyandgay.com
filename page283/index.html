          <p>First Howard Dean <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/12/001862.php">advertises</a> on Recipezaar, now we just realized that John Kerry is advertising. Bush has bajillions for his campaign, why isn’t he spending some of it on Recipezaar?! Or Nader? I’d like to complete the set.</p>

          <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/hillary55.jpg" alt="hillary55.jpg" />I think Hillary Clinton would make a wonderful president or vice-president, and I simply do not understand why smart intelligent women (like my mother), who agree with Hillary’s position on every issue, despise her.  As is usually the case with smart powerful women, the public would rather believe the hype that she is some lunatic bitch than actually listen to her.  Anyways, the Senator from New York has written <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/18/magazine/18POLICY.html">a terrific piece on the problems with our current health care system</a>.  She articulates the real business and economic reasons for changing the system, as well as looks at our changing health care needs.  Consider: _Automakers in the United States and Canada pay taxes to help finance public health care. But in the United States, automakers also pay about $1,300 per midsize car produced for private employee health insurance. Automakers in Canada come out ahead, according to recent news reports, even after paying higher taxes. At the same time, American companies are outsourcing jobs to countries where the price of labor does not include health coverage, which costs Americans jobs and puts pressure on employers who continue to cover their employees at home. _</p>

          <p>How do businesses expect to make money in the bandwidth business? In 2000, we had a T1 line (that’s 1.5Mbps) installed and paid $1200/month and that was the best price at the time. Today, we can get a 5Mbps line for $350/mo. That’s over 3x faster for less than 30% of the cost. Not quite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s Law</a> yet, but at this rate, by 2012 bandwidth will essentially be free.</p>

What you can’t tell from the photo of the shakers I received is that they are joined by a little magnet at the hip.
Funny: I sent “people” shakers too. The hula people lift up out of their little grass skirts too. They must have crossed each other somewhere across the Pacific Ocean!</p>

Gay is in a salt &amp; pepper shaker swap and we just got these very cool shakers from someone in New Zealand.</p>
