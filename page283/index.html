            <p>TiVo is set to announce <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/09/technology/09net.html">a download service</a> so I can download movies directly to my TiVo. No more waiting weeks for the new movies to be available on DVD, I should be able to watch movies the night they’re released on video. Bye bye Netflix.</p>

            <p>This <a href="http://www.seattleweekly.com/features/0422/040602_news_microsoft.php">article</a> sums up my feelings almost exactly. Microsoft is not successful today because people love its products, because most people curse Windows and Office daily. They are successful for other reasons, not the least of which was years of infamous business practices. And eventually (and soon) that will come to an end.</p>

<p>When I left, I was pretty loyal to Microsoft, although the truths that the antitrust trial brought out left a bad taste in my mouth. But since then I’ve also discovered how wonderful OS X is and how useful Linux is. Although neither are perfect (yet), I live the life I dreamed about when I was 12. I like computers again.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>When you make a software product (or any product, I imagine), you spend months or years getting it ready for market, with a very stressful 24/7 work load in the weeks before the release date.  Well, we are in the stressful, chaotic final 8 weeks before Wedding Launch version 1.0 (there will be no updates)!  I’ve got the dress, the photographer, and (finally) an officiant.  We’ve sent the invitations, and we’ve done the one thing that probably means the most only to us: we have <a href="/wedding/">a website</a>.</p>

<p>What’s there to stress about?  The only problem is that we decided to have the wedding at our home, which has meant a garden “clean-up” that has gotten somewhat out of hand.  Two weeks into the job and 11 trees have come down, 8 cords of wood split and “gifted” to neighbors, half an acre of sod removed, 50 yards of soil delivered, approximately 40 rhododendrons and perhaps as many azaleas moved, and there is still a back hoe sitting in our yard, aka our wedding site.  Actually the end is in sight, and I am finally beginning to relax and sleep through the night.</p>

<p>The funny thing is that it is doubtful many folks will even realize the changes we have made, just that the place looks really nice.  We’ll know – we do know already – and we’ll get to enjoy the investment for years and years to come.  Despite the additional worry, we are very lucky to have this celebration at such a special place to us, and our life together.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>I bought the Apple wireless mouse &amp; keyboard as soon as they came out months ago. I’ve tried and tried to like them, but they’re both worthless. They go through batteries like crazy, they seem to require the most expensive “camera” batteries, and they lose their connections constantly. And the mouse loses its connection when I bump it into the keyboard every time! The mouse is also insanely sensitive to dirt on your desk. I can’t even begin to count the number of times I’ve clicked the wrong thing because the mouse jumps 2cm a split second before I press the button.</p>

<p>Yeah, I’ve talked to Apple (they have “zero reported problems” although their message boards are full of people with the same problems) and they blame the D-Link bluetooth adapter (the only one they recommend you use). Other people tell me that the USB port is the problem, although I’ve tried 6 USB ports on my computer.</p>

<p>They’re just junk, plain and simple.</p>
