            <p>Yeah, I don’t remember Easter being such a big holiday either. When I was a kid, we went to church, of course, and had a brunch and egg hunt (that Thom McAnn golden egg my parents hid had $5 in it every year!), but other than that, it was a normal Sunday, I thought. And in college, I was always surprised that my Greek friends always made such a big deal about Easter – Easter is bigger than Christmas in the Greek Orthodox church. Has Easter become more celebrated recently? I’m all for the eating holidays, and I understand the religious significance of the event, but….</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We are trying to get our yard in shape (esp. as it will be the site of our big summer party, a.k.a. our wedding, later this summer).  We spent most of the weekend in various suburban pursuits: pressure washing, weed-pulling, tree-pruning, boring plant removal, spraying to prevent the <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/06/001464.php#001464">dreaded tent moths</a>, etc..  The place is really shaping up, and we are working an arborist friend to pick plants and rearrange things.  Plant suggestions welcome – I <em>think</em> we live in zone 6.
We did manage a much-needed break yesterday with friends Mike &amp; Kiernan to spoil our dogs with a trip to the beach.  BTW, when did this Easter holiday become such a big deal?  Vashon doesn’t have much of a downtown as it is, but what little we do have was closed yesterday, making our plan for beach-take-out-lunch a bit difficult.  Mike’s Jewish, so I can’t blame him, but I was raised Catholic and I didn’t realize how big it has gotten.  I suppose if we had kids instead of dogs we’d hunt eggs too, but do all the restaurants have to close as well….</p>

            <p>Condoleezza Rice, under oath, said she did not know of any threats against American targets within the US before 9/11/2001. The next day, the Bush Administration agrees to declassify the PDB from August 6, 2001 “not before Monday”. The very next day, the day before a big US holiday, they release the PDB. Clearly the lie about the release and the actual release were planned to give the US people time to forget about the incredible inconsistencies between it and the previous claims.</p>

<p>The PDB states that Bin Laden is planning domestic US attacks and that two of the hijackers were in the US. Until now, the Bush Administration stated that they knew nothing about such info. They lied. This is not a Clinton lie about an extra-marital affair, this is a lie about the national security of the United States. Worse, they did absolutely nothing about the info they had. They claim they notified the FBI, but the FBI has no record of any notification. Obviously, the Bush Administration did not take these threats seriously. Granted, hindsight is 20/20, but not even a call to the FAA to alert them something may be planned?</p>
