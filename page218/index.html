<p>We, on behalf of Recipezaar, just donated to our favorite radio station, <a href="http://kexp.org">KEXP</a>. It’s a public-supported radio station and its what we listen to all day while we sit at our computers every day, we’ve found out about the majority of the music we listen to these days, so we figure we owe them something. And I can’t help but want to support non-corporate music. :)</p>

<p>Yikes, if I knew they’d read the email I sent <em>verbatim</em> I’d have written something more clever or interesting. It probably sounds dumb out of context, but if you heard the entire show they were getting punch drunk after being up for hours during their pledge drive – they’re normally less giggly. <a href="/pix/kexp.wav">Listen to the clip</a>.</p>

          <p>We live in a pretty small and pretty rural area that luckily publishes a weekly paper.  We like to joke that the local high school paper, The Riptide, has a higher standard of journalism than <a href="http://www.vashonbeachcomber.com/">The Beachcomber</a>.  But like all Vashon Islanders, I don’t know what I’d do without the weekly Police Beat.  Example today:</p>

<blockquote>**Sheriff's Log Febuary 8th**:
POT ON THE BUS
Several students riding the bus to Vashon High School complained that one youth was smoking marijuana.  The report doesn't say what action was taken.
</blockquote>

<p>I’d love to have a blog where people send in the best in Rural news gems like this.  The following headlne is what inspired the discussion:</p>

<blockquote>**[
It's Never Too Early to Start Talking About Sex With Kids](http://www.vashonbeachcomber.com/portals-code/list.cgi?paper=90&amp;cat=48&amp;id=384088&amp;more=)**
While it is widely recognized that parents are a child’s primary sexuality educator, is it ever too early to begin “sex-ed” lessons? The answer is no.  Even with newborns...</blockquote>

          <p>Classic tech industry vaporware hype. Apple conceives, designs, builds, manufactures and ships the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac mini</a>. <a href="http://news.com.com/Photos+Intels+own+mini+PC/2009-1042_3-5596587.html?part=rss&amp;tag=5587315&amp;subj=news">Intel’s makes one cardboard mini PC</a> and it’s news as if they actually did something.</p>

<p>But, of course, Apple’s <em>real</em> version looks good:</p>

<p>while Intel’s looks like a bad copy:</p>

<p>After <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=2985">our previous surprise mention</a>, the food editor for the Washington Post called to interview us (Gay does all the talking for us, as you’d expect) and the  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62485-2005Mar1.html">the follow-up article</a> on <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> ran in today’s edition:</p>

<p><em>“We wanted to make eating easier through technology,” Gilmore says. Recipezaar.com accomplishes that goal by offering free features such as personalized online cookbooks and automatic shopping lists of ingredients. Often the recipes come with good-quality photos.</em></p>

<p>I grew up in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=2740%20viking%20drive%2C%20herndon%2C%20va%20">the Washington, DC area</a> so it’s nice that my hometown newspaper (finally) recognized me. ;)</p>
