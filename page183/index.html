          </h3>
            <p>Our neighbors <em>finally</em> sold their house and moved. Price: $150,000. The new owners are cleaning it up so we got the chance to go inside and check it out. Bear in mind that the house has been cleaned up by the new owners.</p>

<p>We affectionately refer to them as “The Pigs” because they used to own two pot-bellied pigs that roamed the property and we never knew their last name.</p>

<p>h1. History (as we heard it)</p>

<p>When we met the father, Ed, we were walking our dogs and he called us over to introduce himself. A couple minutes into the conversation he announced that he doesn’t molest his children. He explained that no matter what we heard (we hadn’t heard anything… yet) and no matter what the court documents said, he did not molest his daughter. He explained that the neighbors are all out to get him and make him look bad.</p>

<p>The mother grew up in the house, so she’s lived there for 40+ years! She was given the house by her father who -lives in California now- +still lives on Vashon+. We later heard that their oldest daughter was taken away from them because he had molested her. She lives in Seattle or California and has never returned to the house.</p>

<p>Their 22-year old son lived there off and on and did petty crimes in the neighborhood; he stole our mail twice once getting a DVD (sorry Netflix!) and he broke into another neighbor’s classic Mercedes to get spare change and ferry tickets. We filed a police report and the first thing the officer said was “Jonathan’s back in town.” We’d see him in downtown Vashon on occassion hanging out in the park. He mostly seemed to live in a van parked on the property.</p>

<p>The parents divorced and she started dating some new guy, who started out looking okay but he devolved into a crystal-meth smoker. Gay once ran into him at the grocery store buying a single beer with change. Everyone knows classy people buy lots of beer with a credit card. :)</p>

<p>Other neighbors, Bill and Milly, a sweet older couple who have lived here for 30 years, have a long history with them and lots of police involvement. Ed explained to us that Bill was the biggest drug-dealer in Washington State and also a pimp running a large prostitution ring that included Ed’s own wife against her will. Crystal meth apparently makes you a paranoid delusional.</p>

<p>The saddest thing (besides the alleged child molestation) was the two youngest kids, Amanda (12?) and “Li’l Joe” (7?), lived in this house and rarely went to school. Amanda was like the pretty girl in The Munsters and very polite. Li’l Joe seemed to have a learning disability. Both stopped going to school and we’d see Li’l Joe playing barefoot in the mud in the front yard in the winters.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago we heard that they had sold the place but didn’t believe it. Then I ran into the guy who bought it. He buys property, fixes it up and flips them. We’ll see how much he puts into this place.</p>

<p>h1. Photos</p>

<p>You can only imagine the smell of this place. Be thankful that there’s no smell-o-vision. And this is very cleaned up, the yard used to be full of cars, broken appliances, furniture and tons of trash.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Consumer Reports gave “my car”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/01/05/new-car-2008-lexus-ls-460/, the Lexus LS 460L, “99 out of 100 points”:http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/new-cars/news/2007/04/top-picks-for-2007-4-07/overview/0704_top-picks-2007.htm and ranked it #1 in the Luxury Sedan category in their 2008 Best &amp; Worst Cars:</p>

<p>bq. With a score of 99 out of 100 in our road test, the LS is our highest-rated vehicle. It provides a no-compromise environment of comfort and roominess, coupled with an isolating quietness. It also delivers quick acceleration and relatively good fuel economy. This car is brimming with electronic amenities, but the controls are easy to use. “See the video”:http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1329233564/bclid1432845447/bctid1407927650</p>

<p>I’m not a fan of Consumer Reports and their empty/half/full circle rating scheme and the emphasis they put on things consumers shouldn’t care about – or, at least, the things I don’t care about – but they do occasionally get things right. :)</p>

<p>And I don’t have the LS 460L, I have the LS 460 (no L).</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Buying something that is made in the US <em>just because it’s made in the US</em> is bad for the US. And if you’re paying more to buy patriotically, it’s bad for you personally. It seems like it’s a good idea to help your fellow Americans to buy products they make, and it <em>is</em> good for <em>those</em> people, but it’s bad for everyone else in the country. Trade with other countries helps the US prosper.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Imagine you want to buy a product and have a choice of one made in your country and one made in another country. Assuming that both are of equal quality (or good enough quality for your needs), you should buy the cheaper one, regardless of where it’s made. If you buy the one made in the US, you pay more, leaving less money for you to buy other things. Having less money is bad for you. It’s also bad for the US because you didn’t give any money to the people in the other country.</p>

<p>How can giving money to another country help the US? The people in the other country are just like you, they need products too. The money you send to them when you buy things allows them to buy American-made products, if they choose. If a US company produces the better product for them, the Americans who make that product profit.</p>

<p>Why do we need the other country to buy from us? There are 6 billion people in the world, i.e., potential buyers of American-made products. There are 300 million Americans, that’s 5% of the world’s consumers. If America doesn’t sell products to the rest of the world, every American needs to spend 20 times more on American-made products than they do now. If you have 2 TVs, you need to buy 38 more (assuming you can find an American-made TV). If you buy a case of Coca-Cola a month, you need to buy 20 cases per month – if you can’t drink that much, just pour it down the drain and be happy that you’re helping the employees of Coca-Cola you’ll never meet. You have to do this for <em>every</em> product you buy. Americans simply can’t do that any more than the people in other countries can do that. So we do need other countries to buy American-made products.</p>

<p>What if we buy foreign-made products but the other country doesn’t play fair and refuses to buy from the US? Even better! This is called a “trade surplus” in your country (your country exports more than it imports) and a “trade deficit” in the other country (their country imports more than it exports). A trade surplus is good for your country for the same reason it’s good for you personally: if you received (imported) more goods than you paid for (exported), you’d be pretty happy. Obviously, it’s in the best interests of the other country to get something back when they send something to your country, so they will buy from US companies too.</p>

<p>And if they still refuse to trade? Technically, trade is not about exchanging actual products, trade is done in money. US dollars are given to the other country. If the other country takes the dollars but doesn’t spend them, they are essentially burning the pieces of paper the dollars are printed on. Less dollars in existence makes you wealthier because each of your dollars are worth more than they used to be. So if we take their products and give them money they don’t use, they’ve been cheated, not the US.</p>

<p>But they will just exchange dollars into their currency and they’ve still cheated the US, right? They can’t do that. Exchanging currency is not magic where one currency is transformed into the other. When you exchange currency you are selling one currency and accepting another currency as payment. If no one wants the currency you’re trying to sell, it’s worthless, just like trying to sell anything that no one wants. If they are refusing to buy American-made products, dollars don’t help them so no one will want dollars because there’s nothing they can buy with them. So dollars are worthless to them in that case. Once again, they’ve essentially burned the dollars you gave them, which makes you wealthier.</p>

<p>So if we trade with them, they will trade with us.</p>

<p>What about the dangers of making other countries wealthy enough to threaten us economically and/or militarily? This is one-sided thinking. The belief here is that money goes from your country to the other country but money never returns to your country from the other country. As I explained above, that won’t happen. Well, it won’t happen unless the US makes lousy products that people in the other country don’t want. But if US companies continue to make products people want, the US will be fine economically and, thanks to taxes, militarily as well. So the companies in the US have to compete. What’s new about that?   Competition makes you stronger, lack of competition makes you lazy and weaker. Buying American-made products simply because they’re American-made makes America lazy and weak.</p>
