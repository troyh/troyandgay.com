<p>I kegged a batch of beer today that I brewed almost four weeks ago, an IPA(India Pale Ale). It’s my first batch in six months. I want to brew more regularly now.</p>

            <p>We took the car to the Lexus dealer in Bellevue for its complimentary 1,000-mile checkup and the optional Lexus Personalized Settings change (some personalization settings require the dealer to do it).</p>

<p>Lexus tries to make their dealerships a more pleasant experience, even “making some into spas”:http://carsdiva.wordpress.com/2008/01/14/five-star-hotels-spas-and-car-dealerships/, and “Lexus of Bellevue”:http://www.lexusofbellevue.com/ is no exception. We pulled up to the service entrance, parked the car and went into the service area, which is a row of “offices” for the “Service Representatives”, who are all well-dressed and polite. The woman shook our hand, introduced herself, asked us to sit while she entered the work items into the computer. Once she was done, she asked us if we wanted to be taken somewhere while we waited. Rather than be given a trip to a shopping center, we opted to hang out at the dealer. We had free bottled water and a cookie, walked around the showroom (and were never harassed by a salesman), browsed through the Lexus shop, went outside to the putting greens and played fake golf, then came back in for some espresso and TV in one of the many lounge areas that are as nice as a decent hotel’s lobby. WiFi is available throughout the place and they even have a playroom for kids. There were several customers around the dealership reading one of several newspapers offered, some with laptops doing work, all looking very comfortable. It took two hours, but it was the most enjoyable two hours I’ve ever spent at a car dealer.</p>

<p>We were also recently at the Jeep dealer having work done on it and the difference is night-and-day. At the “Jeep dealer”:http://www.townandcountryjeep.com/, you drive the car into the garage with all the mechanics using power tools, so it’s hard to talk to the gruff service desk guy. You fill out your own paperwork telling them what you want them to do, they take your keys and they look at you like “Why are you still here?”. The dealership is like walking into the 1970s; you can have some coffee but it’s one of those Bunn commercial coffee makers you find in office lunch rooms. And they have one couch to sit on. Not surprisingly, no one was waiting at the dealership.</p>

            <p>With all the bleak talk about our economy and the lousy performance of the stock market over “the last year”:http://finance.google.com/finance?chdnp=0&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=1&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1204664400000&amp;chddm=98923&amp;q=INDEXSP:.INX (down 5.61%), I wondered if the stock market is <em>really</em> lower than it should be right now. I plotted the value of the S&amp;P 500 since January 2, 1990 and compared it to the desired 10% annual growth rate:</p>

<p>The green line shows what the stock market would have done had it done a stable 10% return every year. The blue line shows the actual prices of the S&amp;P 500. So, yes, the stock market is lower than where it “should be” right now. The dot-com bubble and crash were bad, but today we’re almost at the historical peak.</p>

<p>“Roethlisberger signed a $102 million 8-year contract”:http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08063/862127-66.stm?cmpid=steelers.xml. He’s the highest-paid Steeler ever and possibly the highest-paid player in the NFL. That’s justified… he’s been one of the top 3 QBs in all of his only 4 years in the NFL, including a Super Bowl win. I hope the Steelers can improve their offensive line this year to protect Roethlisberger better than they have the last couple years. But they made it harder by letting Alan Faneca go. “He signed with the New York Jets”:http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08062/861895-66.stm?cmpid=steelers.xml becoming the highest-paid offensive lineman in NFL history with a $40 million 5-year contract.</p>

          </h3>
            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/blog/pix/2008/03/seattle.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Today is the 11-year anniversary of my first day at Microsoft. I remember this because of the date: 3/3. How did I end up here? I had always wanted to move to San Francisco since visiting the area several times on business. My employer, a software consulting company, was trying to open an office in San Jose and they were going to have me open the office. They dragged their feet for almost a year and by that time, Microsoft offered me a job so I took it so I could at least get to the west coast. I figured getting to the west coast and having it completely paid-for by Microsoft would make it easier to eventually move to San Francisco.</p>

<p>My plan was to work at Microsoft for several years, say 5 or so, and then start my own software company in San Francisco. I met Gay, we started dating in 1998, I quit Microsoft in 1999 and somehow convinced Gay to start a software business with me. I’m still here in Seattle even though I told myself I’d never want to live in rainy Seattle for long. It turns out that I love Seattle, including the rain.</p>
