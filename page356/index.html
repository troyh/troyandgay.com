The music industry is <em>finally</em> getting the message that Napster/Gnutella/Kazaa sent. Anyone who downloaded music on the internet should pat themselves on the back. And if you didn’t, be sure to give the sales clerk a $4-6 tip on each CD you buy.</p>

<p>I think CD prices should be under $10, actually, and this is just one company. But this is a promising start!</p>

<p>This is another case of the feds covering up the fact that they just can’t catch the original worm author (or any worm author, for that matter) so they’re going to pretend like they caught him. And people will believe it. Although this kid should be held responsible for his actions, he did very little in comparison (3%?) to the original Blaster worm.</p>

              <p>Using <a href="http://mywireservice.com">MyWireService</a> is an incredibly interesting thing… today’s Labor Day in the US, so there’s very little news in the US. The big news is that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/01/obituaries/01BRON.html?ex=1377835200&amp;en=c368734b32d384f2&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">Charles Bronson died</a>. But in Europe, the big headlines are all about <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Politics/kelly/story/0,13747,1033585,00.html?=rss">David Kelly</a> and that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/click/rss/0.91/public/-/1/hi/world/europe/3196609.stm">Libya has agreed to a settlement payout</a> for the 1989 <a href="http://www.cnn.com/LAW/trials.and.cases/case.files/0010/lockerbie/">Lockerbie bombing</a> (it’ll probably take them another 14 years to actually pay). It’s amazing how I can get up-to-speed on the news of the day in less than 10 minutes by visiting one web site.</p>

              <p>Trying to continue a relaxing Labor Day weekend, woke up early (7:30am) and had coffee outside. Made blackberry pancakes for breakfast with blackberries from our yard. Rearranged some furniture and then went to install <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/08/001667.php#001667">my new hard drive</a> in a machine. No luck, a 200GB exceeds the EIDE 137GB limit so I’d lose 63GBs. Argh. Went to wash and vacuum the car with Gay and then took the dogs to the Zoomies drive-in, a Vashon Island fast food place (that should be called “Slowies”), for burgers and fries. They give the dogs free little ice cream cones, which is pretty cute. <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/04/001362.php">Ouzo</a> hates when we spray <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/templates/brand/default.asp?brand=1775&amp;aid=334009&amp;aparam=binaca">Binaca</a> in his mouth when <a href="http://www.papd.org/animal/behavior/quietcommand.html">he barks</a> at pedestrians.</p>

<p>Lunch outside in the end of summer Seattle weather. Back to the hard drive… after learning a lot about IDE and the <a href="http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/bios/sizeGB128-c.html">137 GB limit</a>, and the <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/B/BIOS.html">BIOS</a> in a circa 1999 machine, just decided to upgrade to a later version of the <a href="http://kernel.org">Linux kernel</a> and it worked like a charm! Then dinner and the first part of <a href="http://www.lordoftherings.net/index_400_hv_presell.html">Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers</a>. Quiet. Relaxing.</p>
