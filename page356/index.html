              <p>My dad was <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/08/001644.php">recently diagnosed</a> with hydrocephalus. Unfortunately, he was diagnosed by a neurosurgeon, not a neurologist. After talking to a couple doctor friends we have, they stressed the importance of having a neurologist examine him before deciding it’s hydrocephalus. And his regular doctor never suggested a 2nd opinion (or even a 1st opinion, for that matter), which seems suspect.</p>

<p>So I’ve been trying to get them to want a 2nd opinion. But they’re full of excuses, such as the neurologist is 50 miles away, or “they probably don’t know either” or it’s just too inconvenient. Sometimes people confuse me. Before I get brain surgery, I’m going to have 3, 4 or 5 opinions. And part of the reason they’re convinced their neurosurgeon is smart is because “he talks fast”. That’s not smart, that’s a very poor bedside manner.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/adaptation-superbit/index.html">Adaptation</a> was an interesting movie. Kaufmann is a creative writer and Nicolas Cage was impressive as was the trick photography used to make these characters interact with each other.</p>

<p>The movie is intertwined with itself on several levels. The movie was about the writing of the screenplay adaptation of a book, a screenplay that included the characters from <a href="http://www.susanorlean.com/articles/orchid_fever.html">the real-life story</a>, the movie mirrored the actual thought process behind the screenwriting and the characters adapted to life the way the subject of the movie/book/article, orchids, adapt to their environment. All in all, very clever, interesting and entertaining.</p>

              <p>After over three months without my iBook, I’ve finally got it back and am posting this with it! Earlier this year, my iBook started exhibiting the “Angle of Death” problem: if the screen is opened to too large an angle, the screen would go black. I needed a replacement cable so I disassembled the iBook. That is <em>not</em> advisable, there are a zillion tiny little screws of differing sizes and you have to completely disassemble the entire laptop. A couple screws wouldn’t even come out so I had to drill them out.</p>

<p>The replacement cable wasn’t even easy to order. It took several calls and emails to <a href="http://smalldog.com">SmallDog</a>, but I finally got it. After disassembling the laptop, I was skeptical that the new cable would fix it since the old one didn’t look frayed as I expected it to be. But I put the new one in anyway and I got it all put back together this evening, powered it up and it works great. I’ve got a few extra screws somehow, though.</p>

              <p>This morning I got a comment to my <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/07/001588.php">I hate Google</a> post that was clearly very angry and very defensive about Google from someone who clearly didn’t understand what I was talking about. I deleted it since it was full of expletives. I thought it was weird to get a comment on such an old post but then I did a search on Google for “I hate Google” and it’s the #2 item in the results.</p>

<p>Google is a good search engine (I use it almost exclusively) but they’re not perfect and they clearly made some mistakes when designing GoogleAds. And yes, I do think that Google has too much power already.</p>
