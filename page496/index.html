            <p>Motley Fool article, <a href="http://www.fool.com/news/take/2002/mft/mft02090601.htm">Fool.com: Bill Gross Negative on Stocks</a>, historically <em>stocks do not follow earnings growth, as Peter Lynch says on his commercials. Rather, dividend yields matter most to stock returns.</em> So, even if corporations do increase earnings in the future (not a sure thing, IMO) the stock market still may not recover. Look for undervalued stocks with a P/E lower than the S&amp;P average P/E of 21.</p>

            <p>We went to Bellevue for a meeting with Jeff Crosby (&amp; associates) about our investments. Now, we’re considering just putting it all in indexes (S&amp;P 500, Russell 2000, etc) and cutting out the middleman (Jeff). How hard can it be??</p>

<em>For those that have recently purchased new Linux servers, 31 percent were adding capacity, 31 percent were replacing Windows systems, 24 percent were replacing Unix and 14 percent were replacing other operating systems.</em>. In other words, of the people buying Linux to replace another OS, 45% are replacing Windows. This is contrary to previous reports that Linux was replacing Unix exclusively.</p>
