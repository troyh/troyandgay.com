              <p>Gay finally got a jogging stroller, the “B.O.B. IronMan”:http://www.bobgear.com/strollers/stroller.php?product_id=9 and took it out for its maiden voyage (and to get the mail on the way home):</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>The S&amp;P lost another 5.74% today. The Nasdaq lost 5.8% and the Dow lost 5.11%. Did you know that at no time in the history of the stock market has a 10-year period been negative? That is, until now. For the first time ever in America, had you invested money in the stock market (i.e, the S&amp;P 500), ten years ago, you would have less money today. 4.64% less to be exact. If you account for inflation at, say, 2.5%/year you’d have lost an additional 28%. So, in real dollar terms, you’d have lost more than 32%, or almost one-third of your money. You really would have been better-off with your money in your mattress for the last decade (unless your mattress burned).</p>

<p>Before this recent 10-year span, the worst the market has ever done is +7.8%, in 1972-1982. In other words, the worst decade before this one was almost 3 times better than this last decade. Check out “the chart”:http://finance.google.com/finance?chdnp=0&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=1&amp;chdet=1223411475411&amp;chddm=1004061&amp;q=INDEXSP:.INX&amp;ntsp=0 and step back a year at at time to see for yourself.</p>

<p>It’s yet another reason why George W. Bush will go down as the worst President ever. One could argue that the President has nothing to do with the economy, but if Presidents take credit when it does well, they have to take credit when it doesn’t.</p>

<p>Let’s get a Democrat in the White House, because <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/31/democrats-are-better-for-the-economy/">the economy is always better under a Democrat</a> than a Republican.</p>

              <p>Somehow, olabimtan777@yahoo.com got a hold of our credit card number and bought porn software and subscribed to several porn sites between Sep 22 and 24. Apparently, he lives in Niger, the world capital of credit card fraud and is looking for “a team to play soccer with”:http://www.sportisgood.com/sp/dispatch?cmd=PlayerView&amp;profileID=1385&amp;section=5 and for <a href="http://profile.passion.com/view/135465584_10990.html">dates</a>, specifically:</p>

<p>bq. Women, Couples (man and woman), Groups, Couples (2 women), Couples (2 men) or TS/TV/TG for Erotic Chat or Email, Discreet Relationship or Other “Alternative” Activities.</p>

<p>I love his description of himself:</p>

<p>bq. am such a cool and honest guy that is very caring but i hate one thing i hate lies</p>

<p>An honest guy who hates lies but has no problem with theft. He’s a catch!</p>

<p>This is the second time our credit card number has been stolen in a year! The “first time”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/31/credit-card-number-stolen/ was in February. It’s never happened in 20 years of using credit cards, but now it’s twice in one year. Given that we shop online almost exclusively and only at reputable companies (Amazon, Netflix, iTunes, etc.), there must be a security hole somewhere.</p>

<p>We won’t have to pay for the charges, of course, but this is getting annoying to have to file police reports, get new cards, etc. Word to the wise: watch your credit card transactions on your bank statements.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>At a rally in Florida, “Palin incited the crowd”:http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/10/06/in_fla_palin_goes_for_the_roug.html to murder Obama:</p>

<p>bq. “Kill him!” proposed one man in the audience.</p>

<p>I’d like to make a joke at the expense of Republicans and their idiot lemmings but I’m one of those crazy liberals who thinks murder, including encouraging it, is wrong and it’s sad that this behavior continues in America in 2008. I’m not surprised, though. I grew up in Virginia and this is typical of what I’ve seen of Republicans all my life. To me, the Republican Party has always represented bigotry, hatred and ignorance. Sure, there are some rational, educated and non-racist Republicans – I’ve met some of them. But this anger and hatred is still alive and well inside the Republican party and Palin is rilin’ it up.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> There’s <a href="http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2008/10/secret-service-looking-into-potential-threat-on-obama.php">a report</a> that the Secret Service is investigating this threat. How about asking Palin to stop hate-speech like calling Obama a terrorist? When your followers are rabid neanderthals who never learned to think for themselves, you never know what they’ll do.</p>

              <p>For the first time in a long time, we had a date tonight. We went to “Spring Hill”:http://www.springhillnorthwest.com/ in West Seattle for dinner, a place we’ve been trying to get to for months, and we were rewarded with a great dinner. I can’t remember the last time we had this good a dinner. They make a Maker’s Mark cocktail called “Gold ‘N Brown”, which is Maker’s Mark with ginger beer and charred cedar bitters – essentially a Manhattan with ginger beer instead of vermouth. I can’t say that I liked it, however. I felt I had to try it, but I’m not a fan of ginger, especially ginger beer.</p>

<p>We had raw oysters and the “beef steak hot &amp; cold” for appetizers, which was steak tartare (very good) and a small piece of ribeye steak with potato cracklings. For dinner, I had the duck breast, which came thinly-sliced and perfectly-cooked. It came with a fresh cabbage sausage and sat on a quinoa waffle, which tasted like an ordinary Belgian waffle, and mushrooms. Gay had the trout, the best fish I’ve ever had that wasn’t salmon.</p>

<p>On the way home we stopped at Metropolitan Market and picked up some gourmet goodies, like Hempler’s pepper bacon from the deli, some bratwursts, prosciutto and sandwich meat, cheese, wine and some beers I can’t get on Vashon like Fuller’s ESB, a “Full Sail’s 21st anniversary Doppelbock”:http://www.fsb21.com/ and this year’s “Jubelale”:http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/BrewPub/OnTap/5811.aspx, which is one of the best winter treats in the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>We got home at 9:45pm, which is late for us and we stayed up until midnight so we could see OJ Simpson be handcuffed and escorted to prison. It’s poetic that he was convicted 13 years to the day after his acquittal and will finally face prison for a far-lesser crime thanks to far-greater carelessness (both the crime and his defense). There are few events for which I can say “I remember where I was when…”. His acquittal was one of them and I was not happy then so I enjoyed this verdict.</p>
