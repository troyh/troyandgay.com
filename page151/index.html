          </h3>
            <p>In other news, Ouzo has a serious condition. For the last week or two he hadn’t been eating or would only eat a little of his food. He’s done this before over the years and we’d give him some wet food or put something more tasty on his food and a couple days later he’d be fine again. But that didn’t work this time. The night we were leaving for the hospital to deliver Hudson, Kelly noticed that he had a “growth” underneath his chin that we hadn’t noticed before.</p>

<p>Kelly took him to the vet the next morning and they decided they couldn’t figure out what it was. They took an X-ray and discovered a lot of fluid in his chest cavity. This was beyond their skills and referred us to a specialist in Seattle. Kelly then took him to <em>that</em> vet. We still haven’t heard anything from the vet.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> We talked to the vet tonight and it doesn’t look good. He has a tumor at the base of his heart and it’s inoperable. They can’t do a biopsy on it because it’s on his heart. So they’re going to do an ultrasound on Wednesday to see if there are any more tumors in his abdomen which, ironically, would be good because they could then do biopsies on those to determine if it is cancer and what kind of cancer it is. If it’s a cancer that responds to chemotherapy, we can try chemotherapy to see if that helps the tumor on his heart.</p>

            <p>I’m glad Hudson was born 5 minutes after midnight because August 25th is a much cooler date for birthdays than August 24th. Hudson shares a birthday with conductor Leonard Bernstein, movie director Tim Burton, Sean Connery, Elvis Costello, Frederick Forsyth, Rob Halford (singer for Judas Priest, a favorite band of mine as a kid), Monty Hall, football player Marvin Harrison, Stuart Murdoch (founder and singer of Belle &amp; Sebastian, a favorite band of mine as an adult), Regis Philbin, Rachael Ray, Claudia Schiffer, Gene Simmons, fellow Seattleite Tom Skerritt, and Wilco singer Jeff Tweedy. Even a movie director with the same name and initials: “Hugh Hudson”:http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0399853/.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>The labor progressed very fast. At 10pm, the doctor predicted he’d be born by 2am, which we thought was quick and too optimistic – doctors are always optimistic. We were expecting to still be waiting at 6am! But by 11:50pm, less than 2 hours into labor, the nurse called the doctor for the delivery. What?!? The doc got everything ready and by midnight, Gay was doing the breathe and push exercise. That lasted for five minutes at most and the baby was out. From my perspective, Gay seemed to be in more pain than she was with Havana, maybe because her body really wanted him out quick, so it was good that it was so short. Granted, the mother does all the hard stuff, but it’s hard to sit there and watch your wife go through so much pain and you can’t do anything about it (and trust me, nobody involved wants the father to do anything about it).</p>

<p>I cut the umbilical cord, something I foolishly passed on with Havana’s birth. I didn’t think much of it with Havana and I don’t think Gay wanted me to last time, but I’m glad I did it this time just for the experience and to participate in the process. It’s like cutting a firm piece of pasta.</p>

<p>Gay asked for him to be put right on her stomach afterwards, which she didn’t want the first time. I’m not sure what’s better… he was dark grey when for the first minute or so, then he transitioned to a dark purple. Hudson was pretty ugly, not nearly as cute as I thought Havana was when I first saw her. The second birth isn’t quite the shock as the first one, but when a human being suddenly appears in a room without entering through the door, it feels like a magic trick just happened.</p>

<p>After two more hours in the delivery room for some poking and prodding of Hudson by the nurses, we moved to the post-partum room. I chilled our bottle of champagne, the same one we had for Havana’s birth, and had a couple glasses of that until we could get some sleep at 5 or 6am. I got maybe two hours of sleep, Gay got less, before the next round of checkups, tests, shots by the nurses which continued throughout the day.</p>

<p>After dropping Ouzo off at a specialist vet in north Seattle for a diagnosis (more on that later), Kelly brought Havana to the hospital to meet Hudson.</p>

<p>She petted him the way she pets the dogs and stared at him a bit, but was mostly indifferent to him. She can almost say his name, though: “uddsu”.</p>

<p>Incidentally, after Havana’s birth last year, I spent the day watching the construction of the building next door. That building is finished now. It’s the “Swedish Orthopedic Institute”:http://www.swedish.org/body.cfm?id=23. Whenever we drive by it, I can tell Havana that it’s the same age as her (and she won’t care).</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Gay was tired of being pregnant and the waiting list for an induction was so long that we decided to go into Seattle to take Gay’s mind off it. We all went to the RV show at Qwest Field and while there, the OB/GYN called and said that we were next on the list to be induced and that we <em>may</em> get a call tonight or early tomorrow. The RV show was boring so we left and went to Elysian Fields, just down the block for an early dinner and hoping that the hospital would call. We had even packed the car with everything we needed to take to the hospital, just in case.</p>

<p>We’d never been to Elysian Fields and it’s a cool space, and much larger than the original Elysian. There was a large party nearby, seemingly to celebrate a newborn baby (3 months?), that Havana was fascinated with:</p>

<p>Little did she know her baby brother was soon to arrive.</p>

<p>I had a schooner of the Imperial IPA which was very good. It’s been a while since I’ve had a good Imperial IPA at a brewpub, probably since “we went to Steelhead in Eugene”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/08/seattle-to-eugene-or/.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2796679551/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3239/2796679551_785406b18e.jpg" alt="Elysian Fields Imperial IPA" /></a></p>

<p>I had the Kobe beef burger with bleu cheese and finished it off with a schooner of their Dragonstooth Stout. They make a very good stout and I’ve loved it ever since moving to Seattle; it’s right up there with Old Rasputin (but not quite <em>that</em> good).</p>

<p>It would have been very convenient if the hospital had called since we were minutes away, but they didn’t. So we went home. At 8pm, an hour-and-half after we got home, the OB/GYN called and said we could come in. We called Kelly to come over to watch Havana. Bam, she was at the house 10 minutes later and we jumped on the 8:50pm ferry.</p>

<p>We checked into the hospital at 9:30pm and the OB/GYN broke Gay’s water at 10pm. It was all very smooth and quick from there…</p>

            <p>Hudson Ale Hakala was born August 25th at 12:05am. He weighs 8 lbs 8 ounces, is 19 inches long (tall) and is perfectly healthy.</p>

<p>Labor was amazingly short, just 2 hours! He’s sleeping while mom and dad are drinking champagne at 4am.</p>
