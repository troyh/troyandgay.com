            <p>“Julia Child dies at 91”:http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/13/dining/13CND-CHILD.html, apparently of kidney failure. The introduction to her 7th book: “Dining with one’s friends and beloved family is certainly one of life’s primal and most innocent delights, one that is both soul-satisfying and eternal.”</p>

<p>They’ve organized a “Cook-A-Thon as a tribute”:http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?p=1176046 to Julia.</p>

            <p>“The Pixies”:http://www.4ad.com/artists/catalogue/pixies/ are still innovative. “Ignoring the music biz”:http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=P5353_0_6_0_C. And <em>Bam Thwok</em> is as good as anything they’ve ever done. FWIW, I also loved “Frank Black’s”:http://www.frankblack.net/ first two albums, <em>Frank Black</em> and <em>The Teenager of the Year</em>. Loved ‘em, just loved ‘em.</p>

            <p>The internet “continues to rise in importance to Americans”:http://news.com.com/Study%3A+Offline+still+beats+online+for+some+activities/2100-1025_3-5307538.html?part=rss&amp;tag=5307538&amp;subj=news.1025.5. 88% say it plays a role in their daily lives, 30% say it plays a “major role”. But what are people looking for online? News? Music? Porn? Recipes? Nope. They want driving directions. :(  Weird, I think I’ve used the internet for driving directions 4 or 5 times in 8 years.</p>

<p>But really, why are we listening to polls to find out what people do on the internet? Can’t computers tell us what people do online?? And would anyone even answer “Porn” when asked what they use the internet for?</p>
