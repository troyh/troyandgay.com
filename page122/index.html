        <article>
          <p>For Valentine’s Day dinner we pulled out a bottle of wine that we got in October 2007 during our visit to Portland’s wine country. This was a 2005 Black Cap pinot noir.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3287594131/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3199/3287594131_158cf7178e.jpg" alt="BlackCap Pinot Noir" /></a></p>

<p>Black Cap is the wine made by the son of the founder of “Eyrie Vineyards”:http://www.eyrievineyards.com/journal/, Oregon’s first vineyard and essentially the pioneer of pinot noir in Oregon. “He died a few months ago”:http://www.oregonlive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/10/pioneering_winemaker_eyrie_fou.html, unfortunately.  If I recall the story we were told correctly, Jason’s dad wouldn’t give him the job of winemaker at Eyrie so he made his own wine to prove that he could do it. Today, he is the winemaker at Eyrie, so I guess it worked. :)  “Here’s an article”:http://www.avalonwine.com/Black-Cap-Wine.php on Black Cap and Jason.</p>

<p>Anyway, it was a very good bottle. We generally don’t spend much on wine since I (we) don’t really notice much difference in wines once you get above $15-20/bottle, but on special occasions when we do have a good bottle we appreciate them more.</p>

          <p>The other beer I had this weekend was Deschutes’ Hop Henge. I haven’t read anything about this beer yet, but it tastes like a Double IPA that was also dry-hopped. The aroma is wonderful and it’s got a nice bitter bite with a soft lingering bitter aftertaste. Another great great beer from Deschutes.</p>

        <article>
          <p>I finally had my first World Wide Stout. This beer is unbelievable. The label reads “A very dark beer brewed with a ridiculous amount of barley”. It takes six months to age too. It’s an 18% ABV beer, which makes it 30% more alcohol than wine and even more potent than the 14% “Raison D’Extra”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/24/dogfish-head-raison-dextra/, but less than their “120 Minute IPA”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/06/08/dogfish-head-120-minute-ipa/. So one bottle is like drinking 3 glasses of wine. It’s almost irresponsible to call this a beer. Plus, it tastes more like a port than a beer. I shared it with Gay and we drank it out of wine glasses. It took me an hour to drink my half!</p>

<p>I haven’t had a beer like this since Sam Adams Triple Bock back in early 1990s. It’s a great beer for sipping, and I loved every sip of it.</p>

<p>I’m either in love with Dogfish Head or they put something else in the beer… last night I dreamt that I visited the Dogfish Head brewery.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>For anyone Googling for a similar problem they’re having with DirecTV…</p>

<p>We have two DirecTV receivers and on one of them we were having a lot of pixelation, i.e., digital artifacts, on HD channels. It would get so bad it was unwatchable. This happened for months. I called DirecTV and they always shipped me a new receiver and it always solved the problem for a while. But the problem always returned eventually.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>It’s relatively easy to get a new receiver, DirecTV ships you a new one,  you replace your old with the new and put the old one in the same box and slap the FedEx sticker they provide on it and back it goes. But, to their credit, DirecTV wanted to get to the bottom of the problem so I was elevated to “Home Response Service” or somesuch name. This means I get better service, they come to your house quickly and the customer service repeatedly call you to make sure you’re happy.</p>

<p>Long story short, after an inability to solve the problem, the last DirecTV tech that came out decided to replace the “B-Band converters”:http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/global/contentPageNR.jsp?assetId=P4370042. Neither of us that it’d fix it but he had nothing else to try. It turns out that one of them rattled when you shook it, as if the electronics inside had become unglued. Since replacing them, the picture has been perfect!</p>

<p>The converters just hang off the back of the receiver in between it and the coax cable. My theory is that the electronics in the B-Band converter would sometimes sit right in the box and the picture would be okay, but if they were jiggled enough they’d get dislodged and the problem would come back. Usually when I replaced the receiver, the converter happened to sit right and eventually they’d get bumped and the problem would come back.</p>

<p>Fortunately, DirecTV’s newest HD DVR, the HR-23, has these converters built-in so this problem will disappear for DirecTV eventually. But those of us with the HR-22 or older receivers who have to use the extra converters will potentially have this problem.</p>

          <p>We ate well during the Super Bowl. Megan made 7-layer dip, a really good guacamole (nicely salty) and veggies and dip. Gay made “Primanti Bros”:http://www.primantibros.com/ sandwiches and cup cakes that we both decorated. Coincidentally, Megan had the same cupcake idea and she made similar cupcakes with the Steelers emblem on them.</p>

<p>The beers we had were “Full Sail Amber”:http://www.fullsailbrewing.com/amber.cfm that Jon &amp; Megan brought over and we had Sierra Nevadaa’s “Torpedo Extra IPA”:http://www.sierranevada.com/beers/torpedo.html (a double IPA which was new to me), Pike Pale (a low-alcohol beer well-suited for football games) and “Lagunitas IPA”:http://www.lagunitas.com/beers/ipa.html, but that was intended to be “Lagunitas Pils”:http://www.lagunitas.com/beers/pilsner.html. After the game we popped a bottle of “Schramsberg”:http://www.schramsberg.com/ champagne to toast the Steelers. Surprisingly, I was not hung-over in the morning. although that game was worth having a hang-over for.</p>
