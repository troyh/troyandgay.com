          </h3>
            <p>We got room service breakfast at the hotel in Portland, packed up and were checked out and in the car by 9:30am. Not bad. We hoped to get to Redding, California by 4pm. That was too optimistic. Traffic was light but 7 hours in car seats makes kids unhappy. Hudson was less happy, since he hates being in a wet diaper for more than a few minutes so we had to stop quicklyt at rest stops and Gay rode half the way in the back seat sandwiched between the car seats trying to entertain them.</p>

<p>We stopped in Roseburg, Oregon for lunch at Subway, a little play time at a park in the town, a bathroom break at the local YMCA and got gas and coffee on our way out of town.</p>

<p>Havana complained very little on the long day. She once announced that she had to go potty while we were in Northern California. I checked the nav system and found a rest stop 18 miles away. We didn’t think she’d make it so we told her that it was okay to go potty in her diaper. She kept quiet for the next 15 minutes when we got to rest stop in Weed, California and she had held it the entire time and went both #1 and #2 at the rest stop. She’s a little trooper.</p>

<p>I love the drive between southern Oregon and Redding, CA. The scenery is beautiful through very Pacific Northwest scenery and once you get to Mt. Shasta and into the mountains the road is gently winding with great vistas everywhere you look. We also saw all forms of weather. It was mostly rain, and sometimes very driving rain, but we also saw sun and snow with icy roads for a short stretch.</p>

<p>We got to the hotel at 6pm all very tired. We checked in and immediately ordered pizza delivery. We ate pizza and Gay and I drank the two “Laughing Dog”:http://www.laughingdogbrewing.com/Brew_News.html beers we got in Portland,  Alpha Dog Imperial IPA and then the Dogfather Imperial Stout. Nothing beats a nice hoppy beer when you’re tired so the Alpha Dog was perfect. Everyone else went to bed by 8pm while I had the last glass of the Dogfather Imperial Stout while reading a couple chapters of “Outliers”:http://www.gladwell.com/outliers/index.html.</p>

<p>We planned to have a shorter day of driving the next day into San Francisco, a drive that should take 3 hours broken up with a stop at the “Sierra Nevada Brewery”:http://www.sierranevada.com/tour/introduction.html in Chico, California.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>On our way to San Francisco, we left home at noon and got to “our hotel”:http://www.governorhotel.com/ in Portland at 4pm. We checked into our room, relaxed a bit after the drive and to let Havana and Hudson get some away from sitting time and went out to eat at the recently-opened “Deschutes Public House”:http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/brewery/brew-pubs/portland-pub/default.aspx a few blocks away. This was the first real walk we’ve taken with “our new two-kid stroller”:http://www.philandteds.com/dash_index.htm.</p>

<p>The Deschutes pub was a great start to the trip. The place is very cool inside, a big open space with big timbers holding the ceiling up. We were seated at a huge table, big enough for 6. I ordered a “Hop Henge IPA”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/02/09/deschutes-hop-henge-experimental-ipa/ and Gay got an amazing stout, Nitro Night Rider Stout, which was their very good Obsidian Stout brewed with coffee and served from a nitro tap. If there ever was a beer you could have for breakfast, this was it. It smelled and tasted so much like coffee you’d think you were drinking a carbonated coffee with a creamy froth on top. I wish they bottled the stuff! The food hit the spot too. I had a bacon bleu cheese burger, which is hard to not make delicious, and Gay had the Reuben. Havana had grilled cheese and fries and Hudson missed out and had to eat his baby mush.</p>

<p>After dinner we took the long way back to the hotel and stopped at the Whole Foods. Wow, what a beer selection! We kept finding more beers that you can’t get in Seattle and ended up with $50 worth of beers including Dogfish Head Chicory Stout, Laughing Dog’s Alpha Dog Imperial IPA, Laughing Dog’s Dogfather Imperial Stout, Black Orchard from The Bruery, Alameda XX Stout and Goose Island Kentucky Bourbon County Stout. We had a nice chat about beer with the beer guy at Whole Foods who, coincidentally grew up in Oakton, Virginia, just minutes from where I grew up.</p>

<p>We went straight back to the hotel to put the kids to bed because we knew we’d have a long day of driving on Saturday.</p>

            <p>Seven days (five business days) “after I applied”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/03/12/apples-iphone-developer-approval-process/ to be in the iPhone Developer Program, I was accepted. Apple then let me pay them $99 so that I could get a key and install my app on my iPhone. It’s so nice of them to allow me to make software for their platform. Then I had to go through the involved process of making my security key, uploading it to Apple, getting a certificate from them and installing it on my computer and then registering it with Xcode.</p>

<p>I’ve built software on DOS, several flavors of Windows, Windows mobile devices, Palm devices, a few flavors of commercial Unixes and even Apple’s OS X. I have never had to be <em>approved</em> to be a developer on those platforms. I still don’t understand why Apple is so protective of the iPhone and why it makes sense to them to erect barriers to developers wanting to build iPhone apps. I can’t imagine the hoops I’ll have to jump through or how long it’ll be if/when I want to put the app in the App Store.</p>

            <a class="post-link" href="/2009/03/14/dizzy-illy.html">Dizzy Illy</a>
          </h3>
            <p>On Wednesday morning, Illy was slow to eat her breakfast. That’s odd for Illy, she’ll knock small children over to get to food. Then I let her out to go to the bathroom and she had trouble walking a straight line. She refused to come back inside and slowly walked around the yard. We didn’t think much of it until noon when she hadn’t come back in. We found her laying behind a row of <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=hydrangeas&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=fv27SebOHoKEsAOSwKQ2&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=title">hydrangeas</a> and she refused to get up. We eventually coaxed her up and she couldn’t walk without falling down, so I carried her inside and up to her bed to rest. She made her way out into the hallway but couldn’t go any further so she just layed down for hours.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>At this point, we figured she had hurt her hips as older Labradors tend to do. She’s had both knees replaced, another common problem with her breed, so we knew her knees weren’t the problem. She’s fell down before and had similar, although less severe, symptoms and she always recovered. The problem with dogs is that they just don’t tell you what’s bothering them. She wouldn’t eat or drink water. She wouldn’t even eat her favorite treat, which has never happened with Illy.</p>

<p>By Thursday she was worse, she couldn’t walk or stand at all and I had to carry her outside to go to the bathroom. It didn’t make sense that she’d get worse over time, so we called the vet Friday morning. They said that it sounds like she has “sudden dizziness” and that it’s very common among older dogs of all breeds. I’d never heard of such a thing. The vet said that it just goes away after a few days. Sure enough, by Friday evening she was getting better. She still couldn’t walk a straight line very well and she’s slow but she didn’t need to be carried around anymore.</p>

<p>This morning, she could stand up on her own and walk outside, go to the bathroom and come back in all by herself. She’s still slightly wobbly and very tentative about walking. Hopefully, by tomorrow she’ll continue to improve.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>I’m building an iPhone app and wanted to put it on my iPhone to try it out on real hardware. I discovered that I can’t do this without getting a license from Apple which requires that you log into your Developer account at Apple.com, which I found shocking. You then have to fill out a form and promise to pay $99. Okay, not a big deal and $99 isn’t much. But then you have to be approved for the program. I assume that means they reject people. <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2008/03/14/iphone-developer-rejection-letter-mass-mailing/">They reject people</a> from building apps for their platform?! I’ve never heard of such a thing!</p>

<p>I can understand their approval process for selling your app on their App Store, but they won’t even let me make a crappy app and put it on my own iPhone. And you can’t just pay the $99 and get your license immediately. Again, this doesn’t mean they have to accept my app on their store and potentially ruin other people’s iPhones, this is just so I can put my app <em>on my own</em> iPhone!</p>

<p>It gets worse….</p>

<p>Then 24 hours later, I got this email from Apple:</p>

<p>What?! They really do look over my application and need to verify that I have a real company. Why? Again, this is just so I can try my own app out on my own phone.  Moreover, I’m planning to give this app away for free. Why do I have to have a corporation to do that? What good is this doing Apple? Who are they protecting themselves from?</p>

<p>What do they think I’m going to do? Build an app and to distribute it outside of the App Store, invite people over to my house so they can put their phone in my cradle and sync the app to it? Or I’d post my license key on a web site along with my source code so that people could download XCode and my source and then build and sync the app to their iPhone? And I’d do this to avoid paying Apple $0 for the App Store fee on my free app?</p>

<p>It’s even more crazy given that I can build a Mac OS X app and distribute it myself without Apple’s consent and I can charge $1000 for it if I want and Apple gets none of that money. But giving away a free app, or even selling it for $1 on the App Store, and Apple needs a thorough vetting process?!?</p>

<p>To make it even dumber, they require a fax. A fax! In 2009! Apple Computer requires a faxed document in 2009. The Washington State government deals in electronic documents and our lawyers deal in electronic documents. State government and lawyers have embraced PDFs but Apple, one of the biggest supporters of PDFs, isn’t quite sure about email and PDFs so they need a 1970s technology to deliver documents. Unbelievable. Now I’ve gotta go figure out how to fax my documentation to Apple rather than just email the PDFs to them.</p>

<p>Even after I do all this, I still have to wait. I have to wait to be given the chance to pay my $99 and then, apparently, I have to wait for them to issue me a license that I can use to transfer my app to my iPhone. <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=8658270">According to some</a>, this can take weeks and even months!</p>

<p>Whomever is in charge of the iPhone Developer Program at Apple should be fired.</p>

<p>Update: I figured there has to be a way to email the documentation to them so I called Apple to ask. Nope. Fax is the only way they will accept documents. I asked if I could FedEx the documentation to them and the person I talked to said no, only fax is acceptable. I asked why and they said that it’s because of “legal reasons”. In other words, a dumbass lawyer at Apple who doesn’t know what a PDF is and hasn’t used email in their life said fax is the only acceptable format (to their credit, Apple probably ditched telegrams a few years ago) and nobody at Apple questioned it. I imagine that lawyer then put his spectacles in his pocket and his fedora on his head, put the dust cover back on his typewriter, grabbed his briefcase, hopped into his Model T and drove home.</p>

<p>Update #2: The iPhone Developer Program customer service I talked to earlier called me back. Gotta give them credit for that. And they said that there is a postal address that I can send my documentation to. That makes sense, but I still don’t understand why a fax is preferable to email. Faxes are very low quality copies of a document, a PDF or even a scanned document is a much higher-quality version and even more difficult to fake. Apple seems to think that getting into the iPhone Developer Program is such a sacred thing that they need a big vetting process and be legally protected. It’s paranoid and downright stupid thinking on Apple’s part. They really look like idiots throughout the iPhone Developer Program.</p>
