            <p>We checked out of the hotel in Portland and were on the road home by 10am. We stopped in Dupont, WA for lunch and took the 3pm ferry back to Vashon. A total of 1800 miles of driving, which was 700 less than “last year’s drive to California”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/08/seattle-to-eugene-or/.</p>

            <p>On Tuesday we went to the “Lucky Labrador”:http://www.luckylab.com/html/story.html brewpub, which we’ve never been to before but had heard good things about (and because we love labradors). Havana slept through most of lunch. Lucky Lab has a very aloof group of employees who don’t seem to care if you order anything or not and is even dog-friendly. There are lots of photos and painting of labradors, all looked just like Illy and Ouzo.</p>

<p>We then stopped at “John’s Marketplace”:http://www.johnsmarketplace.com/. I’d heard about this place from “a Seattle beer blogger”:http://seattlebeernews.com/?p=96 and he’s right, I’ve never seen a bigger or better beer selection.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3407017059/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3349/3407017059_bed89ddd67.jpg" alt="John's Marketplace" /></a></p>

<p>We found tons of beers we’ve never heard of and many that we have heard of but can’t get in Seattle. Minutes after we got there and I was looking at the beers in the first aisle I heard a loud pop and an immediate announcement on the PA: “Broken bottle on aisle one!” Hudson had pulled a bottle off the shelf and, unfazed, was reaching for another. They were very nice about it and didn’t charge us for it. We left with 29 bottles, mostly 650ml, of beers to take home.</p>

<p>We walked around the little area there called “Multnomah Village”:http://www.multnomahvillage.org/joomla/ and found a kid’s toy shop (on Troy Street!) where Havana immediately found “choo choos” (a wooden train set) and played with that while Gay found a couple toys for her. Then we found a kids clothes shop and Gay got her a new shirt. We left that area and drove around the outskirts of Portland before going back to the hotel for dinner at the rooftop restaurant “Departure”:http://www.starwoodhotels.com/luxury/property/dining/index.html?propertyID=1757.</p>

<p>Dinner was stressful with the kids. We didn’t get there until after 6:30pm and they weren’t in the mood to sit still. Fortunately, they stuck us in a corner and the place was pretty loud so they weren’t disruptive to anyone but us. I ate most of my dinner with Havana on my lap and Gay was entertaining Hudson on the bench seat. The food was very good, though.</p>

            <p>“Obama fired GM CEO Wagoner”:http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2009/03/29/obama-to-gm-ceo-wagoner-youre-fired/! To all those who defend Wagoner as a great CEO… I am sure I could take the #1 car-maker in the world, lose two-thirds of my marketshare in a few years, lose money on every single car I make, invest in things that people have said for decades they don’t want and drive the company into bankruptcy. That must make me a great CEO too, so if you were happy with Wagoner, please hire me and pay me millions a year to do it to your company. And if I can’t kill your company faster than Wagoner killed GM, I will only take half the $20 million bonus GM is paying him to leave.</p>

<p>To all those who think the federal government shouldn’t be running GM, I agree that would be bad. It’s so bad that the only thing worse than the Federal Government running GM is GM running GM.</p>

<p>Obama quickly realized Rick Wagoner is a loser as a CEO. And he knows that Chrysler is worthless so he’s forcing them to either merge with Fiat or go out of business. I’d still prefer that both companies be left to die, but given that Obama wants to at least help GM survive, this is the best/smartest thing he could do. Hopefully, GM will go through bankruptcy, get rid of the unions and come out stronger. But I doubt it and it will likely be a waste of tax dollars to try. Let’s hope I’m wrong.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of hand-wringing about the poor union employees who will lose their jobs if GM goes away. But they only have themselves to blame. They strike for contract negotiations, higher salaries, better benefits, etc. every few years but they’ve never once had a strike to protest GM’s bungling management and their designing cars that suck. Had they stood up and refused to build gas-guzzling Hummers when Wagoner bought the company or had they stood up and demanded that Wagoner not kill off the wildly-popular electric car, the EV-1, and been ahead of the game, they’d all have safe jobs.</p>

            <p>We drove to Portland to “The Nines”:http://www.starwoodhotels.com/luxury/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=1757 hotel to stay there for a couple nights.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3405767550/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3563/3405767550_a7e098ca98.jpg" alt="Downtown Portland" /></a></p>

<p>The Nines is a new Portland luxury hotel but they’re suffering so Gay got a good deal on a suite (there’s positives to economic downturns!), which is the only type of room to stay in with kids who go to bed at 7pm.</p>

<p>Our room wasn’t ready when we got there so the hotel sent us to the bar to wait with free cocktails. After moving into the room, we went back to the Deschutes Public House for dinner, which is a very comfortable place to take tired kids.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We left Sunday morning for a long drive up to Ashland, Oregon. I was expecting to arrive in Ashland, eat dinner at a Subway or something and go to bed early in a lousy hotel. The lousy hotel was right, but we discovered that Ashland has a nice little brewpub, “The Standing Stone Brewing Co”:http://www.standingstonebrewing.com/. This was a nice place to go after a long day of driving, but Hudson was very tired and cranky, which is unusual for him. That made dinner less fun. Of the sample set of beers, we both liked the Belgian Saison and I liked the Double IPA.</p>
