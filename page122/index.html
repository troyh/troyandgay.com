            <p>Today’s Gay’s birthday. Happy Birthday, Gay!</p>

<p>We had breakfast at the hotel in Redding and took our time leaving thinking we had plenty of time. We gave the kids a bath in the morning after breakfast, packed up and got on the road by 11am. We made our way pretty quickly to Chico to the Sierra Nevada Brewery.</p>

<p>The “tour” is a self-guided tour, if you can call it that. We just walked around the brewery. Since it’s Sunday, no one was working so it was quiet. They have a brewpub in the brewery so we went there for lunch. It’s a fairly typical brewpub, and a very popular place in the area. There were lots of locals and a surprising number of people drinking wine. I ordered the Torpedo IPA, a new (to me, at least) Sierra Nevada beer that I really like. It was every bit as good on draft. They have a lot of beers that are only available at the brewery or in local pubs so we also ordered their sampler. Their sampler consists of 16 beers! I’ve never had a sample size that big. I liked the Bigfoot, the Chico IPA and, of course, the Porter and Stout. A surprise was that we liked their Hefeweizen, called “Ruthless Hefeweizen”. I really don’t like wheat beers at all but this was pretty good. Gay liked it even more than me. Another surprise was their new “Pale Bock” which is neither a pale ale or a bock, but a malt liquor. I expected to really dislike it and, while I didn’t like it all that much, it wasn’t so bad. It’s far from an Olde English or Colt 45, though and was not even served in a paper bag.</p>

<p>We headed away from the brewery at 1pm hoping to be in San Francisco within 3 hours. But we hit traffic in Vacaville and it was slow traffic for most of the way to San Francisco. We got to our place in the city at 6pm. We had no food and we were hungry so we put the kids in the stroller looking for some quick take-out so we could get the kids to bed soon after 7pm. No luck. We ended up getting prepared sandwiches at a deli which were not good. Gay got online and found a Thai place that also has sushi place and that delivers so we ordered some sushi and, to hedge our bets, some Pad Thai. We finally got Havana to bed by 8:30pm, the food arrived but we were disappointed in that.</p>

<p>We were tired and went to bed by 10pm.</p>

            <p>We got room service breakfast at the hotel in Portland, packed up and were checked out and in the car by 9:30am. Not bad. We hoped to get to Redding, California by 4pm. That was too optimistic. Traffic was light but 7 hours in car seats makes kids unhappy. Hudson was less happy, since he hates being in a wet diaper for more than a few minutes so we had to stop quicklyt at rest stops and Gay rode half the way in the back seat sandwiched between the car seats trying to entertain them.</p>

<p>We stopped in Roseburg, Oregon for lunch at Subway, a little play time at a park in the town, a bathroom break at the local YMCA and got gas and coffee on our way out of town.</p>

<p>Havana complained very little on the long day. She once announced that she had to go potty while we were in Northern California. I checked the nav system and found a rest stop 18 miles away. We didn’t think she’d make it so we told her that it was okay to go potty in her diaper. She kept quiet for the next 15 minutes when we got to rest stop in Weed, California and she had held it the entire time and went both #1 and #2 at the rest stop. She’s a little trooper.</p>

<p>I love the drive between southern Oregon and Redding, CA. The scenery is beautiful through very Pacific Northwest scenery and once you get to Mt. Shasta and into the mountains the road is gently winding with great vistas everywhere you look. We also saw all forms of weather. It was mostly rain, and sometimes very driving rain, but we also saw sun and snow with icy roads for a short stretch.</p>

<p>We got to the hotel at 6pm all very tired. We checked in and immediately ordered pizza delivery. We ate pizza and Gay and I drank the two “Laughing Dog”:http://www.laughingdogbrewing.com/Brew_News.html beers we got in Portland,  Alpha Dog Imperial IPA and then the Dogfather Imperial Stout. Nothing beats a nice hoppy beer when you’re tired so the Alpha Dog was perfect. Everyone else went to bed by 8pm while I had the last glass of the Dogfather Imperial Stout while reading a couple chapters of “Outliers”:http://www.gladwell.com/outliers/index.html.</p>

<p>We planned to have a shorter day of driving the next day into San Francisco, a drive that should take 3 hours broken up with a stop at the “Sierra Nevada Brewery”:http://www.sierranevada.com/tour/introduction.html in Chico, California.</p>

            <p>On our way to San Francisco, we left home at noon and got to “our hotel”:http://www.governorhotel.com/ in Portland at 4pm. We checked into our room, relaxed a bit after the drive and to let Havana and Hudson get some away from sitting time and went out to eat at the recently-opened “Deschutes Public House”:http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/brewery/brew-pubs/portland-pub/default.aspx a few blocks away. This was the first real walk we’ve taken with “our new two-kid stroller”:http://www.philandteds.com/dash_index.htm.</p>

<p>The Deschutes pub was a great start to the trip. The place is very cool inside, a big open space with big timbers holding the ceiling up. We were seated at a huge table, big enough for 6. I ordered a “Hop Henge IPA”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/02/09/deschutes-hop-henge-experimental-ipa/ and Gay got an amazing stout, Nitro Night Rider Stout, which was their very good Obsidian Stout brewed with coffee and served from a nitro tap. If there ever was a beer you could have for breakfast, this was it. It smelled and tasted so much like coffee you’d think you were drinking a carbonated coffee with a creamy froth on top. I wish they bottled the stuff! The food hit the spot too. I had a bacon bleu cheese burger, which is hard to not make delicious, and Gay had the Reuben. Havana had grilled cheese and fries and Hudson missed out and had to eat his baby mush.</p>

<p>After dinner we took the long way back to the hotel and stopped at the Whole Foods. Wow, what a beer selection! We kept finding more beers that you can’t get in Seattle and ended up with $50 worth of beers including Dogfish Head Chicory Stout, Laughing Dog’s Alpha Dog Imperial IPA, Laughing Dog’s Dogfather Imperial Stout, Black Orchard from The Bruery, Alameda XX Stout and Goose Island Kentucky Bourbon County Stout. We had a nice chat about beer with the beer guy at Whole Foods who, coincidentally grew up in Oakton, Virginia, just minutes from where I grew up.</p>

<p>We went straight back to the hotel to put the kids to bed because we knew we’d have a long day of driving on Saturday.</p>

            <p>Seven days (five business days) “after I applied”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/03/12/apples-iphone-developer-approval-process/ to be in the iPhone Developer Program, I was accepted. Apple then let me pay them $99 so that I could get a key and install my app on my iPhone. It’s so nice of them to allow me to make software for their platform. Then I had to go through the involved process of making my security key, uploading it to Apple, getting a certificate from them and installing it on my computer and then registering it with Xcode.</p>

<p>I’ve built software on DOS, several flavors of Windows, Windows mobile devices, Palm devices, a few flavors of commercial Unixes and even Apple’s OS X. I have never had to be <em>approved</em> to be a developer on those platforms. I still don’t understand why Apple is so protective of the iPhone and why it makes sense to them to erect barriers to developers wanting to build iPhone apps. I can’t imagine the hoops I’ll have to jump through or how long it’ll be if/when I want to put the app in the App Store.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>On Wednesday morning, Illy was slow to eat her breakfast. That’s odd for Illy, she’ll knock small children over to get to food. Then I let her out to go to the bathroom and she had trouble walking a straight line. She refused to come back inside and slowly walked around the yard. We didn’t think much of it until noon when she hadn’t come back in. We found her laying behind a row of <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=hydrangeas&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=fv27SebOHoKEsAOSwKQ2&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=title">hydrangeas</a> and she refused to get up. We eventually coaxed her up and she couldn’t walk without falling down, so I carried her inside and up to her bed to rest. She made her way out into the hallway but couldn’t go any further so she just layed down for hours.</p>

<p>At this point, we figured she had hurt her hips as older Labradors tend to do. She’s had both knees replaced, another common problem with her breed, so we knew her knees weren’t the problem. She’s fell down before and had similar, although less severe, symptoms and she always recovered. The problem with dogs is that they just don’t tell you what’s bothering them. She wouldn’t eat or drink water. She wouldn’t even eat her favorite treat, which has never happened with Illy.</p>

<p>By Thursday she was worse, she couldn’t walk or stand at all and I had to carry her outside to go to the bathroom. It didn’t make sense that she’d get worse over time, so we called the vet Friday morning. They said that it sounds like she has “sudden dizziness” and that it’s very common among older dogs of all breeds. I’d never heard of such a thing. The vet said that it just goes away after a few days. Sure enough, by Friday evening she was getting better. She still couldn’t walk a straight line very well and she’s slow but she didn’t need to be carried around anymore.</p>

<p>This morning, she could stand up on her own and walk outside, go to the bathroom and come back in all by herself. She’s still slightly wobbly and very tentative about walking. Hopefully, by tomorrow she’ll continue to improve.</p>
