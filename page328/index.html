          <p>We <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=48759">announced</a> that we are hiring our first employee at <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a>! After surviving the dot-com crash and working day &amp; night (&amp; weekends) to build and maintain the site for very little financial reward, it’s gratifying to finally be able to hire someone to handle the day-to-day work it requires. We’re very excited that we will finally be able to focus our attention on the part we’re best at (software) and hand over the reins to someone who is perfectly-qualified to handle the part we’re not good at. Years from now I believe we will look back at this as a pivotal event in our history.</p>

          <p>We haven’t had a power outage in over a year, but last night at 7pm we had one for a little over an hour. When the power came back on, I discovered that the power supply was blown on one of our internal servers. I suspect it was because it was plugged into the <a href="http://www.belkin.com/">Belkin</a> UPS and not the <a href="http://www.apcc.com/index.cfm">APC</a> UPS. I’ll never buy a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply">UPS</a> that isn’t APC again – they’re more expensive but worth it, IMO. The local <a href="http://vashonpc.com">Vashon computer store</a> had a power supply so it’s back up. I love commodity hardware!</p>

          <p>Philip Greenspun <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2003/10/12#a2656">read the book</a> <em>About Schmidt</em>. Weird how the book is so different than the movie (which <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/06/001496.php">I loved</a>).</p>

          <p>I got the new <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/70203/wo/y34BFVlcLQm627Fszln4pV0pbaB/1.3.0.5.10">Apple wireless keyboard</a> last night at the <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/universityvillage/">Apple Store</a>. They were out of the wireless mouse so I have to go back and get that. It’s like magic to use a keyboard with no cable. Sounds trivial, but it’s a pleasure to see my desk without the ugly cables running across it. I feel like I’m living in the 21st century.</p>

<p>The other two great things about this keyboard are that 1) it’s completely open, so dirt can be easily blown out of it and 2) the esc key is twice as wide, which any vi-user will tell you is a blessing.</p>
