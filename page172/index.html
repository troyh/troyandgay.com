          <p>We watched “My Kid Could Paint That”:http://www.netflix.com/Movie/My_Kid_Could_Paint_That/70059388?trkid=226870 last night, a documentary about “Marla Olmstead”:http://www.marlaolmstead.com/, a 4-year-old girl (now 7), who paints abstract art that turns out to be very good. It’s a good documentary but it’s consumed by the argument about whether or not she’s a fraud – some believe her father helps her after “60 Minutes did a story on her”:http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/02/22/60II/main675522.shtml.</p>

<p>You could argue about “what is art”, whether all abstract art is a fraud and what the difference is between being coached by a father or an art teacher. But what I think is interesting about it is that people who think she’s a fraud always complain that her paintings are too pricey. If she was giving them away for free, no one would argue about whether she’s a fraud or not. The people who believe that the price is too high for her paintings are the types of people that believe prices can be set objectively by “price experts” (usually themselves, of course). The beauty of prices in a free market is that they are set by the people in the market (supply and demand), but everyone seems to think that they can determine for everyone what something “should cost”.</p>

<p>No one is wrong about the price of anything because prices are subjective and they are subjective because different people have different needs and wants. $4 for a liter of bottled water seems really expensive to me right now, but if I were dying of thirst in the desert, someone could charge me a lot more than $4 for that same bottle of water and I’d pay it. I happily pay $8 for a 4-pack of my favorite stout beer, most people think that’s overpriced. Lots of people spend $4 for lattes and think that’s a fair price, I think it’s too much. I’m not stupid about beer prices and smart about latte prices, I’m smart about what I like and what I don’t like. So is everyone else.</p>

<p>The only reason prices for things in stores today are the same for everyone is because it’s easier to average out the price than it is to charge each person for how much they value the thing. If you find something in a store that seems like a low price, you buy it. But someone else may think the same price is too high, so they don’t buy it. It all averages out to the price on the sticker. People get fooled by that and assume that prices are set by experts.</p>

<p>Who cares if Marla’s paintings are made by a 4-year-old and who cares if her father coaches her or not? If you like it, it’s valuable, if not, it’s not. If you like it enough, the price is fair.</p>

<p>It’s about as dark as a stout can get with a foamy tan head. It tastes malty, part chocolate, part coffee-flavor with a slight bitterness on the aftertaste. It tastes like a classic oatmeal stout to me. It’s rated a “3.63 on RateBeer”:http://ratebeer.com/beer/anderson-valley-barney-flats-oatmeal-stout/334/ and an “A- on BeerAdvocate”:http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/193/615.</p>

<p>We drove through Anderson Valley on “our way from Mendocino to Napa”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/12/eureka-to-napa-california/ and must’ve driven right by it. I knew this brewery was somewhere in the area when I saw the sign for the Anderson Valley, but we didn’t stop and now I’m regretting it.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Today is Gay’s birthday. We’re going out to dinner tonight (without Havana) in the big city.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> We were reminded of why the “Washington State Ferry System sucks”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/06/washington-state-ferry-system-sucks/. We waited in the ferry line for an hour because the boats were running late, we missed the first ferry and the next ferry was 20 minutes away (at best). We wouldn’t make it to the restaurant until almost 8pm and we’d have to rush through dinner to catch the 10:15pm ferry or risk hitting the 11:40pm ferry. So we decided to have dinner on the island and go into Seattle sometime this week to make it up. This way, Gay gets two birthday dinners. :)</p>

        <article>
          <p>People hear that Exxon/Mobil made “$40 billion in profit”:http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/01/AR2007020100714.html in 2007 and scream “price-gouging”. Of course, price-gouging is impossible because companies don’t control the price of anything in a free market, supply and demand alone controls prices. Don’t believe it? If they do control prices, why is gas only $4/gallon and not $100/gallon? Answer: because they can’t control the price.</p>

<p>Money Magazine “explains”:http://money.cnn.com/2008/03/13/news/economy/gas_gallon/index.htm?eref=rss_topstories the parts of the price of gas. Here’s how gas prices are broken down:</p>

<p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/blog/pix/2008/03/picture-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>68% of the cost goes to the companies, like Exxon/Mobil, that drill for oil and produce crude oil. Oil can be used to produce “many things you probably use daily”:http://www.thegoodhuman.com/2007/05/25/do-you-know-which-products-are-made-out-of-oil/, not just gasoline. Refineries turn crude oil into gasoline and they get 8%. The distribution companies that deliver the gas to your local gas station also get 8%. The government takes 13%, usually for maintenance of roads. The remaining 3% goes to the gas station that sells you the gas.</p>

<p>Exxon’s $40 billion in 2007 is 10% of their “total revenue of $400 billion”:http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3AXOM. That means that Exxon’s <em>profit margin</em> is 10%, which is healthy, but small compared to Microsoft’s “27% profit margin”:http://finance.google.com/finance?q=msft or Google’s “25% profit margin”:http://finance.google.com/finance?q=goog. Before you complain you pay too much for gas, think about how much you overpaid for the computer you’re using to read this.</p>

<p>Using $4/gallon as an example, $2.72 (68%) of that that is paid to Exxon and their profit is 27¢ on each gallon of gas. Even if Exxon decided to make no profit, a gallon of gas would only drop by 27¢. But if that were to happen, Exxon would have to pack up shop unless they could convince their employees to stay given that their salaries will never increase.</p>

<p>Exxon doesn’t care what the price of a gallon of gas is, they only care about their profit. When the price of anything goes down, people buy more of it (and vice versa). Exxon would be just as happy, if not happier, to make 10% profit on revenue of $800 billion than 10% of their current $400 billion. So lower gas prices are in Exxon’s best interest. So you can be sure that Exxon is going to use the $40 billion to find more oil and find more efficient (cheaper) ways to extract it, which will help to lower prices and increase their profits in the future.</p>

<p>Note: What most people don’t realize about gasoline is that once the gas goes into the pipeline, Exxon (and others) are done. The gas is distributed via trucks to local gas stations and they don’t care what gas station they’re selling the gas to – the same truck delivers gas to several local gas stations. If you think you go to an Exxon-branded gas station and buy oil that Exxon extracted from the ground, you’re wrong. That’s why “stupid ideas”:http://www.snopes.com/politics/gasoline/gasout.asp that have circulated on the internet don’t work.</p>
