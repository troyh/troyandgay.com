          <p>Havana took her first two (not one, but two!) steps today. She stood on her own in front of her mom and, after some coaxing, took two baby steps towards me with no help. It was enough to reach my hands and Gay broke down in tears (girls!). We didn’t get a photo or video, unfortunately.</p>

          <p>We’re expecting a baby boy in August. He and Havana will be just 16 months apart in age. We’ve compiled a long list of names, but none so far feel right to us.</p>

<p>Havana already has her t-shirt:</p>

<p>It says “Big Sister”, but she can’t read yet so she doesn’t know yet. She knows she has pink “Chucks”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Taylor_All-Stars though – she’s even pointing them out. :)</p>

          <p>“Deschutes”:http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/default.aspx, one of my favorite breweries, makes an Imperial Stout called “The Abyss”:http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/Brews/Reserve+Series/default.aspx in their “Reserve Series”. It’s brewed with licorice and molasses and is aged in oak <em>bourbon</em> barrels so I was really looking forward to it. I had the 2007 vintage last night:</p>

<p>The bottle is dipped in black wax making it hard to open. The label reads:</p>

<p>bq. It’s dark. It’s deep. It’s mysterious. This imperial stout has the immeasurable depth inviting you to explore and discover its rich complex profile. The flavor of this special brew draws you further and further with each sip. The Abyss beckons. Enjoy the journey.</p>

<p>It’s a heavy beer that smells like a big red wine and tastes slightly sweet, presumably from the molasses, and chocolatey, like a good Imperial stout. There was lots of bitterness, but not as powerful as the 65 IBUs that they say it is. And the aftertaste stays with you for a while, so it took me a good hour-and-a-half to drink it. That’s good, because at 11% alcohol you don’t want to drink it quickly.</p>

<p>It’s rated in the 100th percentile (!) and a “4.17 on RateBeer”:http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/deschutes-the-abyss/65832/ and an “A+ on BeerAdvocate”:http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/63/34420. I can’t argue with either site. This is a great beer.</p>

          <p>Crikey, a week into Spring and it’s snowing!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2368712023/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2195/2368712023_72262b65f4.jpg" alt="IMG_2479.JPG" /></a></p>

<p>It snowed on Wednesday evening, yesterday (followed by sun) and now today. It’s supposed to snow tomorrow too. None of it has stuck but today’s snow appears to be sticking now.</p>

<p><strong>1:30pm update:</strong> Still snowing and we have about 1/4-inch of snow.</p>

<p><strong>3:30pm update:</strong> Snow is gone and the sun is out. Just confirms the adage about Seattle weather: If you don’t like the weather in Seattle, wait 15 minutes.</p>

          <p>I’m still on my oatmeal stout kick, this time it’s “Alaskan’s Oatmeal Stout”:http://www.alaskanbeer.com/stout.html…</p>

<p>This one has more of a dry coffee flavor, but it’s a little watery. Not as good as “Anderson Valley’s version”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/25/anderson-valley-oatmeal-stout/.</p>
