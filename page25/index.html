          <p>The plumber removed the old 3-compartment cast iron sink and plumbed in the new sink yesterday. He still has to come back on Monday to run some more plumbing that I need.</p>

<p>The ventilation hood is built and was delivered this morning along with a 4’x9’ sheet of stainless steel that I’ll use as a backsplash. I installed lengths of unistrut on the ceiling and hung threaded rod, which suspends the ventilation hood. I was reminded of how hard it is to drill in the old-growth 100 year-old wood joists in this house!</p>

<p>The control panel I ordered from <a href="http://theelectricbrewery.com/">The Electric Brewery</a> in November finally arrived today. My favorite builder, Schuchart/Dow, let me borrow their hammer drill so I could drill some holes in the concrete wall. I mounted unistrut on the wall and mounted the control panel to that. </p>

<p>I still need to install the backsplash, install the ductwork for the ventilation hood, modify the kettles and install the electric heating elements and plumbing in the kettles and do some other minor work. I hope to get all that done this weekend and then after the plumber finishes the plumbing, I’ll be ready to brew!</p>

        <article>
          <p>The homebrew club I’m in collectively had 6 years of Abyss bottles so we did a vertical tasting tonight. We had years 2007 through 2012, every year they made it except 2006. Our 2009 was also one of the <a href="http://www.thebrewsite.com/deschutes-has-brett-in-some-beer/">famously Brettanomyces-infected</a> bottles. </p>

<p>All were great, of course, but I liked 2010 and 2011 the best. They still had the distinct coffee and chocolate tastes I love in Russian Imperial Stouts. The flavors in the older ones were more blended together and the 2012 hadn’t developed enough. And I really liked the Brett 2009, it was very unique but not nearly as sour as a typical sour beer. They should make a Brett Abyss on purpose!  </p>

          <p>I got a tip from my homebrewing club that a distillery wanted to sell some barrels, conveniently sized at 6.5 gallons. Gay, Eva and I took a trip down  to Sumner, WA to <a href="http://parliament-distillery.com/">Parliament Distillery</a>, a new small distiller, and picked up 4 barrels: 2 for me and 2 for the homebrew club. I can’t wait to age some stouts, barleywines, IPAs and sour beers in them!</p>

<p>I filled them with water to keep them from drying out until I have beers to put in them. The new brewery setup can’t happen fast enough. </p>

          <p>Gay and I went to the <a href="http://www.washingtonbeer.com/belgianfest/">Belgian Festival</a> today. We had some great beers, most notably a Belgian Dubbel aged in Cabernet barrels and in Bourbon barrels from <a href="http://www.anacortesrockfish.com/brewery.cfm">Anacortes Brewery</a>:</p>

<p>We met Kendall Jones, the <a href="http://www.washingtonbeerblog.com/">Washington Beer Blog</a> guy: </p>

          <p>We picked up the stainless steel table and sink yesterday from the restaurant supply store. We got a smaller table from Costco a couple weeks ago that was too good to pass up. Next week the electrician is coming to add a GFI at the fusebox, add a couple electrical outlets and replace the fluorescent light with a nicer fixture. I also moved my old Klipsch speakers down to the brewery so I can be like <a href="http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2012/10/powermad_todd_haug_surly_interview.php">Surly</a> and blast death metal while I brew. The plumber should be here next week to remove the old sinks, install the new sink and some other minor plumbing work.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/8418266108/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8086/8418266108_26a436d8f8.jpg" alt="Brewery table &amp; sink" /></a></p>

<p>It’s been 11 weeks since I ordered the control panel for the brewery, so if they meet their 10-12 week promise, it should be on its way by the end of this week. I still have to modify the kettles to install input and output valves and the electrical heating elements. I have all the tools and equipment for that now, so I can do that anytime. The ventilation hood should be built in a week or two so I have some time to figure out how I’m going to mount it and connect the vent to the outside. So I could be brewing my first beer on it by mid-February.</p>
