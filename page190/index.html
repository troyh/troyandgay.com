          </h3>
            <p>To stretch the “new car”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/01/05/new-car-2008-lexus-ls-460/’s legs, we drove to Cannon Beach, Oregon to spend a couple days.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>We left Tuesday morning and drove for almost five hours, including ferry-waiting. The car is the most comfortable car I’ve driven ever, I didn’t even begin to get fatigued driving it, something that happens to me after about 3 hours in any other car. The seats are almost as comfortable as my Aeron desk chair and in interior is almost silent even on the highway at 80MPH. And the navigation system is much easier to use and with a higher-res screen than the Jeep Commander’s. Havana did well the entire drive too (but not on the way back).</p>

<p>We checked into “The Ocean Lodge”:http://www.theoceanlodge.com/ hotel around 3pm, relaxed for a bit watching the New Hampshire primary returns on CNN and then went out to dinner at Bill’s Tavern and Brewhouse. The food was okay, we both had fish and chips, but the beer was lousy. It’s the first brewpub I’ve been to where the house beers were undrinkable. The only beer I could get half down was their brown ale, and I don’t like brown ales, which shows how bad their other beers were. We didn’t meet the owner so he didn’t get the chance to tell us how terrible we are as parents like he did to “these people”:http://www.mytravelguide.com/restaurants/profile-46704705-United_States_Oregon_Cannon_Beach_Bills_Tavern_Brewhouse.html. But I wish we did have an encounter like that so I could tell him I’m still a better parent than he is a brewer.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, we drove down Highway 101 to the “Tillamook Cheese Factory”:http://tillamookcheese.com/VisitorsCenter/. That was a fun and scenic drive down the coastline. Tillamook is a huge business but the factory is surprisingly small. There were only a couple dozen employees there. I guess making cheese isn’t that labor-intensive. The bacteria does all the hard work, I guess (free labor!).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2181571945/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2282/2181571945_e57f0604e5.jpg" alt="IMG_1217.JPG" /></a></p>

<p>On advice from a woman at the Tillamook factory, we had lunch at “Pirate’s Cove”:http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g51877-d654438-Reviews-Pirate_s_Cove_Restaurant-Garibaldi_Oregon.html. The food wasn’t very good but  we got the funniest video yet of Havana, which made it worthwhile. Here she’s constantly waving, something we’ve been trying to teach her for weeks:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/gMG52ybkfwc">http://www.youtube.com/v/gMG52ybkfwc</a></p>

<p>Notice in the video that while it looks like she suddenly sees someone outside the window she wants to wave at, there’s nothing out there but ocean. She even does an on-demand clapping at the end. And here she is washing her food down with some milk:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/H52GfbeBhl8">http://www.youtube.com/v/H52GfbeBhl8</a></p>

<p>We drove back to Cannon Beach so Gay could do some shopping while I stayed with a sleeping Havana in the car:</p>

<p>The car has power door-closers which are a godsend when you have a sleeping baby in the car. In the Jeep, we have to quietly close the doors but push them until they lock, but in the Lexus, you lightly close them and it quietly pulls the door closed and Havana can sleep like a baby. I wonder if Lexus thought about babies when they made this feature.</p>

<p>We had dinner that night at “The Wayfarer”:http://www.wayfarer-restaurant.com/. The time to take a baby out to restaurants in a resort town is off-season. All the places we ate were empty or near-empty, which makes it less nerve-racking when the baby decides to scream with delight while she eats. The food here was very good.</p>

<p>Thursday morning we tried to get a photo of Havana on Cannon Beach before we drove home, but it was raining so hard it wasn’t a great opportunity:</p>

<p>We drove through Astoria and right by the “Rogue Public House”:http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/13505, which is uniquely located out on a pier in the Columbia River. It was 11:30am so we kept going before realizing that the next food stop is in Kelso or Longview, not culinary destinations. So we turned around to go back to the Rogue pub.</p>

<p>We were glad we did, we had the best food of the trip there and the beers were great. Plus, having beer for me meant that Gay had to drive the rest of the way home, her first time driving the car. I had a “Kobe beef”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_beef burger with bleu cheese, Gay had a BLT and Havana had a Kobe beef hot dog, which is the best hot dog I’ve ever had. I bought three growlers of their beer to take home too: Festivus, their seasonal beer with a typical malty and sweet flavor, “Menage-a-Frog”:http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/132/34556, a Belgian style tripel (I normally don’t like Belgians, but this is delicious), and their “Brutal Bitter”:http://www.rogue.com/brews.html#brutal.</p>

            <p>It took me six months to do it, but I finally made my first (and probably last) splurge after selling the business: a new car.</p>

<p>h2. Videos</p>

<p>The doors close themselves. Once the door is close enough, it’ll finish the job and close itself:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/uiPAzDolxnU">http://www.youtube.com/v/uiPAzDolxnU</a></p>

<p>I’m not used to it, so I still slam it shut. The trunk opens and closes itself too:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/pseiZhij50E">http://www.youtube.com/v/pseiZhij50E</a>
Accelerating up a steep hill:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/OPzJkWOednY">http://www.youtube.com/v/OPzJkWOednY</a>
It’ll do 0-60 in 5.4 seconds if someone competent is driving it and not going uphill.
There’s no key to put in the ignition, as long as the key fob is inside the car you put your foot on the brake and hit the Start button. Without your foot on the brake, it turns on only the power (or “accessories” as most cars say).Turning it off and back on:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/XfemwY7gOq4">http://www.youtube.com/v/XfemwY7gOq4</a></p>

<p>The stereo also has a DVD player in it, so you can watch movies on the nav screen if you’re not driving. If you aredriving, you only hear the audio of the DVD. This is really handy for us waiting in line and riding ferries.</p>

<p>h2. Choosing a car</p>

<p>I dreamed that if I could ever afford to, I’d walk into a BMW dealer and buy a loaded 7-series “just because I could”. It didn’t work out that way, not only did I not buy a BMW, I didn’t get the loaded model and I didn’t walk into a dealer to do it. In fact, I didn’t even want to buy a car, I’m not a car guy and I realize how financially stupid it is to buy a new car as opposed to a used car. But only having one car was making us uncomfortable when one of us has the car and the other needs a car for convenience or, yikes, an emergency – thoughts of the baby getting hurt and one of us home without a car to take her to hospital will make me do things I would normally consider to be unwise, like buying a new car.The wise financial move would be to get a Honda Accord or something equally practical (and boring) to have as a second car. But getting a car we would prefer not to drive compared to the current car that we like would mean it would sit in the garage and rarely be used so when it was needed, it would have a higher likelihood of not running. Case in point: my 1985 BMW, that is way sexier than a new Honda Accord to me, sat in the garage for years because it wasn’t as comfy as our other car, so it always had a dead battery so it couldn’t be driven when we wanted or needed to. So whatever car we got, it had to be something we’d <em>want</em> to drive. That, to me, is a luxury sedan with all the gadgets.After looking at the market for luxury sedans and deciding which cars I liked the looks of, my choices were BMW 5-series or 7-series, Mercedes-Benz E-class or S-class and the Lexus GS or LS. Making a long story short, I decided on the LS 460. I hemmed and hawed for a while about the longer LS 460 L. And I was interested in the hybrid “LS 600h L”:http://www.motortrend.com/av/roadtests/112_0703_2007_lexus_ls_600_hl_road_test/, but not at $115K and not if it doesn’t get any better gas mileage than the non-hybrid (however, it does meet the “Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle standard”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SULEV).</p>

<p>h2. How to get the best price on a new car</p>

<p>Rather than go into a dealer to negotiate, I essentially did a reverse-auction with nine Lexus dealers from Seattle to Las Vegas via fax and email. Within 24 hours, I had prices ranging from $65K to $69K on the exact car. After telling each one about the lowest price I could find, they all dropped their price to match it or got very close. The sticker price on the car is $73K and the invoice is $63K, so with little work and not having to deal with a single irritating salesperson, I had the price fairly close to invoice. I think that’s pretty good considering the LS 460 is selling extremely well. The auto industry is in a period of declining sales, down 2% over last year, but Lexus is one of the few makers that had increased sales in 2007, up 4% for 2007. Their increase is due mostly to the LS 460, which was redesigned in 2007 – “sales for the LS are up 79%”:http://thepassionatepursuit.com/2008/01/03/lexus-2007-year-end-sales-report/ from 2006, only two other Lexus models (the IS and ES) had higher sales in 2007 versus 2006. For other car makers with less positive sales, I’d expect to get a car for invoice or even less using this method.</p>

<p>I imagine I could have negotiated the price from $73K to $71K or maybe $70K at a dealer. I’d give you all the details here for free about how the car dealer industry works and how to get the best possible price yourself, but instead, I highly recommend paying “FightingChance.com”:http://fightingchance.com/ $40 for the info. That’s what I did and I paid $67K, so that $40 saved me $3000-4000 had I walked into a dealer and spent most of a day negotiating. An alternative is to use “CarBargains”:http://www.checkbook.org/auto/carbarg.cfm, which is a service that will do the same thing I did and only charge you $190. They say they take two weeks to do it, though, while I did it in a few days. Incidentally, I also tried buying it through Costco. They have an auto program that is similar to CarsDirect or other car brokers and promise to get you a good price. On this car, in just minutes on Costco’s web site and after a quick call to a dealer, I was quoted a price of $69K for a car with a $74K sticker price. CarsDirect, on the other hand, said $72K was the best price for that car. If you want a decent price really quick, Costco’s program seems to be good.</p>

<p>h2. Poor Salespeople?</p>

<p>Car dealers hate people like me. They call us “Internet people” but they don’t mean it as a compliment. Of course, they don’t like people who shops around and tries to get the lowest price, they prefer the person who walks in and pays sticker price or who feels good when they get $1000 off sticker. Dealers whine that they are in the only industry where people negotiate on price and people like me take food off their family’s table (although they don’t see the problem with taking food off my table). But they’re wrong. The car industry is the only industry where the retailer <em>expects</em> you to pay the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) and complain when you don’t want to. When you buy a TV, a coffee maker, a bicycle, a gallon of milk or anything besides a car (and an Apple product), you don’t pay MSRP, you pay a price set by competition between retailers and they don’t complain they aren’t getting MSRP.</p>

<p>Unless they’re the world’s worst or dumbest salesperson, if they agree to your price they are earning a profit, no matter how much they claim they aren’t. In fact, on all cars, dealers make a 2-3% profit when selling a car at invoice, the price they claim they paid the manufacturer to get the car. Plus, they earn bonuses if they hit sales targets, so they earn even more. 2-3% isn’t a great profit margin, but it isn’t losing money. Besides, if the old method of buying a car was not so universally hated and they moved towards a more competitive pricing model like the one I’m advocating, they’d likely sell <em>more</em> cars earning them higher incomes even with small profits.</p>

<p>The salespeople earn a commission, usually 20-25% of the profit on the car. The average salesperson sells 100-120 cars per year. If the average profit on a car is $2,000 (the profit on my purchase was over $5,000 which is low for the Lexus LS but profits are higher on luxury cars), the salesperson earns over $50,000/year, not including bonuses. Unless you earn more than that, I wouldn’t be too concerned about the welfare of your car salesperson.</p>

            <p>Better late than never….</p>

<p>A friend of Gay’s from college, <a href="http://www.hattiesrestaurant.com/chefs_corner.htm">Jasper Alexander</a>, was <a href="http://hbtphoto.blogspot.com/2007_01_21_archive.html">on The Food Network last year</a> with Bobby Flay. Jasper and his wife Beth used to live in Seattle and we went to their wedding back when Gay and I were first dating. He worked at Seattle restaurants before moving to Saratoga Springs, New York several years ago to open their own restaurant, <a href="http://www.hattiesrestaurant.com/">Hattie’s Restaurant</a>. Congratulations, Jasper!</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Every Presidential election season, some candidate tries to appeal to the lower- and middle-class voters by suggesting a simpler tax system. This time it’s Huckabee and his “FairTax proposal” where the IRS is abolished and only sales taxes are paid. But it doesn’t make sense.<!-- more --></p>

<p>He’s right that it’s really simple, but it’s a huge tax on the middle-class and a tax cut for the poorest and richest people.The President’s tax reform panel <a href="http://www.taxreformpanel.gov/final-report/TaxReform_Ch9.pdf">evaluated</a> such a plan and concluded that we’d need a Federal Sales Tax rate of 22% (on top of the current state sales tax rates!) to be a replacement for income tax. So poor people, who buy fewer things, pay less taxes, which is good. But rich people, who buy more expensive things, would have a big tax hike in sales tax, but they’d not pay income taxes, capital gains taxes, dividend taxes or estate taxes at all which would more than make up for the tax hike. So if the poor and the rich pay lower taxes, guess who pays higher taxes? Everyone else: the middle-class.</p>

<p>This chart shows where federal taxes come from today versus the sales tax plan: <img src="http://troyh.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/p_2048_1536_ef28b242-2aed-4481-b2ea-6a8b3646d5c1.jpegpix/2008/01/picture-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The left side shows what percentage of the total US tax bill is paid by each quintile (1/5th) of the population. The richest 20% of the population pays 84.2% of the total tax bill, the lower- and middle-classes pay the remaining 15.8%. But under a sales tax plan, the richest 20% would pay only 65% of the total tax bill, a tax cut, leaving everyone else to pay 35%, a tax increase.</p>

<p>Worse, the wealthier you are, the bigger the tax cut. The right side of the chart shows that the bottom 50% of the US population would have a massive tax hike, while the top 10% would get almost a 30% tax cut, a 36% tax cut for the top 5% and a 42% tax cut for the top 1%.</p>

<p>The other parts that advocates of a Federal sales tax neglect is the incentive the government is giving people with higher sales taxes. People would purchase fewer goods, so employees of companies that produce products, i.e., just about everyone, would be paid less because their employer makes less.  It also encourages a black market for goods – who wouldn’t try to buy a product and pay only 10% extra on the black market when the government is charging 22-30%?</p>

<p>Fortunately, such a tax plan would never happen since it makes no sense. But I’m sure it won’t stop Huckabee from talking about how great an idea it is.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>I’ve written “most of this already”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2007/11/05/11-months-in-review/, but in the interest of having a New Year’s Day post…</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The year started off like every previous year, just working, working, working, lots of ideas and plans for the company and looking forward to another great year for the site. Gay was five months pregnant and I was getting anxious and nervous about being a dad and trying to figure out how I’d be able to concentrate on work yet give her enough attention. It turns out that was easier than I thought. More on that below.</p>

<p>We finished having the house painted, which took two months, and we were getting the nursery and her bathroom ready. Gay was buying all the furniture, baby carriage, car seat and clothes – the UPS guy was the only person outside of the family and circle of friends who knew a baby was coming. We knew it was a girl and we were picking names. Gay was spending less time working at this point and I was trying to keep busy working because I knew I’d be working a lot less in the weeks after she was born. I had no idea that it’d be months of hardly working! It turns out there’s a reason people get maternity/paternity leave, I always thought they were slackers.</p>

<p>In April, Havana Elle was born, happy and healthy. Seeing your baby born is one of life’s great experiences. People who had babies told me that and I always nodded politely and said “Yeah, I can imagine”, but I assumed it was just one of those platitudes parents have to say. She looked like an alien with a huge head and eyes and black hair and crying. I wasn’t looking forward to it and didn’t know how I’d handle it, but I’m glad I was there and I’ll never forget the instant I first saw her. It helps that they do a good job keeping the blood and gore out of sight and they clean ‘em up really quick. Since we knew she was a girl, I could appreciate the experience without having to ask “Is it a boy or a girl?”, it’s enough to figure out if she has the proper number of arms, legs, fingers, toes, eyes, ears, etc. (She does).</p>

<p>Right after she was born, I took up the shortest-lived hobby I’ve ever had: cigar-smoking. I got 10 Cuban cigars, Cohibas no less, to give out to people because of tradition, but mostly because her name was Havana. Five were Robustos and the other five were Siglo IIs. I didn’t know anything about them, I just picked them out of a line-up on a web site. They weren’t cheap, the 10 of them cost me $350! But it was money well-spent, I loved those cigars! I ended up smoking four of them and only gave out six. I don’t smoke and have never liked smoking, but those cigars were amazing. I bought myself a humidor, a cutter, a nice lighter and, not wanting to make a habit of skirting the US embargo on Cuba, I ordered a dozen Dominican cigars of various brands. I hated them all. But I didn’t give up that easily. I splurged again and got a five-pack of “Davidoff’s”:http://www.davidoff.com/, which are supposed to be some of the best outside of Cuba. I didn’t like those either. At this point, I’m an even bigger supporter of “ending the Cuban embargo”:http://www.portfolio.com/views/columns/washington/2007/11/19/Cuba-Embargo-Reasons-to-End, but until it’s over, I’ll have to confine my cigar habit to trips outside the US. And my humidor will be empty.</p>

<p>Gay’s mom, dad and aunts visited for a few days a few weeks later and I was an old pro at taking care of her. She cried and it didn’t bother me at all and the first few weeks in I was a way better dad than Gay was a mom, if I do say so myself. Then it all changed. The cry-eat-cry-sleep-cry hourly cycle was wearing thin. I was sick of waking up at all hours to try to get her to go to sleep or change a diaper in the dark. Havana and I were bitter enemies for many months. Now it’s safe to say that Gay is the better parent and I’m just the guy who helps out here and there when the nanny isn’t around.</p>

<p>In May we agreed to sell our company and by July, the deal was closed and I was ready to get back to work on the site that had been kept alive by our hard-working employees. Gay went to Spokane for her 20-year high school reunion the next week with Havana and I enjoyed a couple days of peace and quiet and alone time, something I get very little of these days. We went to Walla Walla for a weekend for Gay’s 15-year college reunion, 16 years after graduating (2007 minus 1991 equals 15 if you go to a liberal arts school), and we visited a few wineries.</p>

<p>Work was boring, our responsibilities were almost completely taken away and we were kept at arm’s length from the site. We could have worked for years doing nothing and earning fat salaries and enjoying good healthcare but we were both miserable. After eight years of loving your job and being excited to get out of bed in the morning, even a few weeks of boredom in your job and wondering why you should get out of bed in the morning, or worse, having to get out of bed to attend a conference call, was unacceptable. Our days were numbered.</p>

<p>In September we went to Hawaii for a week. Neither of us had been there before. It was relaxing, all we did was hang out by the pool with Havana and enjoyed the weather. Hawaii is like the American version of Bali to me, but the type of American that is supposed to be an improvement on the real thing and never is. But it was easy and sedate, which is what we wanted. The day after we got back, we quit our jobs.</p>

<p>Gay’s mom visited again for a week or so in early November and she acted as a fill-in nanny while our nanny was in Brazil. My parents made it out for Thanksgiving and to see Havana for the first time in person, and they also acted as nannies. Until then, regular Skype video calls were a great replacement for face-to-face contact – they could see her grow from the beginning thanks to Skype. As Ali G says: “Tekmology!”</p>

<p>Havana “can almost crawl”:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJWxd6UuclU, but if you hold her hands she can walk anywhere she pleases. She seems to love the freedom of being partially mobile. She doesn’t talk yet either, just makes the same noises like “Baaa Baaa” and “Maaa Maaa” (which I assume is “Mama”), she grunts a lot when she’s trying to crawl and she still says “Gack!” a lot. She’s even developed “an odd laugh”:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LacScf6HxQ. She likes to reach out and pet the dogs. Ouzo puts up with it but Illy gives us a look like “Can you make her stop? I’m sleeping here.” She’s been eating solid foods for a while now, even adult food at times, and can hold her own bottle of milk and feed herself. She loves Cheerios and bananas for breakfast, peas, apples, pasta, baby food or really anything for other meals, she doesn’t appear to be picky. It’s all finger-food now, she’s not yet figured out the spoon herself. She sleeps through the night usually too, which is a boon to Gay, but I learned to sleep through the night (and her cries) many months ago.</p>
