            <p>Teddy Roosevelt on people who actually do things versus those who criticize them (from <a href="http://www.workhappy.net/2006/11/happy_quote.html">WorkHappy</a>):</p>

<blockquote>"It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself for a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat."</blockquote>

            <p>Gay got me a <a href="http://www.fullers-ales.com/esb.php">Fuller’s ESB</a> tap handle from eBay. I couldn’t believe it when I saw it. I bet there’s not more than 100 people in the US who have one of these at home. If only the beer that came out of the tap was Fuller’s. :)</p>

<p>For those of you who haven’t heard me rattle on about how perfect this beer is, it’s my favorite beer, the beer I’d choose if I could only have one beer the rest of my life. And I was fortunate enough to have a keg of it served at our wedding. I even convinced a Vashon restaurant to serve it when they first opened (but they’ve since stopped since I didn’t drink enough of it to justify the cost, apparently).

            <p>Back when I was at Microsoft, one of my projects was to add integration of NetMeeting (Microsoft’s online videoconferencing product) into Outlook. In 1998, if I recall correctly, <a href="http://mbookspan.spaces.live.com/">Matthew Bookspan</a> wrote a patent filing for this feature and added my name to it. All I did was review the thing, if that. And lo and behold, <a href="http://assignments.uspto.gov/assignments/q?db=pat&amp;qt=pat&amp;reel=&amp;frame=&amp;pat=6363352&amp;pub=&amp;asnr=&amp;asnri=&amp;asne=&amp;asnei=&amp;asns=">the patent</a> was granted in 2002.</p>

<p>Frankly, though, it’s a patent that shouldn’t have been granted. I didn’t think it had a chance at the time, since we didn’t do anything that wasn’t terribly obvious. Now I’m part of <a href="http://lpf.ai.mit.edu/Patents/patents.html">the software patent problem</a>.</p>

            <p>A few weeks ago I got email from someone in Australia named “Troy Hakala” who found this site. “Hakala” is a common name in Finland, but “Troy” is relatively rare, but I’ve never heard of another Troy Hakala before. And I dominate <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=troy+hakala&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">a Google search for Troy Hakala</a>, which makes someone who loves his anonymity uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Today I found that the other Troy Hakala has been published on <a href="http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=5067">Opinion Online</a>. It sounds like Australia is no better than the US on gay rights.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://decemberists.com/">Decemberists</a>’ new album, <em>The Crane Wife</em>, is out. I wasn’t even expecting a new album, even <em>after</em> I bought the single on iTunes last week. It’s not quite the same as previous albums, it’s more 70s rock than the kinda folky-shanty that I thought they sounded like on older albums. I swear The Island has a little classic rock (Deep Purple?) keyboard in it, very weird.</p>

<p>For crying out loud, they have <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thedecemberists">a MySpace page</a>. Isn’t MySpace uncool yet? Wait til the kids find out that the eXtreme-unhip Rupert Murdoch owns it.</p>
