          <p>“CNN”:http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/19/robertson.bush.iraq/index.html: <em>The founder of the U.S. Christian Coalition said Tuesday he told President George W. Bush before the invasion of Iraq that he should prepare Americans for the likelihood of casualties, but the president told him, “We’re not going to have any casualties.”</em></p>

<p><em>Update:</em> The White House is “denying”:http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/19/robertson.bush.iraq/index.html Bush ever said it and Pat Robertson stood by his statement. Pat Robertson has said  (and continues to say) some pretty odd things, but someone’s lying. You can usually tell by asking yourself: Who has more to gain from lying?</p>

          <p>They’re <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002064801_oilspill16m.html">close to catching</a> the people who spilled the oil all over south Puget Sound and Vashon. One of the two suspects “has a history of pollution incidents”. A few lawsuits will make the corporation be more careful next time.</p>

          <p>We made it to Taipei! We watched a movie called <a href="http://www.thenotebookmovie.com/">The Notebook</a> on the plane. Never heard of it, but Gay cried like a baby. After a 2-hour layover we’re off to San Francisco for an 11-hour flight. Hopefully we’ll make our connecting flight to Seattle, catch the 11:30pm ferry to Vashon and be at home by midnight. :)</p>

          <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2130.jpg" alt="IMG_2130.jpg" />We went to the shipping place and arranged for our shipment. Then came back to the hotel for our massage and facial. I’ve never had a massage before and certainly not a facial and I was apprehensive about it, but it was fun.</p>

<p>We had our private dinner on the beach. It was very windy, but the wind kept the mosquitos and humidity away. The dinner was a four-course meal: prawns sembala, papaya soup, duck with rice and vegetables and dessert was a fruit plate with black rice pudding. Everything was very very good. And we had a good bottle of wine too.</p>

<p>We were very full and it was late when we came back to our room at 9pm. We fell asleep on the lounge chairs by the pool.</p>

<p>I realized we hadn’t posted photos of our hotel room, so here’s a few random ones of the area outside the room starting with the entrance to the villa/room. The “room” is surrounded by a 7-foot wall so we had plenty of privacy and living area.</p>
