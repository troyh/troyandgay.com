              <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2247.jpg" alt="IMG_2247.jpg" />Yesterday, we went to look at carpet samples. This time we went to the local Vashon furniture store, of all places, and were surprised to find a good selection there. We have a carpet we think we like. And then we put primer on the walls to prep for painting.</p>

<p>We’re still deciding what colors to paint the walls and trim. We got some samples yesterday but didn’t like them once we put them on the wall, but we got a better idea about the direction we want to go. We went to the hardware store and picked out more samples to try out. We’ll put those on after the Steelers game…</p>

<p>…Steelers won! We painted some colors on the wall. I think we’re set on the white for the walls and for the carpet, but the trim color is still a problem. We want the windows to show all the color of the outdoors so we want the interior colors to be less noticeable so as not to detract from the windows.</p>

              <p>The drywall guys keep coming back for just a couple hours to put another coat on the new drywall. It looks done at this point. But they said yesterday they have to come back this morning for 20 minutes to put primer on.</p>

<p>Not exactly sure what’s next, either we’re going to paint the walls or they’re going to trim the window frames. The electrical work needs to be finished up, meaning putting the plates and jacks in and installing the in-wall heaters. After that, we’ll paint the trim and decide on flooring and get that installed. Then it’s done.</p>

<p>We’ve been thinking we’d do bamboo flooring, but now we’re thinking carpet instead. It’s less expensive, will be more durable against our dogs’ claws, Illy doesn’t like wood floors and carpet will be warmer. Decisions, decisions…</p>

              <p>I finally solved the <a href="http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2709">Airport Express problem</a> I’ve had since I got it. The Airport Express would simply “drop-out” for a second or more. This wasn’t that noticeable when streaming music since iTunes buffers so much that a short loss of network connectivity had no effect. But when I used it to <a href="http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2888">set up our temporary office</a>, the drops were much more noticeable since I live in ssh sessions to various servers.</p>

<p>After lots of trial and error, I simply unplugged our older Linksys access point. It’s an 802.11b access point and the Express was getting confused between it and the newer 802.11g access point also in the house. Not a single dropped connection since! Fortunately, it doesn’t appear that we need the 802.11b since the greater range of the 802.11g access point seems to cover the house.</p>

              <a class="post-link" href="/2004/11/17/is-wal-mart-good-for-america.html">Is Wal-Mart good for America?</a>
            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>We watched <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/walmart/">Frontline’s show about Wal-Mart</a> last night. Wal-Mart’s incredible power in the marketplace is not new information, but the extent to which Wal-Mart is benefitting China is new to me.</p>

<p>Wal-Mart’s mission to drive prices down for American consumers has the effect of squeezing American manufacturers to the point of bankruptcy, given that they can only go so low on wages to their employees. But China’s labor costs are extremely low, so Wal-Mart is increasingly relying on China’s manufacturers to give Americans their low prices.</p>

<p>That’s great for China, obviously, but maybe not so good for America. As one interviewee points out, it’d be wonderful for Americans if Americans were consumers only because they’re saving money, but Americans also need jobs. And this has a profound effect on our trade deficit – the US exports $3 billion worth of goods to China and imports $36 billion a year. In fact, our exports (raw materials, mostly) are being used by the Chinese manufacturers to build products that they sell back to us.</p>

<p>One American company fought back, though, and won. Five Rivers, an American manufacturer of television components, sued and <a href="http://www.laborresearch.org/story.php?id=339">forced anti-dumping tariffs on China</a>. This effectively increased the costs to Chinese manufacturers for television components (Wal-Mart helped to defend the Chinese manufacturers in the legal case). But it may have been too late for Five Rivers – <a href="http://www.thedailytimes.com/sited/story/html/176894">they filed for bankruptcy last month</a>.</p>

<p>What made America strong economically, a large population of consumers with money to spend, could come to an end given that our jobs are decreasing in pay. With four times the population and increasing wages, China’s larger market of wealthier people could make China <em>the</em> economic superpower that dwarfs America’s economy.</p>

<p>Is this simply capitalism running its course? Is it the global economy being realized? Is Wal-Mart a company that is transforming American retail business to the benefit of the American economy? Or is Wal-Mart single-handedly turning China into an economic superpower? Will <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/business/20041117-1017-wallstreet.html">today’s merger of K-Mart and Sears</a>, two of Wal-Mart’s victims, create a second Wal-Mart and increase our reliance on China?</p>
