              <p>We know that Michael Powell’s FCC prefers to let the <a href="http://www.gtlaw.com/pub/alerts/2003/brecherm_06.asp">few media corporations control all the media</a> in the US. And Jeff Jarvis just proved that the FCC, in general, allows the few to control what we see on TV – <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2004_11_15.html#008481">complaints from just three people</a> was enough to make the FCC levy a record $1.2 million fine against Fox. No wonder networks were afraid to show <em>Saving Private Ryan</em> under this new FCC.</p>

              <p>Pittsburgh easily beat the Browns today, their 7th straight win, giving them the best record in the NFL at 8-1. If Philadelphia beats the Cowboys tomorrow night, they will also be 8-1 (Pittsburgh crushed Philadelphia last week, 27-3).</p>

<p>I think the Steelers will be in the Super Bowl this year. :)</p>

              <p>[](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&amp;id=0&amp;t=45)After several attempts in the last few months, I’ve finally switched to “Firefox”:http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/index.html as my default browser and I like it! It’s easier to access the tabs (Cmd+1 for tab 1, Cmd+2 for tab 2, etc.), other apps open windows in new tabs so less clutter on my screen, it’s fast, smooth-scrolling, popup-blocking and my favorite feature, I can add any search engine to the Search box (Safari only allowed Google). Other niceties include easy searching on the page (just start typing) and it doesn’t let me mistakenly close the window and all tabs when I really just wanted to close the one tab. And, for web developers, the “web developer toolbar”:http://www.chrispederick.com/work/firefox/webdeveloper/ is amazing.</p>

<p>My only complaint is that the fonts are bigger than they are on Safari, and there’s no preference to change it.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Last night, I wanted to try out “NewsFire”:http://www.newsfirerss.com/ but I didn’t want to go to the trouble of adding all my feeds that I read on “MyWireService”:http://mywireservice.com. It would be nice if NewsFire (or any RSS aggregator) could just work against MyWireService to get my news. Two things made this possible: 1) Gay was out for the night again volunteering for the Vashon debate team to help them in another tournament this weekend and 2) I wrote MyWireService so I can make it do anything I want. :)</p>

<p>So while I watched the end of “Gothika”:http://gothikamovie.warnerbros.com/ (ugh, terrible movie) on TiVo and had a glass of wine, I added a cool feature to MyWireService: it can now generate an RSS feed of all the updates to all the RSS feeds in each of my sections. So I can use any RSS aggregator to read my news and continues to solve “the RSS bandwidth problem”:http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1648625,00.asp. And possibly even better, I saved Gay from having to watch <em>Gothika</em>.</p>

<p>And even better, we can now do some cool stuff, and very easily, with food-related news on “Recipezaar”:http://www.recipezaar.com that we’ve been planning. Since Gay won’t be home til late tonight and it’s too wet to mow the lawn, I have my Saturday project planned. :)</p>
