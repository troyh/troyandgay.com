        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Today we went to the new <a href="http://www.frys.com/">Fry’s</a> in Seattle (Renton, actually). I’ve been to the one in Silicon Valley in 1996 and was amazed, but never got to enjoy having a Fry’s until now. The store is <strong>huge</strong> and the parking lot is like two football fields (it’s the size parking lot that Costco should have). In fact, the place is like Costco without being a warehouse. This was the Grand Opening weekend so it was just packed with people; people who blocked all the aisles with carts so you could barely walk through the store.</p>

<p>It’s basically a super Best Buy or Circuit City but what really impresses me is the breadth of stuff for PCs. You can buy every piece of a computer and assemble it entirely from this store, including specialty cables, cooling fans, tricked-out cases, etc.  Seeing an aisle of motherboards with about 30 on display is something I’ve never seen anywhere. And the prices are great if you know what you’re looking for; I got a 200GB Western Digital hard drive for $95 after rebates. That’s less than 50¢ per GB which is easily half the best price I’ve ever seen for a hard drive.</p>

<p>They even have a separate Apple area (with an Apple logo’d archway) with all the Apple hardware, including the extras (we got a replacement iBook battery too). A <a href="http://apple.com/g5">G5</a> was on display, so I got to see that for the first time in person.</p>

<p>The employees seemed overwhelmed by the number of people and they weren’t familiar with the store, but there are lots of employees – it was easy to find one to ask a question. For example, it took a good 10 minutes and three employees to find a power cord (not located anywhere near the power supplies). To get out we had to be herded through an amusement-park-like line to get to the 65 (!) cash registers. But it was pretty quick process to get checked-out.</p>

          <p><a href="http://recipezaar.com">67,000</a> recipes! We’re over two-thirds of the way to 100,000 recipes. Recipezaar is the largest database of recipes on the internet (<a href="http://recipesource.com">RecipeSource</a> claims “7 times larger than 10,000” but it’s so easy to find non-recipes and duplicates that it’s safe to say they have fewer than 67,000).</p>

          <p>I don’t know who is more stupid, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A64800-2003Aug29?language=printer">the kid</a> who made the Blaster-variant virus or the FBI that took a week to find him. He put the URL to his own web server in the code with a domain name registered to himself and he bragged about it on his web site (<a href="http://216.239.53.104/search?q=cache:FEZleHDR3mcJ:t33kid.com/hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8">Google cache</a>) and the executable’s name is his own nickname.</p>

          <p>Ugh! I hate when I read about <a href="http://www.kingcountyjournal.com/sited/story/html/141697">bicyclists getting hit by cars</a>. But it sounds like she was riding on the sidewalk, which is not a good idea.</p>

          <p>This is probably how <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1477729/08282003/spears_britney.jhtml?headlines=true">the kiss</a> happened:</p>

<p><em>Madonna, an expert at crafting moments like these, was likely the kiss architect, and didnt have to clear it with anyone but herself. Britney on the other hand probably deferred Madonnas plan to her managers, who then held target-marketing studies, clicked through a series of PowerPoint pie charts in dimly-lit conference rooms, crunched Excel spreadsheet numbers, calibrated their Britney-Coming-Of-Age barometer to see if the time was right for such a display (sexy enough to titillate the kids, while toned-down enough to bypass conservative, middle-America parental units), tabulated the results to arrive at yes, stuck a wind-up key in Britneys back, turned it clockwise a few turns, and pushed her out on stage to seal the deal.</em> [via <a href="http://whatdoiknow.org/archives/001139.shtml">What Do I Know</a>]</p>
