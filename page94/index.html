              <p>We celebrated Havana’s birthday today. We invited a bunch of her friends from her preschool and their parents, Jon &amp; Megan and Steve &amp; Renuka and their kids, Owen and Claire. We rented a bouncy house for the day which the kids loved and had snacks, cake, beer and wine. And the cake was delicious.</p>

<p>The slide in the house also got a lot of use by the kids and there was only one injury.</p>

<p>Jon, Megan, Steve, Renuka, Owen and Claire stayed late and the kids watched Pixar’s <em>Cars</em> quietly while we had dinner (that we ate after dessert!).</p>

              <p>Havana turned 3 today. Tomorrow is her party.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4568439727/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4031/4568439727_c09448f13e.jpg" alt="IMG_5515" /></a></p>

<p>While running this morning with my iPod on random, this song came on and I couldn’t help but think of Havana on her birthday:</p>

<blockquote>What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all 'round the sun

What a beautiful dream
That could flash on the screen
In a blink of an eye and be gone from me
Soft and sweet
Let me hold it close and keep it here with me

And one day we will die
And our ashes will fly
From the aeroplane over the sea
But for now we are young
Let us lay in the sun
And count every beautiful thing we can see</blockquote>

<p>As an adult, it’s easy to forget how short life is and how you don’t even know  how much time you have. Kids haven’t yet learned to think about time, the past or the future so they enjoy <em>now</em>. I hope both our kids never lose that.</p>

<p>Havana, I hope you’re as happy and have as much fun at 30 as you do at 3.</p>

The single, “Bloodbuzz Ohio”, is <a href="http://www.highviolet.com/">available free for download</a> too. I’ve been waiting almost 3 years, since their brilliant album “Boxer”, for their next album. Just 18 more days to wait.</p>

              <p>Havana’s preschool had their annual fund-raiser auction tonight. Megan &amp; Jon agreed to be our guests and Gay volunteered her and I to work the auction.  Gay was a cashier and I helped clear the tables after each silent auction ended, which allowed me more time to mingle with Jon and Megan.</p>

<p>I won the auction for the very stuff we donated: a box of big beers, 2 beer glasses and a beer book. That really means that we paid for it twice, but it’s for a good cause, and I really like the glasses. I also bid on a trip to Walla Walla, Washington’s wine country and Gay’s college town, for a couple nights at the <a href="http://www.marcuswhitmanhotel.com/">Marcus Whitman Hotel</a> and a weekend of wine-tasting. I won that too. I’m travelled-out for a while but now we have to schedule a trip to Walla Walla.</p>
