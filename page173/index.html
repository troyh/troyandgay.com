            <p>They haven’t picked an offensive lineman, presumably because all the best linemen went to other teams ahead of them. They took a running back, Rashard Mendenhall, and a receiver, Limas Sweed.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Rashard Mendenhall: He looks like a big and fast running back, which is good, but don’t they need a power running back like Jerome Bettis or Franco Harris? Are they writing off Najeh Davenport already?</p>

<p>Limas Sweed: Since Roethlisberger is always throwing on the run, due to a lack of a good offensive line, a tall receiver like this guy should be easier to throw to.</p>

<p>We still need a boy’s name for our upcoming baby. Rashard? No. Limas? Mmmm, no. The search continues…</p>

            <p>Sometimes you see a story about America and you realize how ignorant some Americans are. The “story of an atheist who was harassed in the military”:http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/04/26/atheist.soldier.ap/index.html is one of those stories:</p>

<p>bq. Known as “the atheist guy,” Hall has been called immoral, a devil worshipper and – just as severe to some soldiers – gay, none of which, he says, is true. Hall even drove fellow soldiers to church in Iraq and paused while they prayed before meals.</p>

<p>Note that the author couldn’t just write that he’s not immoral, a devil-worshipper or gay, they had to qualify it with a “he says” because even the author of the story about prejudice isn’t quite sure if it’s possible for an atheist to be moral, straight and not believe in the devil.</p>

<p>It reminds me of my high school life in Virginia where other kids were shocked, shocked!, to find out I was an atheist. Most equated atheism to satanism and some were brave, or maybe stupid, enough to ask if I held “rituals” or believed that sacrificing animals or humans was okay. If I could keep from rolling my eyes, it was fun to answer “it depends on the person” and just stare at them. Ahh, high school, those were the days. There was even one football player, who was a big guy and much bigger than me, who I had been somewhat friends with, never talked to me after he found out I was an atheist and he admitted that he avoided me in the halls out of <em>fear</em>. Fear! Granted, that’s redneck-ville Virginia, but I bet most Americans have similar feelings today. According to Gallup polls, “that’s true”:http://atheism.about.com/od/atheistbigotryprejudice/a/AtheistSurveys.htm:</p>

<p>bq. 52% [of Americans] have a mostly unfavorable or worse attitude [towards atheists]</p>

<p>It turns out that atheists are the most hated minority in America. In fact, I’m more discriminated against than Scientologists! Oh well, at least I’m in good company. Here’s a list of famous atheists:</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln, Albert Einstein, Aldous Huxley, Andrew Carnegie, Ernest Hemingway, Arthur C. Clarke, Charles Darwin (duh!), Ayn Rand, Benjamin Franklin, Galileo, Leo Tolstoy, Kurt Vonnegut, John Lennon, Walt Disney, Frank Lloyd Wright, Alfred Hitchcock, George Orwell, Charles Schultz, Robert Heinlen, Mark Twain, Robert Frost, Susan B. Anthony, Vincent Van Gogh, Thomas Jefferson (woo hoo!), Thomas Edison, Thomas Paine, Ingmar Bergman, Sigmund Freud, Oscar Wilde, David Hume, Albert Camus, Brian Eno, Mike Mills, Michael Stipe, Robert Smith, Bob Odenkirk, Michael Lewis, Ian McKellen, Douglas Coupland, Warren Buffett, Douglas Adams, Howard Stern, Robin Quivers, Michael Crichton, Woody Allen, Linus Torvalds, Sarah Vowell, Noam Chomsky, John Malkovich, Frank Zappa, Salman Rushdie, Berkeley Breathed (former Vashon-Islander!), Ricky Gervais, Lance Armstrong, Isaac Asimov, Chumbawamba, Marlon Brando, Richard Branson, Isaac Brock and Peter Buck (that makes 75% of R.E.M.!) and, of course, Richard Dawkins.</p>

<p>The list goes “on and on and on”:http://www.celebatheists.com/?title=Main_Page…</p>

          </h3>
            <p>“Speaking in Seattle”:http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/04/bill-gates-what.html, this statement on open source has to go down in history as one of Bill Gates’ dumbest statements ever:</p>

<p>bq. Open source, he said, creates a license “so that nobody can ever improve the software,”</p>

<p>The truth is that open source creates a license so that <em>anyone</em> can <em>always</em> improve the software. That’s the opposite of what he believes. Religion. On the bright side, he’s giving lots of money to scientists to cure diseases around the world. Then again, he won’t allow scientists that get grant money from his foundation to use open source software and requires that they purchase software from a certain software company.</p>

<p>He likes to claim that open source is anti-capitalist too. He may be a capitalist, but he’s no economist. If he were an economist, he would understand that Microsoft may not have made as much money if they sold open source software, but all the companies that spend millions on Microsoft software would have saved a lot of money. If they didn’t have to pay for software, they could employ more people or spend more on research and development. More R&amp;D and more employed people drives the economy forward, which is very capitalist.</p>

<p>To put it in perspective, Microsoft makes $51 billion a year in revenue selling software to businesses. Instead of paying for software, their customers could employ 510,000 additional people with salaries of $100K every year. But Microsoft employs less than 80,000 people, so Microsoft alone causes a net loss of 430,000 high-paid ($100K/yr) jobs per year or 1,290,000 people of average-salaried ($33K/yr) jobs per year to the world’s economy.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We had a rare date night last night and we went to “La Spiga”:http://www.laspiga.com/, an Italian restaurant. These days when we go out we go early so we can get home and to bed by 9pm. This works out well for me because restaurants have this many people in them at 5:30pm:</p>

<p>I love having a restaurant all to myself – you get attentive service and you don’t overhear conversations between people who think they have something important enough to say that the whole restaurant needs to hear it. To be fair, the place was more crowded by the end of our dinner and there were no loud-talkers.</p>

<p>The food was good, not great, but good. I had gnocchi and a rack of lamb, which was cooked perfectly. Gay had a tagliatelle pasta with a meat sauce and veal dish for a second. I don’t know much about Italian wines but the waitress recommended a good one, which it should be at $14/glass. Since Gay can’t drink, I order glasses of wine at restaurants (unless it’s a good beer place) and I’ve discovered that a glass of wine is expensive these days. It must be more common now to order glasses of wine at restaurants. One glass of wine cost more than my first course!</p>

<p>The best part of the restaurant is the decor. It’s a large place with old exposed timber beams, concrete walls with steel fixtures. Very modern but still very casual.</p>
