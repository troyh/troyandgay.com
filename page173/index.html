          <p>We left the hotel in Eugene, Oregon at 8:30am and got home at 1:40pm with just one stop in Lacey, WA for coffee and a diaper-change. Total driving was 2,581 miles.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Havana was a great little traveller, she slept in the car almost on her normal schedule, ate while driving and only cried when she needed her diaper changed, was hungry or was really really bored. Each time we stopped, even 10 minutes was enough to get her out of the car seat and walk her around to look at things and she was happy to go back in the car again.</p>

<p>At the hotels she slept in her “Pack ‘n Play”:http://www.gracobaby.com/productguide/firsttime_playards.aspx just like it was her normal bed. We brought the comforter, bumpers and blankets from her crib so it was just like home. We usually put it in the bathroom where it was dark and almost every night she went to sleep without any problems and slept through the night.</p>

<p>At restaurants she was well-behaved, only a few times squealing with giddyness when she got her food and she made friends with other customers at almost every restaurant. She usually left a mess under her highchair so we always tipped extra well to cover that hassle for the waiter/waitress.</p>

<p>Gas prices seemed pretty normal, the highest we saw was $4.05/gallon for premium in Los Gatos, but we never paid more than $3.80/gallon or less than $3.40/gallon.</p>

          <p>The longest day of driving yet. We left Los Gatos Tuesday morning at 8:30am and 570 miles later got to Eugene at 7pm. That’s an average of 54 MPH including stops! Not bad.</p>

<p>We hit traffic almost immediately, routed around it and got to “Vacaville, CA”:http://www.ci.vacaville.ca.us/ before Havana needed a break. Next stop was in “Willows, CA”:http://www.city-data.com/city/Willows-California.html for lunch at Subway and some time in the town playground to give Havana some activity. A diaper-change in “Dunsmuir, CA”:http://ci.dunsmuir.ca.us/n/cod/ and a stop at a rest stop in Oregon were all that were needed to get to Eugene.</p>

<p>After a relaxing dinner again at Steelhead Brewery, we checked into the hotel, watched some TV and went to bed.</p>

        <article>
          <p>While on vacation, I got email from Rebekkah Denn, the food writer for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, who was doing an article on all the food sites in Seattle. I replied to her in email and “the article is online now”:http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/food/355475_foodwebs19.html. This isn’t the first time we’ve been asked this question and it amazes me how far people go to rationalize the premise that Seattle is a center for food-related online businesses. Even in her list of top 10 sites, four are in New York (About.com/food, KraftFoods.com, food.aol.com, and epicurious.com) but only two are in Seattle. Seattle, Starbucks and microbreweries had nothing to do with why we started Recipezaar. If anything, Microsoft is the reason there are online companies here.</p>

<p>Email correspondence:</p>

<p>bq. We’re on vacation in California right now, what’s the timing on your article?</p>

<p>bq. To answer your question, we think it’s just a coincidence that there are/were so many food-related sites started in Seattle. When we started, we didn’t even know about AllRecipes or Food.com and quickly learned that the makers of MasterCook software were also in Seattle. No idea why, really. I know that AllRecipes took one or two  MasterCook employees, but other than that, I don’t think there’s any relation between any of us.  I’m guessing it’s just that there are so many tech people in the area.</p>

<p>bq. Quickly, Recipezaar came about because Gay and I were bored at Microsoft and wanted to start our own business. This was in 1999. After various ideas, we decided to do a recipe site since there were tons of them around but all were pretty lousy – we felt we could build the better product. So we tried. :-)  Recipes made sense to us as a self-funded startup because 1) we didn’t need to store inventory (low startup costs), 2) recipes can’t be copyrighted so we couldn’t be sued the way Napster was at the time (low legal fees), 3) recipes are structured information that, if understood by the computer, could be made more useful to people than just text on a page and 4) it was all software, which is our only skill. We weren’t great cooks (still aren’t), as you might expect. As we always said “We just like to eat”. ;-)</p>

<p>bq. If you want to talk more, email’s fine with us if you aren’t in a hurry to write your article. We’re on vacation, so email could be sporadic for the next week or so with us. If you want to talk by phone, we can schedule some time.</p>

<p>bq. Dear Troy –</p>

<p>bq. I understand you and Gay aren’t with recipezaar now, but wondered if you might share some thoughts with me on its origins. I’m working on an article for our food section at the P-I,
noting how many successful recipe and restaurant sites were founded in the Seattle area, and trying to get some idea of why. Is it just that we had so many tech people here, and were
a logical place for any website about any topic? Or was there anything else to it?  (I would have assumed the former, but I don’t see the same concentration of successful
food sites in the Bay Area, say, or New York.)</p>

<p>bq. If you have any thoughts, or if you don’t mind telling the story of how Recipezaar came about one more time, I’d love to talk. E-mail works, but if phone is easier, my cell is [removed].</p>

<p>bq. Best wishes,</p>

          <p>We were planning to go home on Monday but decided to go to Los Gatos instead. After a quick stop at Starbucks, we headed south out of the city. We hit rush hour traffic so exited the highway and drove through Silicon Valley (again).</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>We found ourselves in Sunnyvale so drove by Yahoo! for old time’s sake since they’re likely to be acquired by Microsoft soon and Yahoo will surely disappear for one reason or another. We were then headed right by Apple again so we stopped in to see if we could get into the company store since we were there on the weekend when it’s closed. We could get in and found they sell the usual swag (pens, keychains, clothes, etc.), so we bought some shirts and coffee mugs.</p>

<p>We eventually made it to Los Gatos to our hotel, appropriately named “Hotel Los Gatos”:http://www.jdvhotels.com/hotels/los_gatos/. We had lunch at their Greek (!) restaurant, Deo Deka. This is the best Greek food I’ve had in many many years.</p>

<p>After lunch, we checked into the hotel and took off again for a little drive around Los Gatos and nearby Saratoga. We drove around the area some more before getting Havana to bed and room service for dinner.</p>

          <p>We spent Sunday in San Francisco. We went to “21st Amendment”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/17/21st-amendment-brewpub-review/ for lunch then drove over the Golden Gate Bridge into Marin County and over to Tiburon.</p>

<p>After our little tour of Marin, we went back into the city to our hotel. We relaxed in the hotel room until dinner time. We went downstairs to try the hotel restaurant but they were closed on Sunday. We were too tired to walk around and it was getting late for Havana’s bedtime, so we decided to get room service instead.</p>
