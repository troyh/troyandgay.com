          <p>The DoJ “approved”:http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSWAT00918420080324 the Sirius/XM merger! It’s about “time”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/02/20/siriusxm-merger/! Since we have both Sirius and XM, I can’t wait to see how this affects the service. If nothing else, I hope Sirius’ reception is as good as XM.</p>

          <p>Today is Gay’s birthday. We’re going out to dinner tonight (without Havana) in the big city.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> We were reminded of why the “Washington State Ferry System sucks”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/06/washington-state-ferry-system-sucks/. We waited in the ferry line for an hour because the boats were running late, we missed the first ferry and the next ferry was 20 minutes away (at best). We wouldn’t make it to the restaurant until almost 8pm and we’d have to rush through dinner to catch the 10:15pm ferry or risk hitting the 11:40pm ferry. So we decided to have dinner on the island and go into Seattle sometime this week to make it up. This way, Gay gets two birthday dinners. :)</p>

        <article>
          <p>People hear that Exxon/Mobil made “$40 billion in profit”:http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/01/AR2007020100714.html in 2007 and scream “price-gouging”. Of course, price-gouging is impossible because companies don’t control the price of anything in a free market, supply and demand alone controls prices. Don’t believe it? If they do control prices, why is gas only $4/gallon and not $100/gallon? Answer: because they can’t control the price.</p>

<p>Money Magazine “explains”:http://money.cnn.com/2008/03/13/news/economy/gas_gallon/index.htm?eref=rss_topstories the parts of the price of gas. Here’s how gas prices are broken down:</p>

<p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/blog/pix/2008/03/picture-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>68% of the cost goes to the companies, like Exxon/Mobil, that drill for oil and produce crude oil. Oil can be used to produce “many things you probably use daily”:http://www.thegoodhuman.com/2007/05/25/do-you-know-which-products-are-made-out-of-oil/, not just gasoline. Refineries turn crude oil into gasoline and they get 8%. The distribution companies that deliver the gas to your local gas station also get 8%. The government takes 13%, usually for maintenance of roads. The remaining 3% goes to the gas station that sells you the gas.</p>

<p>Exxon’s $40 billion in 2007 is 10% of their “total revenue of $400 billion”:http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3AXOM. That means that Exxon’s <em>profit margin</em> is 10%, which is healthy, but small compared to Microsoft’s “27% profit margin”:http://finance.google.com/finance?q=msft or Google’s “25% profit margin”:http://finance.google.com/finance?q=goog. Before you complain you pay too much for gas, think about how much you overpaid for the computer you’re using to read this.</p>

<p>Using $4/gallon as an example, $2.72 (68%) of that that is paid to Exxon and their profit is 27¢ on each gallon of gas. Even if Exxon decided to make no profit, a gallon of gas would only drop by 27¢. But if that were to happen, Exxon would have to pack up shop unless they could convince their employees to stay given that their salaries will never increase.</p>

<p>Exxon doesn’t care what the price of a gallon of gas is, they only care about their profit. When the price of anything goes down, people buy more of it (and vice versa). Exxon would be just as happy, if not happier, to make 10% profit on revenue of $800 billion than 10% of their current $400 billion. So lower gas prices are in Exxon’s best interest. So you can be sure that Exxon is going to use the $40 billion to find more oil and find more efficient (cheaper) ways to extract it, which will help to lower prices and increase their profits in the future.</p>

<p>Note: What most people don’t realize about gasoline is that once the gas goes into the pipeline, Exxon (and others) are done. The gas is distributed via trucks to local gas stations and they don’t care what gas station they’re selling the gas to – the same truck delivers gas to several local gas stations. If you think you go to an Exxon-branded gas station and buy oil that Exxon extracted from the ground, you’re wrong. That’s why “stupid ideas”:http://www.snopes.com/politics/gasoline/gasout.asp that have circulated on the internet don’t work.</p>

          <p>We left the hotel in Eugene, Oregon at 8:30am and got home at 1:40pm with just one stop in Lacey, WA for coffee and a diaper-change. Total driving was 2,581 miles.</p>

<p>Havana was a great little traveller, she slept in the car almost on her normal schedule, ate while driving and only cried when she needed her diaper changed, was hungry or was really really bored. Each time we stopped, even 10 minutes was enough to get her out of the car seat and walk her around to look at things and she was happy to go back in the car again.</p>

<p>At the hotels she slept in her “Pack ‘n Play”:http://www.gracobaby.com/productguide/firsttime_playards.aspx just like it was her normal bed. We brought the comforter, bumpers and blankets from her crib so it was just like home. We usually put it in the bathroom where it was dark and almost every night she went to sleep without any problems and slept through the night.</p>

<p>At restaurants she was well-behaved, only a few times squealing with giddyness when she got her food and she made friends with other customers at almost every restaurant. She usually left a mess under her highchair so we always tipped extra well to cover that hassle for the waiter/waitress.</p>

<p>Gas prices seemed pretty normal, the highest we saw was $4.05/gallon for premium in Los Gatos, but we never paid more than $3.80/gallon or less than $3.40/gallon.</p>

<p>A map of the trip:</p>

          <p>The longest day of driving yet. We left Los Gatos Tuesday morning at 8:30am and 570 miles later got to Eugene at 7pm. That’s an average of 54 MPH including stops! Not bad.</p>

<p>We hit traffic almost immediately, routed around it and got to “Vacaville, CA”:http://www.ci.vacaville.ca.us/ before Havana needed a break. Next stop was in “Willows, CA”:http://www.city-data.com/city/Willows-California.html for lunch at Subway and some time in the town playground to give Havana some activity. A diaper-change in “Dunsmuir, CA”:http://ci.dunsmuir.ca.us/n/cod/ and a stop at a rest stop in Oregon were all that were needed to get to Eugene.</p>

<p>After a relaxing dinner again at Steelhead Brewery, we checked into the hotel, watched some TV and went to bed.</p>
