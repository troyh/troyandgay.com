              <p>We took the 9:00a ferry in to see the Monkey Puzzle trees being taken down. We got to the house about 10a and <a href="http://www.bartlett.com/locations/Kenmore-WA.cfm?a">Bartlett Tree Service</a> was about half-done limbing the first tree. By about 1pm the first tree was down to a stump and they were starting the other tree. We left at 2:30p and they thought they’d finish it, but by 5pm they hadn’t. It was limbed and topped, but a 40-foot trunk was still standing and needed to schedule a day to finish it.</p>

<p>We also met with another electrician and another plumber to bid on the project. And the people from <a href="http://www.pacgal.com/">Pacific Galleries</a> came to take some lighting fixtures that we’re going to sell at their auction in November.</p>

<p>The foreman for Bartlett Tree Service made a point of thanking us for hiring them. I assume it’s because of the state of the economy, most people are happy to even have a job these days, but you don’t hear it very often even now. He didn’t have to do it, of course – they do their job, we pay them, it’s a fair trade and we’re both satisfied – but it shows good character (and doesn’t take much). I’m more inclined to hire someone in the future who appreciates the work than someone who doesn’t. Some people we’ve hired over the years behave as if they’re owed a job and that we should be thankful that they’re willing to accept our money.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Today we had a lunch at the house for all the people involved in the house renovation. The architects, interior designers and contractors have worked separately with us as the conduit. Some people hadn’t even met yet. So we wanted to get everyone together at one time, talk and just have a friendly get-together. After a stop for another ultrasound and an OB/GYN appointment, Gay &amp; I picked up cupcakes (a favorite) at Cupcake Royale, beer and sodas at QFC and sandwiches at Volunteer Park Cafe and met everyone at the house.</p>

<p>People who were there: Nancy, My, Jim, Katie, Mark, Doug, Todd and us. Tom had to cancel because his mother had passed-away last week. Besides me, only Todd drank a beer during lunch. I can’t believe I can’t get construction workers to drink beer. This is the third time we’ve brought beer for them and the third time they’ve refused to drink it. Maybe we’ll try white wine spritzers next.</p>

<p>We talked mostly about the stuff the interior designers are working on and walked around the house to talk about some things that Schuchart/Dow is working on. Nancy and Jim agreed with me that the exposed wall in the basement is ugly. Nancy helped us pick out a concrete for the basement from all the samples they did, which was becoming a danger to keeping on schedule.</p>

<p>Eric, the structural engineer, came over later to talk about the stuff he thinks we need to do in the attic. We’d never met him and, except for a couple phone conversations, always talked to him through the architect. It was helpful to finally talk face-to-face with him. We discussed again how we can get rid of the cross-ties in the attic that I don’t like. There’s 2 options: 1) replace every cross-tie with either a steel cable or a steel rod or 2) build 3 trusses with steel beams joining them and put in a ridge beam. The 2nd option may (engineer-speak for “absolutely positively will”) require changes to the lower floors too. Schuchart/Dow will price those options, but I’m guessing we’ll continue with the current plan and keep the cross-ties.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>We went to <a href="http://www.seattlesymphony.org/benaroya/">Benaroya Hall</a> to see <a href="http://www.belleandsebastian.com/home.php">Belle &amp; Sebastian</a> (name taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_and_Sebastian_(TV_series)">a cartoon</a>, not the names of people in the band). We ran into Peter Johnson and his cousin in the lobby, which was a surprise. He said that <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/05/15/reid-marissas-wedding/">Reid and Marissa</a> were also there. I should have expected that. We did see them across the hall once we got into the show and texted Reid to say “Hi”.</p>

<p>It was a good show, although our seats weren’t very good. They played a cross-section of their songs, but with so many albums and EPs they’ve made over the years – they used to be very prolific – a 90-minute show seems short. I’m surprised they didn’t play “Stars of Track and Field”. I like the newer albums but I miss the older songs with the trumpet and horns. I didn’t think to bring the better camera, but at least I took some videos with my iPhone.</p>

<p>I still remember the last time we saw the band. It was <a href="http://www.belleandsebastian.com/tour.php?view=event&amp;event=62">3 days after 9/11 at the Moore Theatre</a>. A bunch of us met down the street for dinner before the show and, of course, talked about 9/11. Belle &amp; Sebastian’s happy music was a nice distraction from it. The band is Scottish and the founder of the band (who shares a birthday with Hudson), wore an American flag shirt and expressed his sympathies. At the time, the world was united against terrorism for the first time in history. It’s amazing how less than a year after that the Bush Administration destroyed any goodwill the rest of the world had for us and squandered the opportunity to bring the world’s armies against terrorism by acting like stupid cowboys bent on re-fighting the Iraq war from 1991.</p>

              <p>We had dinner before the show at <a href="http://www.lecosho.com/">Lecösho</a>, a place we’ve never been. Since we paid for parking at Benaroya Hall, we could walk to the restaurant from the parking garage, just a block west in Harbor Steps. It was a great evening and we caught the end of the sunset from the restaurant.</p>

<p>We had Penn Cove mussels and beef short ribs for appetizers, I had the salmon (of course) for my entree and Gay had the Porchetta, which was stuffed pork wrapped in pig skin cooked slowly for several hours. For dessert, I had an ice cream sandwich, which was a scoop of chocolate ice cream, a scoop of blood orange sorbet and a scoop of corn and cinnamon (!) ice cream sandwiched between two pieces of shortbread. Gay had the chocolate torte. Everything was very good.I had the <a href="http://www.belgianexperts.com/Dupont.php">Saison DuPont farmhouse ale</a> with dinner, which went well with the food.</p>

              <p>Since we were going into Seattle for <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/10/20/belle-sebastian-at-benaroya-hall/">the Belle &amp; Sebastian show</a>, we went to the house to check on progress again. The electrical panel has been moved from the family room area down to the mechanical room below in the basement, the old panel and wall it was on have been removed and both panels are installed in the basement. We saw the west wall of the basement that they grinded to potentially leave it exposed. They put panels showing where the skylights will go in the attic, which helps them figure out where new rafters can go that they structural engineer is demanding but no one understands. The new steel beam for the garage has been delivered and is waiting to be installed. They tested a patch of <a href="http://www.fogcoat.com/">fog coat</a> on the exterior to see how well it covers. We also saw another concrete sample for the basement floor, which we’re still not happy with, and there’s more of those coming in the next few days.</p>
