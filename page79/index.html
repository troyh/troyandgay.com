              <p>Gay’s dad and aunts met us at the hotel restaurant for breakfast before we drove home. We were on the road by 11am, stopped in Ellensburg for lunch and were home on the 4pm ferry. The kids were good the entire drive, as usual, but Havana was sick of her car seat by the time we got the ferry dock and complained about having to get back in it to drive on the ferry. By 4:30 we were watching the 10am Steelers game on the DVR. A good end to a day of long driving.</p>

              <p>Today’s Jimmy &amp; Jessica’s wedding day. We got the kids dressed, went to Costco to get some Champagne and fruit so Gay could make a fruit salad. We fought the Spokane traffic to get to Gay’s dad’s house where Gay assembled the fruit salad. Then we were off to Deer Park to Gay’s mom’s farm for the wedding.</p>

<p>We met Jessica for the first time. The kids found tractors to climb on and some animals to look at before the wedding. The ceremony was short and then we had dinner. We opened a bottle of champagne and tried to share it, but that went over like a lead balloon. It wasn’t a champagne crowd. The kids played with some other kids and danced the night away in the barn.</p>

              <p>We were on our way out of Seattle to Spokane a little after 11am. We got there a little before 4pm and checked into the hotel, <a href="http://www.thedavenporthotel.com/">The Davenport</a>. The Davenport was <em>the</em> hotel in Spokane’s hey-day, went abandoned for many years and was restored about 10 years ago.</p>

<p>Gay’s dad and aunts came to the hotel to meet us and we had cocktails in the lobby restaurant before dinner. We then took a walk around downtown Spokane, happening upon the eve of the grand opening of a new Apple Store. As usual for Apple events, there were a couple guys waiting in line for the 10am opening the next day – Spokane has weirdos who like to wait in line for no reason too. Whodathunkit that Spokane would get an Apple store?!? Either Spokane is growing or Apple is now that mainstream (I think the latter).</p>

<p>We walked to the Davenport Hotel’s newer hotel, The Davenport Tower, which is really just across the street from the original and had dinner there in the Safari Room.</p>

              <p>Gay’s brother is getting married this tomorrow in Spokane. We took the 9am ferry, stopped at <a href="http://www.metamarbleandgranite.com/">Meta Marble</a> to look at some marble samples that the designers like and then we went to the house to check on the progress (after another stop at Top Pot Doughnuts). The master bedroom/bathroom framing is basically done, the kids’ bathroom wall is framed and a new header has been put in place, one of the walls in a kids’ room is re-framed because a door was moving and the plumbers upgraded the 3/4” water line from the street with a 1 1/4” pipe.</p>

              <p>We went back into Seattle today for several things. First, we stopped at Olympic Hot Tub to talk about saunas. There is no other place in Seattle, that I can find, that sells saunas and I wasn’t impressed with Olympic. We want a pre-cut sauna that would be assembled on-site, but I want to buy the heater separately because I want a more efficient <a href="http://www.tylo.com/product.aspx?f_id=23340">Tylö</a> heater. The saleswoman had never heard of Tylö heaters! From what I can tell, that’s like a car salesman never hearing of Mercedes-Benz. They can have a sauna pre-cut kit made, so I asked what kind of wood they’re made out of. She answered “spruce or hemlock”, and seemed surprised that I’d want one made of cedar. Hmm. Before we left, we asked about hot tubs because we’d like to get one eventually. Coincidentally, the “tech guy” came into the showroom and I asked about heating a hot tub with  the boiler in the house, since it’s much more efficient than an electric heater. This is a recommended thing to do if your house has a boiler. The tech guy looked at me like I was a martian. He and the saleswoman said they’d never heard of such a thing! Then the tech guy tried to overwhelm us with jargon. I’d had enough of that place and wanted to get out quickly.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>We stopped at <a href="http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2010/03/23/baguette-on-madison-open-for-lunch">Baguette</a> for some sandwiches and then to <a href="http://www.cupcakeroyale.com/index.html">Cupcake Royale</a> for cupcakes to bring to the house for the lunchtime status meeting with Doug, Mark and Jim from Schuchart/Dow. I brought up the sauna and how hard it is to find a place that sells saunas in Seattle. They recommended just ordering a kit directly from <a href="http://www.finlandiasauna.com/">Finlandia</a> and Jim, saying that they tend to look “too Home Depot” (they do), suggested that we just get the walls from Finlandia and to have the benches built custom. The cost will be about the same but will look much better. The doors on saunas also <a href="http://www.saunaplace.com/saunadoors.html">look either bad or really stupid</a>, so he suggested we get a plain door and they can cut a window into it themselves. And they’d have the HVAC guy talk to us about the hot tub + boiler situation. We talked about the basement ceiling and whether to leave it unfinished or not and whether we should sandblast the pipes or just paint them. Jim had some good ideas on that. Tom suggests leaving them unfinished and we’re inclined to do that, but we’re still concerned about noise transfer to the floor above. We went through all the elevations with them to make sure everything’s clear and, more importantly, possible.</p>

<p>We finished there and then went to Gay’s regular OB/GYN appointment. Everything’s fine with the baby and it was a quick visit. Then we met Lara from NB Design Group at <a href="http://www.annsacks.com/home.jsp">Ann Sacks</a> to look at more tile for the master bath floor. I’m the holdout on picking a floor stone because I didn’t like the small sample I saw or the photo of an installation – it looked like a kid scrawled on it with a crayon. Everyone else (people with better taste than me) likes it, so I need to see the stone in person.</p>

<p>While at Ann Sacks, a long-lost friend Jimmie Steele walked in! Jimmie’s an interior designer living in LA, but has been friends with Eric and Steve for many years. I don’t think we’d seen him in 7 or 8 years. We got quickly caught-up. He’s working in both Seattle and LA and was there with a client of his also looking at tile. He’s considering moving back to Seattle. That’d be great.</p>

<p>On the stone, I like it better than I did from the photo. I’m not entirely convinced it’s the perfect stone, but I’m getting there. The photo I saw that really turned me off was where it was used on the wall rather than the floor, so Lara’s going to try to find some better photos of it in an installation. While I don’t love the stone on its own, it does fit the other surfaces well. And it all depends on which tiles you select and how they’re placed, so I think we’ll end up going to the warehouse and picking and laying-out the tiles ourselves to get the right ones to avoid the crayon-scrawl look.</p>

<p>As usual, we had to hurry to catch a ferry. We called in a pizza order from Zeek’s, picked it up on the way to the ferry and just made it onto the 4pm ferry.</p>
