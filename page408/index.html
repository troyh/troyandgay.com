            <p>I was just talking to a friend at Microsoft about what we used to work on (Outlook). It’s weird, I had trouble even remembering what it was that I did, but I remember thinking it was so critically relevant to the world at the time. And looking back, I feel like anything I did was wasted effort. For example, if you’re an Outlook user, do you know or even care that it repairs itself if a DLL gets deleted accidentally (aka, <a href="http://www.desaware.com/Articles/DllHellL3.htm">“DLL Hell”</a>)? Nope. Without that feature, you’d just reinstall the app like everyone always did. But I spent at least 18 months working on that feature alone and a good couple dozen people across Office worked on it too. I estimate Microsoft spent at least $3 million (20 people, average $100k/yr for 1.5 years) developing that feature. And for what? Our time would have been better spent solving “DLL Hell”, which Microsoft is <a href="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104-991369.html">still trying to do</a>, and/or making installations simpler.</p>

<p>I also worked on Netmeeting integration with Outlook, so you could schedule online meetings. But oh boy, back then Netmeeting was going to end business travel forever. I even have a patent on file for that! Does anyone use it? Nope. In fact, Netmeeting hasn’t been updated by Microsoft since last century. If I mentioned the other work I did, you’d be even less impressed.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today… I’m pretty lucky to have made the jump and started Recipezaar. The personal satisfaction of doing something you love for people who actually use it on a daily basis because they <em>want</em> to use it is what life is all about, for me anyway. My salary isn’t what it was back at Microsoft, but you know, I never much cared about my salary back then anyway. And I don’t dread Mondays anymore, in fact, I often work all weekend. And I enjoy it.</p>

<p>or maybe I just need more coffee.</p>
