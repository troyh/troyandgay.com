          <p>The internet “continues to rise in importance to Americans”:http://news.com.com/Study%3A+Offline+still+beats+online+for+some+activities/2100-1025_3-5307538.html?part=rss&amp;tag=5307538&amp;subj=news.1025.5. 88% say it plays a role in their daily lives, 30% say it plays a “major role”. But what are people looking for online? News? Music? Porn? Recipes? Nope. They want driving directions. :(  Weird, I think I’ve used the internet for driving directions 4 or 5 times in 8 years.</p>

<p>But really, why are we listening to polls to find out what people do on the internet? Can’t computers tell us what people do online?? And would anyone even answer “Porn” when asked what they use the internet for?</p>

          <p>Lots of Google news today… tomorrow “will bring”:http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3394401 their long-awaited and now famous Dutch auction IPO. And for such a well-run company (apparently), they’ve been doing a terrible job with their IPO; first an investigation in an illegal issuing of shares and now they’re being investigated by the SEC for violating the “quiet period” by “granting an interview”:http://news.com.com/Google+revealed+in+Playboy+interview%3F/2100-1038_3-5307955.html?part=rss&amp;tag=5307955&amp;subj=news.1038.5 to Playboy. I just can’t understand why this company is thought to be so valuable. They’re profitable (or so they say) and their search engine doesn’t suck (well, it does, but nobody quite realizes it yet), their Gmail service is not any more interesting than anyone else’s, and to top it all off, they’re really an ad agency. Our favorite ad agency, honestly, but an ad agency nonetheless.</p>
