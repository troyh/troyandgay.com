              <p>Wal-Mart is responsible for getting UPC bar codes into every product sold in the US. I learned this from a <a href="http://securityfocus.com/columnists/169">great article on RFIDs</a>. If you don’t know what an RFID is and you care at all about your privacy, read <a href="http://securityfocus.com/columnists/169">the article</a> because Wal-Mart will also get RFIDs put into every product you buy in the US.</p>

              <p>I could say the govt took <em>way</em> too long to do this, but I won’t. I’m happy that the <a href="http://donotcall.gov">National Do Not Call Registry</a> is up. Now we need a National Do Not Mail Registry.</p>

<p>I’ll also note that this would not have been feasible before the internet – it would have taken an incredible amount of money and marketing to get people to send in paper forms and an incredible amount of money and humans to process the forms. And the telemarketers would have to have published copies of the list, which would take an incredible amount of money to publish and it would  have been constantly out-of-date if it were only published once a year. But thanks to the internet, the cost is very close to $0.</p>

<p>That would be brilliant. A 30GB iPod could hold up to 120 hours (!) of video. And the little <a href="http://apple.com/isight/">iSight</a> and an iPod in your pocket would be much more convenient than a bulky video camera.</p>

              <p>Today I got email (not spam) asking for me to <a href="http://www.maketradefair.com/spage/english/action19.asp?subcat=5&amp;cat=1&amp;select=1&amp;special=yes">sign a petition</a> to help fair trade in Africa, specifically trade of cotton, that would be presented to George W. Bush during his tour through Africa. Then I see the headline <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/27/international/africa/27PREX.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ei=5007&amp;en=401489400387b4e0&amp;ex=1372046400&amp;partner=USERLAND">Bush Calls for Changes in Africa to End Wars and Promote Trade</a> and I think that finally I can say something positive about Bush again. But the article ends:</p>

<p>_Mr. Bush did not specify whether he would support trade policy changes in the United States that many African leaders say are vital to the economic development of their countries. Among them are allowing textile imports, which are effectively barred under current legislation, and cutting subsidies to American farmers on crops also grown in Africa, especially cotton. _</p>

<p>Oh well.</p>
