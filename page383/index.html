            <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/ipod.jpg" alt="ipod.jpg" />My new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> arrived last week.  Got a most excellent deal on the 30gig version from dell, though <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/05/001428.php">it took like a month to get here</a>.  I’ve experienced the same problems others have with hangs and resets running with it in the clip, but only rarely now that i run with it in my hand.  I’m now on a cd burning spree and rediscovering old music.  I’ve got 12gigs/2959 songs so far.  I can’t begin to express how interesting it is to listen to music that entered my collection 10-15 years ago (too bad kevin doesn’t have a blog for me to link to his dissertation on this), though I’m sure there are blog entries to come about certain bands – I’m only up to the Cs in my ripping.  One thing i did want to mention is the utter beauty of this device.  I thought Troy’s 5gig iPod was cool when he got it last year, but this is lighter, smaller and just amazing to control with the heat-sensitive buttons and circular trackpad.  I’m surprised Troy hasn’t posted the photos of us unpacking it.  Now we just need to <a href="http://gallery.ipodlounge.com/index.php">post a photo of gPod on Vashon</a></p>

            <p>What I learned today: Unix admins are <em>still</em> <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/russkiypenguin/52206.html">arrogant jerks</a>.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Got a most hilarious email from a Recipezaar member today.  We rejected a recipe they posted because (as they themselves stated in the description) it was an exact copy of a recipe already published on the site with a few amounts included so the nutritional analysis could be more accurate.  We, of course, don’t like having duplicate recipes because it is more work for us (duh); and, more importantly, the people that post the original recipes certainly don’t like having their recipes copied.  We have a way for anyone to submit corrections to an already posted recipe, and asked that this person submit a correction instead – that way everyone benefits.  To this they said <em>“Uhm, fuck you. I am a unix sys admin…your letter is demeaning and nasty…But whoever the dumbass is that you hired and allowed “bread” to be entered without the amount on a few sandwiches is a fucking dumbass. And most important of all, your email response to my entry is one of the most fucking insulting emails I’ve ever been sent. I’m serious….”</em>  I’d love to print the whole thing here so you can judge for yourself, but I don’t have to: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/russkiypenguin/52206.html">they posted about their “response to Recipezaar.com being a dumbass” in their blog too</a> where you can comment back to them.  And to quote this person: “All I have to say is the same thing.”</p>

            <p>Has there ever been a more annoying band than <a href="http://www.whitestripes.com/main.html">The White Stripes</a>?! This band gets no end of praise these days (which usually means they’re on their way out already…good!) but never have I heard a band’s (and I use the term “band” loosely, they don’t even have a bassist) song come on the radio that makes me mute the radio so consistently. Nails on a blackboard.</p>
