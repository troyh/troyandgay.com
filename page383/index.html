          </h3>
            <p>We watched <a href="http://www.aboutschmidtmovie.com/">About Schmidt</a> last night. Jack Nicholson plays a retired insurance salesman (you know what that means) who realizes that he was a less-than-perfect husband and father to his daughter. Jack Nicholson plays the role perfectly as a guy coming to grips with retirement and the realization that his life wasn’t very meaningful. Trying to create a meaningful life, he adopts an orphaned boy from in Africa through one of those television charities. The movie is narrated by his letters to his foster child as he expresses his feelings about his life as he travels  around the midwest in his Winnebago after his wife suddenly dies.</p>

<p>It’s one of the best movies I’ve seen in years. You feel sorry for him, it makes you reflect on your own life (it did to me, anyway), and it’s very funny as well. At one point, he goes to see the house he was born in and finds a tire store in its place. Seeing Jack Nicholson walk into the tire store as he envisions his old house is brilliant, and then tells the sales clerk “You won’t believe this, but we had a tire swing right here”. Funny.</p>

<p>Howard Hesseman and Kathy Bates bicker as divorced parents of Dermot Mulroney (who has hair as good as the best I remember from the 80s), their waterbed salesman son who is marrying Schmidt’s daughter while trying to get his new business (“Everyone thinks it’s a pyramid scheme, but it’s not”) started.</p>

            <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/apple.gif" alt="apple.gif" />Ok, we’re set. Apple will be showing the <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/wwdc03/">WWDC 2003 Keynote</a> online, albeit delayed. Watching Steve Jobs’ keynotes are some of the most interesting events in the computer industry. Bill Gates gets high marks for his keynotes too, but he’s just too stiff and never demos anything himself; he just hovers over an underling and asks softball questions. Steve Jobs is a master at it, though, and he never disappoints. He gets you interested, keeps you interested and makes you realize that the only exciting company in the industry is Apple. And I just love that he demos everything himself and does it so well.</p>

<p>Sounds like we can expect lots of OS X 10.3 Panther talk and even a new PowerMac G5 which uses the IBM PowerPC 970, a 64-bit CPU. Apple will, once again, leap-frog the industry by being the first to ship a 64-bit CPU to the masses. 64-bit CPUs aren’t going to be useful for a couple more years yet (it took at least 5 years for 32-bit CPUs to become the norm after they were available) but it’s nice to see it down the road.</p>

            <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/tux.gif" alt="tux.gif" />Linux + open source + Google=free fast tech support! Last night, the machine that runs this site seemed to die – I couldn’t ssh into it. Our machines are in downtown Seattle and this machine isn’t critical to anything, so I ignored it and went to bed. This morning, I called our hosting company and they looked at it and it appeared to be crashed. This is odd, because Linux never ever crashes (in 3 years of running 15 linux servers 24x7 I’ve seen 1 crash and it was due to a defective RAM chip). So they rebooted it for me.</p>

<p>I could get into it again, checked the logs, found the error that caused it to crash, searched for that text on Google and voilá, <a href="http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2002-085.html">I know what the problem is</a>. Total time: about 12 seconds. I could have it fixed even within the  hour if I felt like it was serious enough to worry about before the weekend.</p>

<p>If I didn’t use Linux, I’d spend hours just trying to figure out what the error message means exactly. And if the vendor didn’t have a fix available (if they deemed it important enough to fix, that is), I’d have to wait months or even years for a fix, if it ever came.</p>
