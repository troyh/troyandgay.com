          <p>Had to run into Seattle this morning. My SIM in my cell phone mysteriously died. Nobody can tell me why SIMs suddenly die, but T-Mobile confirms they do. Dropped Gay’s car off at the shop to fix a couple recalls we never got around to having done. Lunch at Elliot Bay Brewery, then picked up some new CDs: <a href="http://www.radiohead.com/">Radiohead</a>’s <em>Hail To The Thief</em>, <a href="http://www.grandaddylandscape.com/">Grandaddy</a>’s <em>Sumday</em> and <a href="http://www.yolatengo.net/">Yo La Tengo</a>’s <em>Summer Sun</em> before hopping on the ferry home.</p>

          <p>Just finished <a href="http://www.transportermovie.com/home.html">The Transporter</a>, an action movie with the guy from <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&amp;cf=info&amp;id=1800023087">Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</a> (which I loved) and <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/movies/reviews/movie/386066">Snatch</a>. The plot is pretty undeveloped and oddly unexplained, but the point of the movie is the action – which is pretty good. The initial driving scene is great (in a BMW 735!) then his choice of cars plummets throughout the movie as does the action in the car scenes. Lots of fight scenes, mostly typical, but there’s a cool fight scene in oil and uses parts of a bike pretty well. Overall, entertaining but I was glad it was only 92 minutes.</p>

<p>Tomorrow night’s movie is <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/XXX-1112845/reviews.php">XXX</a>, which promises to be the dumbest movie  since the last Steven Seagal movie.</p>

          <p>In today’s time trial, Lance Armstrong <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=ap-dauphinelibere&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns">took the lead</a> in the <a href="http://www.dauphine-libere.com/">Dauphiné-Libéré</a> race today. He beat David Millar by a minute even! The race ends on Sunday, but Lance is demonstrating that he’s in good form for the Tour in July.</p>

          <p>We watched <a href="http://www.k19movie.com/">K19: The Widowmaker</a> last night. It’s a true story about a Soviet nuclear submarine in 1961 that had problems with the nuclear reactor powering the sub on its maiden voyage intended to strike fear in the hearts of America with the Soviet’s nuclear power and strike potential.</p>

<p>It was intended to be very suspenseful, but it wasn’t. This was probably because we know that nothing nuclear happened in 1961 off the coast of the US so we assume that everything was resolved satisfactorily. Harrison Ford’s Russian accent was kinda weak and faded in and out at times and Liam Neeson’s Russian accent didn’t exist, making it even harder to believe. And, of course, there’s a lot of “Communists are cold and heartless people bent on the destruction of the US” rhetoric typical of Hollywood cold war movies.</p>

We have a caterpillar infestation! These things create nests in our trees, then crawl out and devour the leaves on the trees, not to mention crawling all over the driveway, patio, furniture, house, etc. Then they go and make coccoons where they morph into moths that are sure to make our summer nights miserable. Then the moths lay eggs to repeat the process ten-fold next year.</p>

<p>We don’t want this to happen. We’ve been spraying <a href="http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/2000/2174.html">B.t.</a> all over the trees to try to kill them. I think we are making some progress, but it’s not going to be a fun couple weeks.</p>

<p>Aside from this, the weather’s been great in Seattle. It even hit 91º on Friday. We spent almost the entire weekend outdoors doing yardwork. I even climbed up on the roof and vacuumed out the gutters with <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/05/001435.php">my new blower/vac</a>.</p>
