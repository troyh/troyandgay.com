        <article>
          <p>Today Hudson turned 3. He still loves dinosaurs, cars, trucks and now tools. He’s played with my tools so much that we got him a toy power tool set for his birthday that he likes to use. He’s become his own person in the last year, no longer just following Havana around and doing what she says but playing on his own and making his own decisions. Like his dad, he’s not very social and is usually very happy to play by himself. His vocabulary has improved quite a bit in the last year and his enunciation has also improved. He’s surprisingly good at putting puzzles together, although mostly goes by shape than the picture on the pieces, which impresses me.</p>

<p>He went to preschool on Vashon and when we moved to Seattle, he went to his own summer preschool at <a href="http://www.savvysource.com/preschools/washington/seattle/sh2502-nannys-preschool">Nanny’s Preschool</a> for a few weeks this summer and really loved that. He’ll go there this fall too.</p>

<p>He still takes afternoon naps usually and is very cranky in the evening if he doesn’t have it. He sleeps very well, although wakes up in a dream a few times a month crying out and needing us to come in and calm him down. He can sleep anywhere and in the most uncomfortable positions – when he’s tired he just conks out wherever he happens to be, usually with his thumb in his mouth.</p>

<p>He’s still not potty-trained, although he knows how to do it, he simply prefers using the diaper. He’s right that it’s more convenient for him, but doesn’t seem to care that it’s less convenient for us. He can practically change his own diaper, I think we might have more luck encouraging that.</p>

          <p>Eva is 8 months old today. She scoots around on the floor pretty well these days, not up on her knees crawling around, but she’s quick nonetheless. She can feed herself finger food and like Havana and Hudson, loves <a href="http://www.mummums.com/">Mum Mums</a>. She is just starting to learn to wave goodbye.</p>

<p>Eric happened to be in town from New York and spent a couple nights with us.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>We’ve been waiting for weeks for the door pulls to be built. We had 12th Ave Iron make one for the pantry door and Twisted Metalworks made four for the attic doors. We used the same design for all of them, but wanted to see how different the two companies would make them. They both had another company bend the steel into a ‘Z’ to make the shape and that company had some problems doing it, so that delayed it. Twisted finished one first but made it 1/16” too narrow for the 3” doors, so they had to remake it. They delivered them and they were nice, but all a bit twisted, so Kurt had some trouble cutting the hole in the doors to get them to fit. Those were all installed last week.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/6070588129/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6190/6070588129_7c77ebee6e.jpg" alt="Door pull" /></a></p>

<p>12th Ave delivered theirs and, as expected, was much more square and a little more refined. Very nice. Tim and Kurt had an easier time installing it in the pantry door. Now that the pull was in place, they could template for the cladding on the lower half of the door and then cut those sheets. Those were installed today along with the side panels, so the door now looks like one big heavy block of steel with Frankenstein-like fasteners across the face. We really like how it turned out.</p>

<p>12th Ave also installed the track for the master bathroom sliding door (I can do a pull-up on it!). The glass for that was templates and ordered, so as soon as that arrives they can mount it to the wheels and install it. Hopefully that will come soon after our replacement toilet arrives – after some fighting with the retailer, Toto offered to send us a replacement porcelain bowl for free (a $1500 item!) and we could just switch out the electronics from the broken one. I hope they actually come through and send it!</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>The forms came off the concrete walls last week and every day that I looked at them I was worried that they didn’t fit the house the way we wanted them to. I kept it to myself all week but couldn’t get over it. The original plan for the decks, as designed by the architects, was to have them both cantilever out from the house, as if they were floating.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The building code dictates that a person is only allowed to fall 30 inches (a magic number for injuries, I guess), so if a platform is more than 30 inches a guard rail is required to keep people from falling. We didn’t want guard rails because they’re ugly. Tom Kundig suggested putting concrete planters – boxes containing dirt with plants or trees in them – around the deck because he, who doesn’t like guard rails either, knows this gets around the building code. Apparently, falling 30 inches is okay if you hit something on your way down. So before we hired a landscape architect, the plan was to  have two decks on a single plane surrounded by concrete planters. Simple enough.</p>

<p>Months later, we hired a landscape architect and he made some changes to that design. He lengthened the south deck and, instead of a single plane, made it drop by two steps to a sitting area and then another two steps to the original grade where our dining area would be. We loved the changes, but ran them by Tom Kundig to double-check and he liked it better than his own design. So we had been set to go forward with the design as soon as the house interior was complete and we were moved in.</p>

<p>The concrete forms were built a few weeks ago and the concrete was poured. The forms were eventually removed and the walls looked great. But I had a nagging feeling that they were “too much”. We always talked about how the house should be like <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=2001+a+space+odyssey&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;prmd=ivnsb&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TNdSTrzYOKPniAKf-PTnDA&amp;ved=0CHAQsAQ&amp;biw=1068&amp;bih=1066">some of the sets in 2001: A Space Oddysey</a> – a mix of modern and traditional that work together. And I love how <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=the+louvre+paris&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;prmd=ivnsm&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=z9ZSTsWdA-rSiAKymIjtDA&amp;ved=0CEAQsAQ&amp;biw=1068&amp;bih=1066">I.M. Pei’s addition to the Louvre</a> in Paris is super modern but complements the old building behind it. I was scared we went too far.</p>

<p>Despite the reassurances from everyone that it will work when it’s all done, I had us all going through ideas to modify the walls and even take them out completely and start over. This put the plans on hold to build the south deck, so I was very conscious of how quickly I had to get this straight in my head.</p>

<p>Our interior designer told me that the problem I see is that the deck wasn’t in yet so the walls looked a lot bigger than they will eventually appear. That was true. Scott, the landscape architect, assured me that it continues the changes we made in the kitchen and family room and to the outside, which is what we asked for. Jim Dow came over and said that he likes it, that it does fit the big blocky buttresses of the house and encouraged me to continue to “be bold”. I thought about it more over the weekend and then we had Todd from Olson Kundig come over to take a look and take photos to show Tom. Todd said the same thing, that it does work and we should continue. He then talked to Tom and Tom agreed. At that point, with people a lot smarter than me telling me I’m wrong, who am I to argue? It wouldn’t be the first or last time I’m wrong, but usually when I feel this uncomfortable about something, I discover that I was right to be uncomfortable. I’m still  not convinced, but we’re going ahead with the plan and I’m continuing to spend a lot of time staring at it trying to see the vision. Boy, I hope I’m wrong.</p>

          <p>We delivered gifts of wine and chocolate to neighbors whose property adjoins ours to thank them for putting up with construction for the last year and to apologize in advance for the noise coming tomorrow.</p>

<p>We met some new people. 2 people grew up in the DC area, 1 lives there half the year (all agreed it sucks!). We learned that Molly Moon herself, of <a href="http://www.mollymoonicecream.com/ice-cream-shops">Molly Moon</a> ice cream, lives on the next block. And while Gay was picking up the chocolate from the corporate office of <a href="http://www.franschocolates.com/store/home.php?xid=1ef6fecd8fb7a4bf75f32320e0469053">Fran’s Chocolate</a> this afternoon, learned some things while talking to Dylan, Fran’s son who she went to college with and who works at the company: Fran lives on the next block too so Dylan grew up in our neighborhood, her husband worked with the previous owner of this house many years ago, and Dylan remembered going trick-or-treating at our house as a kid. Small world.</p>
