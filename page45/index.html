          </h3>
            <p>Hudson had his tonsils and adenoids out this morning. That’s a Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy, what the doctors refer to as a “T&amp;A”. You’d think doctors would know that abbreviation.</p>

<p>He couldn’t eat any breakfast do he wasn’t happy. We checked in at 8:45a and he was given anesthesia at 9:55a. Surgery was over by 10:25a and we could see him at 10:50a.</p>

<p>He wasn’t feeling well but fell asleep in Gay’s arms after 15 minutes after being given pain-killers.</p>

<p>He was hooked up to a monitor that checked his heart rate and the oxygen in his blood. When he slept, it dropped low enough once that they wanted him to spend the night in the hospital.</p>

<p>An ambulance took him 2 blocks to Swedish hospital and we were in his room by 1:30p. We could have walked faster. This ambulance episode showed how bad our medical services are. The medic, trying to make conversation, told Gay that he’s “never had tonsils”. What kind of training do EMTs get that they don’t know that everyone has tonsils?</p>

<p>Kelly brought Havana, Eva and a night bag for Gay at 4:30p and I went home with them, leaving Gay to spend the night with him.</p>

<p>While at the hospital, his oxygen level was 97+%, which is normal, even while sleeping. So we think the anesthesiologist at the clinic over-reacted by recommending a night in the hospital. But it’s better to be safe than sorry. And apparently, unnecessary medical care is better for doctors to avoid potential lawsuits.</p>

<p><strong>11/4 Update:</strong> We got the bill. It cost $1,654.60 for the ambulance ride (we have to pay $300 of that). It’s amazing how much money our healthcare system wastes. The only thing dumber than this are the people who don’t think it needs an overhaul.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>I agree with <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/dannywestneat/2016474631_danny12.html">Danny Westneat</a>, Occupy Wall Street assigns blame to someone else for all the problems of the world:</p>

<blockquote>But are we 99 percenters going to blame it all on them? Did no one in the 99 percent lie on their liar loans? Or buy way too much house? Rack up too much debt on flat screens or second homes? Fall for those political sweet nothings that said no matter how much the country spends, you won't have to pay for it?</blockquote>

<p>The “Occupy Wall Street” people are bad at math and ignorant about democracy and history. They’re the left-wing’s Tea Party.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>They think the government is controlled by “corporate greed” and “corrupt politics”. I feel like I’m back in high school listening to some jackass sitting in the back of his pickup truck pouring beer into his head and talking about how the world would be better if he were in charge.</p>

<p>Corporations make money and they make your lives better. Before corporations, people lived in poverty and had short life expectancies. These protesters need a lesson in history.</p>

<p>And I want corporations to outsource work to other countries (the other 95% of the world’s population) so those people can prosper and they too can create corporations that work every day to make my life better.</p>

<p>Corruption in politics? Corruption in politics is illegal and has been prosecuted many times in the US. If you have proof of corruption, let’s see it and have those politicians arrested and prosecuted. Sitting in your sleeping bag (made by a greedy corporation) on the sidewalk is not going to do it.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, they’re not exactly like the Tea Partyers. The Tea Party people actually got off their asses and did something. These people just want to self-righteously whine until the problems are solved by someone else.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We finally made it to Elysian’s pumpkin beer festival this year.  I love pumpkin beers, it’s one of my favorite styles so I’ve been looking forward to it since <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2010/10/16/4514/">I missed it again last year</a>. This year they had it at their new (huge) brewery in Georgetown and they sold tickets so we were guaranteed to get in. The place was packed, it was more of a Waiting In Line Festival that served beer. As soon as you got your beer you had to get back in another line to get your next one because the lines were so long and slow-moving. We got a lot of great beers that we wouldn’t have been able to get otherwise, so it was worth it. And there weren’t as many yokels just there to get drunk, which plague most beer festivals. </p>

<p>Mo worked Saturday and watched the kids so we could go. We used Uber to get there and back to avoid drinking and driving and met up with Jon and Megan. We all came back to our house for BBQ dinner.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>I’m sad that Steve Jobs died today. Steve Jobs, among a couple others in the early days of personal computers, inspired me as a kid to make software and, hopefully, one day create my own software business. His entrepreneurial story in the late 1970s, building a computer in a garage and selling it, amazed me. Until then, to me, giant corporations were the only ones who could make things. He made me think anyone, maybe even me, could do something like that. As a kid learning to program a computer, I dreamed that one day I’d make software that was used by millions of people. </p>

<p>Apple made great products when he was there and lousy products when he wasn’t. I never had an Apple product until Jobs returned to Apple. But I always wanted one and remember the day my dad took me to a local computer store (The Math Box in Fairfax, Virginia) where I played with the original Macintosh. I never even touched a NeXT Cube, Jobs’ second company, but always wanted one. I remember watching clips of Jobs introducing it on late night news when I was in college working as a night security guard. When Apple bought NeXT in 1997 and released beta versions of Mac OS X, which was really the NeXT operating system, in 1999 I bought a PowerMac G4 on eBay just to play with it. Soon I was a convert and have been a Mac user ever since. I bought the first iPod in 2001, several more since then, the iPhones and iPads.</p>

<p>Thank you, Steve. </p>

<p>He was only 56 years old. I try to remind myself often that time is your most valuable resource – not only is it limited, but you don’t even know how much of it you have.</p>

<p>Time to re-watch <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2005/06/15/steve-jobs-stanford-commencement-speech/">his Stanford University commencement speech</a>.</p>
