          <p>I’ve been cycling on a more regular schedule than any time that I’ve lived in Seattle. But I can feel my age now…. when I was 25 I could feel myself getting stronger at least once a week. At 33 years old, I feel like my leg strength has stagnated; the same hills tire my legs out the same everyday. I hate to think what it’ll be like at 40.</p>

          <p>At the end of last week, we rolled out a bunch of <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/">new forums in our Community Talk area</a> on Recipezaar.  Wish we didn’t need it, but glad to institute <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewforum.zsp?f=17">The Frying Pan</a> forum, which is where we will move all the topics that just get too hot, where “all the dead horses go to be beat.”</p>

          <p>_Your (or whoever’s) website is full of misspelled words and bad grammar.  For starters “zaar” is spelled either “czar” or “tzar” but never “zaar”.
Just a friendly suggestion that you have someone proofread what goes on your website, preferably someone whose spelling and grammar knowledge you can trust.  It is much more professional that way.  _</p>

<p>For starters, did you really think we misspelled our LOGO?  Do your friends ever call you “Mo”, Maureen?</p>

<p>I’ve been laughing at this one all day….</p>

          <p>My dad and his two sisters (who are all retired and all live TOGETHER in Spokane) are coming for a visit this weekend.  Last time dad was here, he brought his own food, which he kept in his own refrigerator, so we only ate a couple of meals together.  He also arrived on one day’s notice and didn’t provide a definite departure date.  As you can imagine, this did not make him the most favored house guest of 2002.  I have addressed these issues with him, so I’m hoping we will have a much better visit this time.  But WHY must people over the age of 62 eat dinner before 4:30?  Does not working make you hungrier earlier?
<!-- more -->
One of dad’s oft-quoted lines from the last visit was when he told Troy and I to “never have kids, dogs are better.”</p>

<p>I tried to explain that “dogs don’t go to college and get good jobs that afford them the ability to buy nice houses where parents can come and enjoy a visit…”</p>

          <p>I think Troy glossed over this whole neighbor dispute a bit…  I mean these folks did just decide to make a paved parking space on our property without so much as asking.  When we called them on it, they did not even apologize.  These are the same folks who have been quick to ask for other help from us in the past, and have made several requests regarding just this spot of land previously, so claims of ignorance hold no water.  Not only could we be fined for their malfeasance, we could have blocked their project or worse, sued.  We opted to do what is right for the neighbors that use the road (provide the pullout) and what is right for the slope (get the advice of a geotech and put up retaining wall at our expense).  After a week of tense conversations, they did finally patch things up a bit and we are splitting the cost of the $240 ecology blocks.  I really still can’t believe their nerve, but clearly they didn’t want to be in a “favor debt” with us or something.  This whole situation really ate me up for a week and caused several sleepless nights.</p>
