          <p>Gay went to Seattle yesterday and stayed overnight to help with a friend’s baby shower. I stayed home with the dogs and had a pretty relaxing day (working, but fun &amp; relaxing).</p>

<p>Had a delicious salmon dinner and some white wine. No movies tonight, two stages of the Giro d’Italia, <em>60 Minutes</em> and <em>Sopranos</em>.</p>

          <p>We’re on a movie kick – 3 movies in 3 days. That’s more movies than we’ve seen in the previous 3 months.</p>

<p>Last night, we watched Todd Haynes’ <a href="http://www.farfromheavenmovie.com/">Far From Heaven</a>. It was set in 1957 and just like <em>Catch Me If You Can</em>, the set design felt like the period. The movie was good – it was nominated for 4 Academy Awards, after all. It was filmed in the tradition of the movies at the time, apparently mimicking <a href="http://entertainment.msn.com/celebs/celeb.aspx?mp=b&amp;c=135093">Douglas Sirk</a>’s style. It’s interesting to see how far the US has come on racism, interracial relationships and homosexuality (“Oh! That word!”). Nobody minded if she (<a href="http://www.julianne-moore.com/">Julianne Moore</a>) was seen talking to her black female housekeeper but everyone was “in a clamor” when she talked with her black male gardener. And her husband who was gay went to a psychologist who suggested medication and electro-shock therapy to “cure” him. The US has a <em>long</em> way to go still on these issues, but in just 40 years (2 generations) the difference is surprising. Or maybe the US is just less blatant about its prejudices.</p>

<p>The other thing that I find interesting about movies that this movie imitated is how they portray the “perfect life”, the “perfect family”, etc. The innocence is appealing, I admit, but nobody truly lived like that then and they don’t now either. Even watching <em><a href="http://www.timvp.com/beaver.html">Leave It To Beaver</a></em> reruns as a kid I knew it was all fake. But I’m not so sure most people do and Hollywood unknowingly set the impossible standard for Americans. Martha Stewart, to me, is the modern equivalent. Image sells and reality doesn’t, I guess.</p>

          <p>We talked again with our neighbors and things are better. No more animosity on either side, I think.</p>

          <p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/2934122.stm">Annika Sorenstam didn’t make the cut</a> at the PGA. I imagine there are some gloating golfers right now. But at least she beat a few men.</p>

          <p>We just resolved an issue with our neighbors that dragged on for over a week. We live on a steep slope (flagged by the county as a “sensitive area”) that has a history of landslides and our neighbors live down the slope. A road winds down the slope to their house that they decided to pave. Unfortunately, they decided to make a large cut into the slope for a car pull-over which weakened the slope. We hired a “geotech” to look at the change and he advised us to reinforce the hill. No problem; the neighbors get a convenient pull-over and a reinforcement will make it safe for everyone. Everyone’s happy, right?</p>

<p>But our neighbors were difficult about the problem they created, were reluctant to work with us to solve it and, in a passive-aggressive way, implied that we are simply worried about property lines (the cut-out was on our property), then they claimed it was their property (although they have asked us several time to trim the trees on the property when they obstruct the roadway) and threatened to have it surveyed and wanted us to pay for that. So to end it, we just decided to pay to fix the problem (that we didn’t cause).</p>

<p>You move out to a rural area and make the assumption that people are generally more friendly than in the city. But jerks live everywhere. I wonder if karma really exists.</p>
