            <p><a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2083760/">Wither the Weapons?</a>.  We were sold the Iraq war on the basis that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.  So where are they?  Either they won’t be found because they don’t exist (not since 95 when we destroyed them the last time around) or because, as some are incredulously arguing now, the Iraqis destroyed them.  The latter proves only the threat of war was necessary to get Saddam to disarm; while the former proves we either shouldn’t have gone to war, or the American people were persuaded on a lie.  If the peace movement wants to succeed in the future, their greatest task is ahead of them now.  DO NOT SHUT UP UNTIL THE WEAPONS ARE FOUND.</p>

            <p>Yep, we did have an earthquake. <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/recenteqsUS/Quakes/uw05300350.htm">A 3.4 near Port Orchard, WA</a>. Lots of <a href="http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/shake/STORE/X5300350/ciim_stats_1.html">reports</a> already, 6 even from Vashon. This is the 4th quake I’ve felt since living in Seattle: 2 tiny (including this one), 1 small and 1 HUGE.</p>

            <p>Salon did <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/05/29/tax_cuts/">an article</a> listing the things that the $330 billion tax cut Bush just signed into law would have bought instead. The list includes providing health care for the 41.2 million Americans who don’t have health care, hired 100,000 teachers and provided aid to 6,000 schools and tutoring for 9 million low-income children, and countless other causes more worthy than giving the average citizen a couple hundred bucks or wealthy people even more money than they need. Gotta love the wisdom of government.</p>
