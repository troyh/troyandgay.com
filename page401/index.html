            <p>A funny thing happened on the way to the game….. we were driving down the West Seattle Bridge and Gay, who was driving, took the wrong exit. So while on the exit ramp, she decided she was going to get back into traffic and take the next (correct) exit instead. There was a median in the way, but Gay didn’t see it. She took the median at 50+ MPH, then realized when the car was straddling the median that the median was there. She went all the way over the median and decided to stop on the bridge (actually at my suggestion that she not enter 60MPH traffic from a near stop). We eventually made the correct exit and I’m glad to have survived and I’m glad the car did too (as far as we know).</p>

<p>I think I’ll be driving from now on. If I die in a car accident, it’s going to be <strong>my</strong> fault.</p>

            <p>I’ve always thought that software companies were living on borrowed times by being protected from lawsuits due to defects in their products. Now, a South Korean group <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,1054790,00.asp">is suing</a> Microsoft for the SQL Slammer virus. This was a bad one across Asia and even impacted Recipezaar due to other servers on the subnetwork we’re on using MS SQL Server. I think the biggest effect on software in the next decade will be retraction of the EULA agreements we all agree to when we open the package. If Ford can be sued for damages in their defective products, why can’t a software company?</p>

Appropriately the dirty bomb is scheduled to go off at the the Tully’s coffee roasting plant (mwhahaha).  I sort of wish I could volunteer to be a victim/actor – it is as close as I hope to be to a real attack, but it would be interesting to see how it all goes down.</p>

            <p>Watched a very moving <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/burden/">Frontline</a> on <a href="http://www.pbs.org">PBS</a> (which is by far the most interactive media company) which dealt with the burdens faced by those that have been released from prison as a result of DNA testing.   I can’t even fathom 10 or 20 or more years in prison when you are innocent of the crime.  Only 17 states have some type of retribution laws (not Washington) and the federal max is $5,000.  I’m giving to <a href="http://www.innocenceproject.org/">The Innocence Project</a> this year.</p>
