            <p>Unlike the rest of the world, I was not excited about seeing the 2nd Matrix movie. The first one was okay. I wasn’t expecting much (why would I? Keanu Reeves is in it) but was impressed by the innovative special effects. The plot is a re-hash of every Philosophy 101 course (is the world really just our imagination?) so my brain wasn’t twisted inside-out trying to comprehend the concept. But the effects sure were cool, so I figured Matrix Reloaded would be more of the same.</p>

<p>A friend did go see it and wasn’t impressed. Now I find this <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/5/15/22352/6060">review</a>: _ I will attempt to describe how suckrageous this movie was without revealing any spoilers or major plot points, though this might be difficult._</p>

<p>Maybe I’ll just wait for the DVD.</p>

            <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/mcadoo.jpg" alt="mcadoo.jpg" />Steve and his 2 dogs visited for the last time, at least for a while. He quit his job at <a href="http://real.com">Real Networks</a> and is starting a new life in <a href="http://www.austin-chamber.org/">Austin</a>, Texas in June.</p>

<p>This morning, Ouzo and Steve’s dog, Rose, got in a fight over breakfast. I stupidly fed our dogs without separating the other two dogs and Rose wanted to share Ouzo’s food. Ouzo’s usually so nice but he went nuts and attacked Rose. It was a struggle to pull them apart. Scary.</p>

It’s <a href="http://www.biketoworkday.org/Education/bike_to_work.cfm">Bike To Work Day</a> and I just got back from a bike ride. Our friend Steve is coming over tonight before he moves to Austin, Texas. I’m working on a really fun new thing for the site. Life is good.</p>

            <p>And I missed the <a href="http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/extra/TLE2003May15.html">total lunar eclipse</a> tonight. We caught the last few minutes of it, but we had a very clear view of the moon and still missed it.</p>
