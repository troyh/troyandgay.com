            <p>Maybe <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/30621.html">this</a> is the reason Google bought Blogger. Separating weblog content from their main index is good, I think, but how will Google know which sites are weblogs and which aren’t?</p>

            <p>On Friday, the Benders and another Vashon friend, Carol Eggen, came over for dinner (barbequed hamburgers).</p>

<p>On Saturday, we skipped our plans to go the <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/bellevuesquare/">new Apple Store</a>, the first in Seattle. Instead, we worked most of the day, as usual. :(  But we at least took advantage of the great weather and spent a good amount of time outdoors playing with the dogs and just relaxing.</p>

<p>I’m going to make a serious effort to get my weekends back. :)</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Saw <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/wallstreet/">The Wall Street Fix</a> on <a href="http://pbs.org">PBS</a> last night about the WorldCom debacle. Based on that, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2002/04/25/pf/investing/grubman/">Jack Grubman</a> was the slime ball behind it all, Bernard Ebbers was just the figurehead, and even Alan Greenspan doesn’t come out looking so good (he let Travelers Insurance and Citibank bend the rules to do an illegal merger which made the financing of Worldcom possible). It ended with tiny penalties to the people involved. Jack Grubman was fined less than one year’s salary and was fired from his job, but given a $30 million severance package (which was 2x his penalty). “Steal $5 and you’re a thief, steal $5 million and your a financier”.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/">Eliot Spitzer</a> let these guys get away with serious crimes, but it’s hard to fault him. He did more than anyone else did, but was unlikely to have a significant victory in a prolonged trial against well-financed lawyers. And the Bush Administration doesn’t have a great track record of enforcing laws against wealthy people and corporations. It’ll be interesting to see what happens to the Enron and Worldcom execs on trial by the SEC.</p>

            <p>Went out to dinner with Gary (Nancy’s in Seattle visiting her dad). Gary also removed the one stripped screw in my iBook so now I can finally open it up and fix the screen (I hope!).</p>

            <p>Gay’s <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/05/001396.php#001396">post</a> about innocent people being released from prison reminded me about the show. Imagine going to jail for something you didn’t do in your early 20s and getting out in your 40s and you get $0 to get off your feet, you can’t get a job because employers don’t understand the meaning of “innocent”, you’ve been living with criminals in prison with few rules for now most of your life and have a hard time adapting to society’s rules. And why do you end up this way? Because you didn’t do anything! Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/OJ/daily/9511/11-15/simpson_golf_cap.gif">OJ Simpson is playing golf</a> and the Enron &amp; Worldcom execs who swindled thousands of people out of their futures are not likely to be punished as severely as these innocent people.</p>

<p><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> It costs <a href="http://www.sentencing.org/facts.html">$23,000/yr to incarcerate each prisoner</a>. In comparison, the average <a href="http://www.libraryspot.com/know/tuition.htm">state college tuition</a> in the US is $2,848/yr. This implies that the US is 10x more concerned with imprisoning people than educating them.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/correct.htm">2.2 million</a> people in prison right now in the US. If we cut the average cost of incarceration by just $1,000/yr (4% decrease), that would be $2.2 billion in savings. That could give free college education to 785,000 people who can’t afford it. In other words, for every 2.8 people in prison, 1 person gets a free education at a state college.</p>
