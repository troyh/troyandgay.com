        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>After dinner, we came home and finished watching Harry Potter 2. As with the first movie, it was well-made, the cinematography and special effects were very good and was entertaining throughout the almost 2.5 hours. But again like the first movie, it’s definitely a kids’ movie. The characters are a little too shallow and the storyline is very simple with a happy ending. It’s a “thinking kids’ movie”, but a kids’ move nonetheless.</p>

        <article>
          <p>We had <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=34221">dinner</a> with some Recipezaar members last night at The Ruins: GinnyP, MeanChef and Ginny’s husband, Michael, and another couple who were friends of Ginny &amp; Michael.</p>

<p>I believe this is the first time we’ve ever met Recipezaar members in person. Ginny &amp; Michael were nice enough to treat us all to dinner (which must have been very expensive!).</p>

          <p>Today is our 5th Anniversary together! On this day 5 years ago, we went on our first date (I think to a <a href="http://www.brainwashed.com/bedhead/">Bedhead</a> concert at <a href="http://thecrocodile.com/">The Crocodile</a> in Seattle). One-and-a-half years later we quit our jobs and started <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a>. What a quick and fun 5 years it’s been. :-)</p>

        <article>
          <p>After our fourth outage in as many days as we scrambled to get Recipezaar’s new hardware and new cache architecture working, we were about to throw in the towel we were so fed up.  Finally Troy discovered the dumb permissions problem causing this last error and Recipezaar was running again, but the owners hit the wall.  We took the afternoon off, took a nap, had dinner at an outside restaurant (see Troy’s blog) and watched Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets – review to come, the old kids fell asleep watching it.</p>
