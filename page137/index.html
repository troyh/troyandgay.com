          <p>I had the <a href="http://www.ommegang.com/index.php?mcat=1&amp;scat=2">Ommegang Abbey Ale</a> that’s been sitting in the fridge for a few weeks now. I like it. It’s malty, very carbonated and, like the style, slightly fruity.</p>

<p>Ommegang brews Belgian-style beers and is located in Cooperstown, NY, of all places. The big Belgian brewer, Duvel, was an original investor but now owns them completely, I believe.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Sarah Palin <em>still</em> doesn’t know what the Vice President does. She was asked before she was picked by McCain and admitted she doesn’t know what the VP does. You’d think after that embarrassment, she’d go ask someone or, yikes, read something so she’d finally know. Nope, it’s clearly not important to her. Yesterday, two weeks before the election, “she was asked again”:http://www.9news.com/video/default.aspx?aid=63586 what the VP does and she proved she still hasn’t learned the answer. Here’s what she said:</p>

<p>bq. That’s something Piper would ask me, as a 2nd-grader, also.</p>

<p>Good thing Piper didn’t ask her, also. Imagine the other misinformation she teaches her kids.</p>

<p>bq. A Vice President has a really great job. Cuz not only are they there to support the President’s agenda, they’re like the team member, the teammate to that President, but they’re also in charge of the Senate so if they want to they can really get in there with the senators and make a lot of good policy changes that will make life better for Brandon and his family and his classroom.</p>

<p>The VP does not get involved in the Senate’s policy changes. The most a VP does is vote in a tie-breaker and the last time that happened was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Vice_Presidents%27_tie-breaking_votes">in 1989</a>. If you were hiring someone for a job, would you hire someone who not only doesn’t know what the job is, but doesn’t even care to know?</p>

<p>Notice how relieved she looked when the interviewer said the next question was coming from a 3rd grader and not one of those hard questions from reporters. Unfortunately for her, she can’t even answer questions from 3rd graders correctly. In what grade do you learn about the three branches of the US Government? Sarah Palin wants to have the #2 job in the US Government and doesn’t even know that she would be in the Executive Branch, not in the Legislative Branch.</p>

          <p>To their credit, some McCain supporters, including a McCain campaign spokesman, ran a couple out of their rally in Woodbridge, VA who were passing out bumper stickers implying that Obama is a “socialist with ties to radical Islam”:</p>

<p>Video removed because it auto-starts which is really annoying. <a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1463341016/bctid1866657225">See it here</a>.</p>

<p>I wonder how many of these morons who claim Obama is a socialist even know what socialism is. The idiots in this video obviously don’t. They used the Communist hammer and sickle, clearly confused between communism and socialism.</p>

          <p>Her latest <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/10/17/to_avoid_being_depressed_palin.html">speech addition</a>:</p>

<p>bq. “Just make sure people understand that we know what Joe the Plumber was talking about when he was confronting Barack Obama and saying, ‘Wait a minute, aren’t you going to take my money, take my earnings and give it to somebody else who maybe hadn’t worked as hard as I have worked?’”</p>

<p>So people who make less money than me don’t work as hard as me. Got it. Now I can tell the Republicans I know who make less money than me that they don’t work as hard as me. Slackers.</p>

<p>And she has taken to labeling some people “Pro-America” and “Anti-America”:</p>

<p>bq. Palin also made a point of mentioning that she loved to visit the “pro-America” areas of the country, of which North Carolina is one. No word on which states she views as unpatriotic.</p>

<p>Since she’s never spoken in Seattle, I can proudly say that I don’t live in Palin’s version of “America”.</p>

<p>One of my favorite political signs I’ve seen lately: “Hey Sarah, I can see the end of your career from my house!”</p>
