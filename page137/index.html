          </h3>
            <p>Paulson doesn’t know what to do, but he finally realized that “buying bad loans is a bad idea”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/13/business/economy/13bailout.html?hp:</p>

<p>bq. Mr. Paulson said the $700 billion would not be used to buy up troubled mortgage-related securities, as the rescue effort was originally conceived, but will instead be used in a broader campaign to bolster the financial markets and, in turn, make loans more accessible for creditworthy borrowers seeking car loans, student loans and other kinds of borrowing.</p>

<p>We don’t even know how much he’s spent on buying bad loans yet, i.e., wasted money by his own admission, since the bailout is not transparent. This is why government bailouts are a bad idea… one guy with little incentive trying to solve a problem that thousands of people with big incentives couldn’t solve is unlikely to work.</p>

<p>He talked about the executive management compensation:</p>

<p>bq. “Poorly designed management compensation policies can create perverse incentives that can ultimately jeopardize the health of the banking organization,” the agencies said, adding that they expect banking institutions “to regularly review their management compensation policies.”</p>

<p>In other words, paying high salaries to executives can encourage them to do things that harm their organizations. This is news? The more you pay someone, the more likely they’re going to think short-term rather than long-term. You put the carrot just out of reach so they keep working to get it, you don’t let them gorge on carrots so they have no incentive to work.</p>

            <a class="post-link" href="/2008/11/10/we-should-let-gm-and-ford-die.html">we should let GM and Ford die</a>
          </h3>
            <p>General Motors stock fell 22% today after “analysts downgraded the stock”:http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122633261247513857.html. The company is now worth less than $2 billion. Deutsche Bank even said the stock will fall to $0/share, meaning they think GM will be worthless. I could have told you that when I was 10 after my parents bought a Chevette.</p>

<p>General Motors and Ford are “begging for a federal bailout”:http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122616278065311225.html so they can stay in business and Democrats are working to give them their bailout. This is an example of my disagreement with the Democrats on economics. They’re doing it to save up to 500,000 jobs in America. Obama supports a bailout if they use the money to re-tool to build more fuel-efficient cars so they can better compete.</p>

<p>It’s a noble effort, but who are we kidding? GM and Ford built crappy products for the last three decades without regard for competition and instead launched a false patriotism campaign to “Buy American” and Americans fell for it. It only postponed the inevitable and benefitted Toyota and Honda, who were forced to work that much harder and build better products so they could sell them to Americans resistant to buy foreign cars. So Detroit and Americans, trying to help the country and fight the laws of capitalism, ended up inflicting more damage to the country: they weakened themselves and strengthened their competition.</p>

<p>Why do we think that GM and Ford going to suddenly start building better products now?</p>

<p>If they do die, there will be a lot of unemployed people in this country. That’s not good, of course, but the good employees will be able to get jobs at Toyota or Honda. The best employees could start new car companies (buying the equipment of Ford and GM for cheap prices). The executives of GM and Ford would be left out in the cold, but that’s okay because it’s their own fault.</p>

<p>But this is all moot because the government will give them the money. And the Democrats will be blamed when the companies continue to fail.</p>

            <p>Sarah Palin thought that Africa was a country and South Africa is a part, I assume the southern part, of the country of Africa. And get this, she couldn’t name the countries involved in NAFTA, which means she can’t name the three countries in North America. I imagine she thinks North America is comprised of Minnesota, Wisconsin, etc.</p>

<p>Plenty more here:</p>

<p>And Bill O’Reilly, not surprisingly, defends her ignorance of geography as something that can be taught to her. Yeah, it can be taught to children. But a 44 year-old college-educated person missed their chance to gain basic knowledge – she doesn’t have the <em>ability</em> to comprehend simple things. Oh, and by the way Bill O’Reilly, you brainless twit, she was trying to be the Vice President of our country! Is your brain on?! You’re such a bubblehead you work for Fox News, a fake news channel and I bet you think you’re a legitimate journalist.</p>

<p>Of course, this is all after the campaign is over and McCain lost. They were quite content to push this moron in the VP slot and let her lead the country even though they knew she was dumber than dirt. Country Last!</p>
