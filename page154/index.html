          </h3>
            <p>We picked Ouzo up from the vet today and took him home after his chemo treatment. He’s pretty lethargic and still doesn’t eat, but we hope that’s because of the chemo and he’ll be more active after the weekend. The doc says that the best-case for him is to live another four months, but will probably live half that. Even with chemo, it’s not curable so eventually the tumor will grow too big and prevent his heart from pumping blood.</p>

<p>We want to let him go humanely rather than wait until he dies in pain, so we have to watch him for signs of deterioration and make the decision. This is one of life’s curve balls… Illy is 13, which is old for a Labrador, so I was preparing myself for the day we have to make the decision about her. I never imagined Ouzo, at only 9, would go before her. Life’s too short, especially for a dog.</p>

            <p>Today was Hudson’s first visit to the doctor:</p>

<p>Everything looks good. He still has the normal baby rash, which is pretty hideous, and far worse than the rash that Havana had.</p>

            <p>Ouzo will get his first chemotherapy treatment tomorrow morning. We won’t know how well it works other than to monitor his behavior but the doc thinks the tumor wouldn’t have to shrink much to alleviate the problem. And it has to stop growing, of course.</p>

<p>We should be able to pick him up tomorrow after his treatment.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We talked to “the vet”:http://www.vcavsc.com/ this morning. Ouzo’s abdomen looks good except for one small tumor in his spleen. They’re going to try to get a sample from that and check it out. They are also going to check his lymph nodes in his neck that are a little bigger than normal. Other than that, he seems to be feeling fine and is eating well and playing with the vets. It’s only a matter of time, unfortunately. He could live days, weeks or months.</p>

<p>We’re going to get him home as soon as possible so we can spend some more time with him while we can. At least Havana got to know him.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2803296323/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3265/2803296323_ffcfb6ab8e.jpg" alt="IMG_0382.JPG" /></a></p>

<p>Ever since Havana moved into her own room, Ouzo slept outside her bedroom as if he was guarding her. And, not realizing there was a baby monitor in our bedroom, he’d come get us if she ever cried. On the bright side, we can spoil him all we want with people food.</p>
