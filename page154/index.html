<p>It’s that time of the year on Vashon: blackberry season. Havana loves picking and eating blackberries.</p>

<p>It’s turning Fall – one of my four favorite seasons in Seattle.I snapped this photo after making breakfast for Havana today. It’s amazing to watch the fog roll in across Puget Sound with the sun rising.</p>

              <p>Finally even the conservatives have figured out that Palin is a disaster. It was okay with them when she was just a disaster for the country, but now that they’ve realized she’s a disaster for their party, they’re singing a different tune. The conservative magazine National Review now thinks <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDZiMDhjYTU1NmI5Y2MwZjg2MWNiMWMyYTUxZDkwNTE=">she should drop out</a>:</p>

<p>bq. If Palin were a man, we’d all be guffawing, just as we do every time Joe Biden tickles the back of his throat with his toes. But because she’s a woman – and the first ever on a Republican presidential ticket – we are reluctant to say what is painfully true. What to do? … Only Palin can save McCain, her party, and the country she loves. She can bow out for personal reasons, perhaps because she wants to spend more time with her newborn. No one would criticize a mother who puts her family first.</p>

<p>Agreed! I think she should just announce that her husband has entered a “Ricky Gervais”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Gervais look-alike contest and he needs her support.</p>

<p>“My husband has, you know, entered a, umm, important competition, one that is critical to the future of all Alaskans… oh, and as well as Americans and their constituencies and their friends and families, a competition that will decide how closely our people compare to Mr. Gervais and to the people of other countries and faiths and religions and backgrounds and cultures and diversities and I know the American people, including Alaskans, understand how crucial this campaign is to our democracy, and the Constitution, and to our young people and leaders and military and their families so I believe that I must do what is right for my husband in his time of great sacrifice and efforts and provide my love and support and my speeching talents that have helped me very greatly in my career in politics in the great state of Alaska in his endeavor and enterprises on this day and the days to come.”</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Palin said that Alaska’s proximity to Russia gives her foreign policy experience and she was laughed at because, well, it’s an idiotic statement. Now Katie Couric asked her about it and she seemed to dismiss it as just a flippant comment that she’s being made fun of over. Ok, that’d be smart, claim she was taken out of context and move on. But then goes on to defend it!:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbs.com/thunder/swf30can10cbsnews/rcpHolderCbs-3-4x3.swf">http://www.cbs.com/thunder/swf30can10cbsnews/rcpHolderCbs-3-4x3.swf</a></p>

<p>(She’s so eloquent and coherent, isn’t she?)</p>

<p>Is she implying that Russia invades Alaska often? Or is she implying that they are about to? Does she realize that Russia is our ally? At least she doesn’t seem to think she’s protecting us from Canada.</p>

<p>I wish Couric had asked her if the governors of Washington, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas are all foreign policy experts too since they actually <em>touch</em> other countries. Certainly in her teeny tiny brain they are.</p>

<p>Hell, I can see Puget Sound from my house. That makes me a marine biologist. I’ve seen lots and lots of numbers in my life, that makes me a mathematician… or an economist… or, why not, both! I’ve dropped things, that makes me a physicist. I used soap today, that makes me a chemist. I’m listening to music right now, I’m a musician.</p>

<p>When Sarah Palin’s parents told her she can be anything she wants to be, she took them literally. She is dumb. No wonder Republicans think women are inferior, this is what they consider their best and brightest.</p>
