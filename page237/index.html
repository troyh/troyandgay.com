          <p>[](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&amp;id=0&amp;t=45)After several attempts in the last few months, I’ve finally switched to “Firefox”:http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/index.html as my default browser and I like it! It’s easier to access the tabs (Cmd+1 for tab 1, Cmd+2 for tab 2, etc.), other apps open windows in new tabs so less clutter on my screen, it’s fast, smooth-scrolling, popup-blocking and my favorite feature, I can add any search engine to the Search box (Safari only allowed Google). Other niceties include easy searching on the page (just start typing) and it doesn’t let me mistakenly close the window and all tabs when I really just wanted to close the one tab. And, for web developers, the “web developer toolbar”:http://www.chrispederick.com/work/firefox/webdeveloper/ is amazing.</p>

<p>My only complaint is that the fonts are bigger than they are on Safari, and there’s no preference to change it.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Last night, I wanted to try out “NewsFire”:http://www.newsfirerss.com/ but I didn’t want to go to the trouble of adding all my feeds that I read on “MyWireService”:http://mywireservice.com. It would be nice if NewsFire (or any RSS aggregator) could just work against MyWireService to get my news. Two things made this possible: 1) Gay was out for the night again volunteering for the Vashon debate team to help them in another tournament this weekend and 2) I wrote MyWireService so I can make it do anything I want. :)</p>

<p>So while I watched the end of “Gothika”:http://gothikamovie.warnerbros.com/ (ugh, terrible movie) on TiVo and had a glass of wine, I added a cool feature to MyWireService: it can now generate an RSS feed of all the updates to all the RSS feeds in each of my sections. So I can use any RSS aggregator to read my news and continues to solve “the RSS bandwidth problem”:http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1648625,00.asp. And possibly even better, I saved Gay from having to watch <em>Gothika</em>.</p>

<p>And even better, we can now do some cool stuff, and very easily, with food-related news on “Recipezaar”:http://www.recipezaar.com that we’ve been planning. Since Gay won’t be home til late tonight and it’s too wet to mow the lawn, I have my Saturday project planned. :)</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2245.jpg" alt="IMG_2245.jpg" />The drywall guys came today and in just 3 hours had the drywall up. It’s starting to look like an office again.</p>

<p>Yesterday we found out that the electrician is trying to charge $1200 to install the ethernet jacks. One jack install costs $300, but a phone jack costs $75 (still too high, but much more reasonable). And because we want four jacks, the cost is four times as high! It’s no more work to run one cable than 4 or 8 or 16 cables. There’s a slight amount of work per ethernet port, but even that is maybe a minute of work. Charging 25% or even 50% above the cost of installing one jack is reasonable, but 100% more per jack is outrageous. So there’s likely to be a bit of disagreement on that bill. :)</p>

<p>They can get away with this because people think computer stuff is so complex that it must be harder to install an ethernet jack. But even an idiot like me can wire an ethernet jack, it’s no more difficult than a phone jack.</p>

<p>The other scam we discovered about construction is that even on a Time &amp; Materials basis, they charge a premium on materials! So when they buy a 2x4, we are charged for the 2x4 plus 16%. The windows were even worse; we paid for the windows themselves, some unknown amount to the sales rep and then another 16% to the contractor, and the contractor didn’t do anything other than tell the rep the dimensions!</p>

<p>I was a software consultant for years and everything was T&amp;M and we <em>never</em> charged a dime for materials (software, hardware, etc.) – we charged cost. And we weren’t different, it was unheard of to charge extra for materials. The only money we made was on man-hours. When/if we do any more construction work, we’re going to be our own project manager and we’ll buy stuff directly from the distributor and cut out the middlemen.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.speakeasy.net/">Speakeasy</a> is <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/198924_speakeasy10.html">building and testing</a> a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimax">WiMax</a> network across Seattle. It’s interesting, of course, but they’re going to charge crazy prices: $650/month. Obviously, they’re gearing it to businesses, but it’s still insane. No business is going to run their network on a wireless connection just because of security concerns, so they can’t replace their internal network or their IT guy. So the only thing this replaces is their internet connectivity. But why would a business need a wireless connection – offices aren’t mobile, who cares if there’s a wire running into their office? Besides, a business can get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DS1">T-1</a> from Speakeasy themselves for $500/mo, cheaper than their WiMax offering. Or better yet, they can get a Comcast connection that is 3+ Mbps (ours is 4.5Mbps) down and 1Mbps up for $50/mo and is more reliable than a wireless connection.</p>

<p>I suspect Speakeasy will roll it out and it’ll fail and then they’ll try selling accounts to regular people for $40/mo. That’ll fail too because it’s pretty easy to get a WiFi connection in Seattle for free already.</p>

        </h3>

          <p>We did it, we hit “100,000 recipes”:http://www.recipezaar.com! It took over four years and countless (wo)man hours, both in our time and in the time of people typing up their recipes. In the early days we received less than 10 recipes per month, by spring of 2001 we were receiving several hundred a month, and by spring of 2002 we were receiving thousands per month and that hasn’t slowed down at all. We reject approximately 3% of all recipes per month and we’ve recently started removing duplicates (1% so far). At over 100,000 recipes, Recipezaar is hands down the largest collection of electronic recipes in the universe!!</p>

<p>In the early days, our software was pretty simple and required lots of manual editing and I was improving and debugging the software as I processed recipes. After about 18 months, the software was stable enough that Gay could start using it. And she had lots more suggestions for improving/streamlining the process. After she had processed 54,180 recipes, Kathy took it over (and very quickly) processing 10,249 recipes taking us over 100,000. The software is a far cry from the early versions of it, but it still has room for improvement. One day we hope to make it so easy to use that anyone on the site can submit their own recipe easily without any intervention from us.</p>

<p>6% of the recipes now have photos, and there are 7,044 total photos. In fact, we now post over 1,000 photos per month, or almost 1 photo for every 2 recipes posted. At over 2,000 recipes every month, that’s 5+ large cookbooks (a $150 value) every month and 15+ cooking magazines (a $50 value) every month! And they’re all free! And with 1.24 photos per recipe, we’re already far ahead of the cookbook and magazine industry that publish at most one photo per recipe (the vast majority of published recipes have no photo at all).</p>

<p>48% of all the recipes have reviews, averaging 2.72 reviews per recipe. 20,000 people have submitted reviews, averaging 2.3 reviews per reviewer.</p>

<p>What percentage of the recipes are liked by people? Almost every single recipe, 99,606, are in more than one person’s cookbook (“To Die For Crockpot Roast”:http://www.recipezaar.com/recipe/getrecipe.zsp?id=27208 is in over 4,000 cookbooks). 76% are in more than ten persons’ cookbooks. And 13% are in more than 50 persons’ cookbooks. Clearly, people’s tastes are as diverse as the diversity of the recipes. That was one of our original theories and it has panned out.</p>

<p>The benefits of recipes in electronic form, published on the web with photos and reviews and comments submitted by real people, it’s only a matter of time until the archaic world of printed cookbooks and cooking magazines, the 2nd largest sector of the publishing industry, is gone. It’s already obsolete, it just takes time now. Think of all the trees that will be saved. :)</p>

<p>Top 10 most-common ingredients:
1. salt (39% of all recipes)
2. butter (29%)
3. sugar (25%)
4. eggs (24%)
5. onions (23%)
6. garlic (20%)
7. water (18%)
8. flour (14%)
9. milk (13%)
10. olive oil (11%)</p>

<p>Top 10 most-common measurements:
1. cups
2. teaspoons
3. tablespoons
4. ounces
5. pounds
6. cloves
7. grams
8. slices
9. pinches
10. milliliters</p>

<p>Least-common measurement: bushels.</p>
