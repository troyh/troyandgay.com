            <p>Kelly had to go to her grandfather’s funeral today and Gay had a doctor’s appointment in the city so we piled all 3 kids in the Jeep and went to the house. We stopped at Home Depot to pick up a sheet of drywall and drywall screws so I could build my little walls to mount the speakers in. I also brought <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/01/30/triad-ds-100-speakers/">the Triad speakers</a> along to install at the house.</p>

<p>After a quick stop at the Starbucks drive-in for coffee and breakfast goodies, we got to the house. The drywall and materials were being stocked in the house and we saw all the insulation that was put in last week. Gay left Hudson with me while she, Havana and Eva went to her doctor’s appointment. Hudson played with the iPad while I worked on installing the foyer speakers. Gay got back with lunch and then took the kids out for haircuts (they couldn’t get in, so no haircuts) and for some playtime at University Village. I got the speakers installed, but one needs some adjustment, and tested them to make sure they work.</p>

<p>We stopped at Zeek’s on the way home for dinner, the first time all 5 of us went out to dinner together.</p>

            <p>I’ve been working on selecting the audio/video equipment for those house and we’ll be putting in-ceiling speakers in most of the rooms. They’ll mostly be unseen, unless you look up at the ceiling, but in the foyer we couldn’t put speakers in the ceiling because the ceiling is inaccessible without disturbing the woodwork. We could have put in-wall speakers in the foyer but in-wall speakers are more noticeable since you tend to look at walls. I found some truly invisible speakers from <a href="http://www.triadspeakers.com/designerseries/products/ds100.html">Triad</a>. They mount in the drywall and get plastered over with the surrounding drywall so it looks like a normal wall.</p>

<p>I read <a href="http://www.hometheater.com/inwallspeakers/triad_ds500_in-wall_speaker_system/">a review of the higher-end model</a> that sounded good, but I was still skeptical. They arrived on Friday and I got a chance to test them today. I’m not an audiophile by any means, but I’m impressed. I assumed they’d sound muddy, but the sound is very bright. In fact, there’s very little bass at all, since they require that you also use a high-pass filter to filter out the lower frequency sound so as not to knock plaster off the wall. The highs are every bit as bright as my 16 year-old floor-standing Klipsch speakers, possibly more. They just lack any low-range sound. I bet a subwoofer would make these good enough for mid-range dedicated listening speakers.</p>

<p>These are going to get installed in the  house this week, possibly even tomorrow, since the drywall is starting to go in this week.</p>

<p>At $550/ea, they’re more expensive than the traditional in-ceiling speakers we’re going to use in the rest of the house. I ordered three pairs of speakers in the $300-350/ea price range from <a href="http://www.klipsch.com/">Klipsch</a>, <a href="http://www.definitivetech.com/">Definitive Technology</a> and <a href="http://www.noble-fidelity.com/">Noble Fidelity</a> to decide on what to use where total invisibility isn’t required. Those should arrive this week and I’m excited to test them.</p>

<p>Our new neighborhood has an annual “progressive” dinner, a dinner where each course (appetizers, dinner and dessert) are hosted at a different house. People who don’t host bring and prepare the food. Tonight was the 25th annual dinner and we were invited. Kelly could work today so we could go sans kids – our first evening out since Eva’s birth.</p>

<p>Gay made crab cakes and brought a cheese platter. Everyone brings 2 bottles of wine, but I was asked to bring beer so we stopped at The Beer Junction on the way. We had already met many of the neighbors but there were a few more that we got to meet. Appetizers were at the Pipers’ across the street, the main course was at the Welland/Jordan’s and dessert was at the Willison’s house. The food was great and I was surprised to find that I really liked the Imperial Pilsner that I brought, which was intended to be palatable to non-beer nerds like me. Between courses, we cleaned up and pack up the wine/beer and all walk to the next house.</p>

<p>Each year they award a Gardening award to someone in the neighborhood and this year <em>we won it</em> for taking down the Monkey Puzzle Trees! Either no one else did anything to their gardens this year or the neighborhood appreciates the removal of those trees almost as much as I do. The award is a large bottle of Galliano that must stay at your house for the year before moving to the next winner’s house. This bottle has clearly made the rounds for many years.</p>

<p>We heard some good advice about preschools – lots of choices! The street also has some cycling fans, and we talked about spending the month of July glued to the TV every year watching the Tour de France. I’m really looking forward to that in the new house – I specifically designed the TV location, doors and deck location so that I could watch the TdF while on the hammock outside. Several of the guys on the street go for a 2-hour bike ride every Sunday morning at 7:30a, rain or shine. I haven’t been on a group bike ride since ‘98 or ‘99 so I’m looking forward to being able to get back on the bike again and show these guys how slow I can go.</p>

<p>We didn’t leave until 10:30p, so we missed the 10:20p ferry home but made it to the dock in plenty of time to catch the 11:40p ferry and get home after midnight. I won’t miss the ferries.</p>

            <p>Gay, Eva and I took the 9am ferry to go back to the house. We were meeting Katie and Jim (and Mark, who is always there) to talk budget, schedule and get Jim’s advice on a few things. I was also able to install some more blocking in the basement and did a better job this time (I think).</p>

<p>I also got Mark and Colin, who is
framing the garage interior, to put my trapdoor in the garage floor again, which we had nixed from the plans months ago. This will give me easy access to the top of the Jeep for loading and unloading.</p>

<p>Mark also gave me a couple Schuchart/Dow shirts, making me an honorary carpenter.</p>
