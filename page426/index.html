              <p>People are finally starting to admit that XML is harder than it should be! Tim Bray, the creator of XML, himself even <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/16/XML-Prog">says so</a>. In my view, XML has two advantages: 1) it’s structured and 2) it’s becoming accepted by the masses.</p>

<p>And #2 is the most important one. We’ve had comma/tab-separated files that were simpler and, egads, actually worked, but there was no hype surrounding it. So now we have XML being marketed to all the dopey programmers of the world (to sell them XML tools, of course), so it’ll probably catch on and stick. I remember a couple years ago somebody at an unnamed company asked me if Recipezaar uses XML and he was happy when I said it does. He didn’t even know what that meant and didn’t care  how we used it or what the DTDs we used were, but the magic letters X, M &amp; L were meaningful to him. That’s when I knew XML was gonna be big.</p>

              <p>War should start on Thursday. This is the 2nd war of my lifetime (well, there was Vietnam but I was too young to remember) and it’s with the same country. Now that everything’s said and done, I do looko forward to Saddam being out of power very soon. And it was a surrender-fest in ‘91 so I hope that this becomes the Mother Of All Surrenders. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/18/sprj.irq.troops/index.html">Reports</a> say that it’s already happening. And even France <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/18/sprj.irq.france.chemicals/index.html">says it’ll join the war</a> if Saddam uses chemical weapons (that he says he doesn’t have).</p>

              <p>Interesting <a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/2003/0314.petreley.html">story</a> about how Windows’ marketshare is overestimated and Linux’s marketshare is underestimated (and it’s gotta be similar for the Mac). I don’t know how true that is, but the facts are pretty clear: Linux has the momentum and any developer today investing in Windows skills is making a career-ending move. I remember when a developer had better know Windows to have a future, but today that’s simply not the case.  If a developer is learning <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/techinfo/articles/upgrade/Csharpintro.asp">C#</a> and not <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a> or <a href="http://php.net">PHP</a> or learning .Net and not <a href="http://xmlrpc.org">XML-RPC</a>/<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/">SOAP</a>, or an IT person is learning Windows administration and not Linux administration they’re gonna have a hard time in a few years finding work.</p>

              <p>It sounds like we’ll be at war in Iraq this week. <a href="http://www.skirsch.com/politics/iraq/Lessons911.htm">The 5 lessons of 911</a> is interesting.</p>

<p>Of course, I’m against the war (I’m anti-killing). But I think the UN blew it on this one. Since <a href="http://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm">its inception</a>, this is the first chance the UN has had to show the world that it is an authoritative body. Five months ago, they <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/11/08/iraq.resolution/">voted</a> <em>unanimously</em> to force Iraq to disarm and to support military action if they didn’t disarm. <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/world/default-200312716917.htm">They didn’t disarm</a>. But the UN is still mired in debate over something they agreed to just 5 months ago. I believe that if the UN was a united front against Hussein for the last 5 months instead of being wishy-washy, this would have been resolved peacefully: either Hussein would take his billions and run away or he’d be overthrown.</p>

<p>The sad reality is that in the future, when the UN speaks, world leaders will ignore it. But they will likely not ignore the US. And that’s unlikely to create a peaceful world (and will “Americanize” the world with McDonald’s restaurants, Wal*Marts and lousy beer).</p>

              <p>I mentioned this before but I finally signed up for <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com">O’Reilly’s Safari</a> because I wanted to read some chapters from a book to fix a sysadmin problem and couldn’t wait a week or more for a real book to arrive. Safari had the book, so I signed up (ironically, the sign up process doesn’t work with the <a href="http://apple.com/safari">Safari</a> web browser).</p>

<p>The particular book didn’t help me solve my problem, but now I know that and for only $9.99, I saved $35-50 on the book! And now I can read 4 other books this month for free. But the coolest thing about Safari is that you can post public or private comments on any page of the book! If this gets popular, it’ll basically be like reading someone else’s highlighting and corrections and clarifications. You can’t do that without the internet!</p>

<p>On the downside, the service is kinda slow, sometimes taking a minute or more to get to the next page.</p>

<p>And I did solve my original problem, but had more luck with Google searching mailing list archives.</p>
