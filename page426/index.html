            <p>It sounds like we’ll be at war in Iraq this week. <a href="http://www.skirsch.com/politics/iraq/Lessons911.htm">The 5 lessons of 911</a> is interesting.</p>

<p>Of course, I’m against the war (I’m anti-killing). But I think the UN blew it on this one. Since <a href="http://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm">its inception</a>, this is the first chance the UN has had to show the world that it is an authoritative body. Five months ago, they <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/11/08/iraq.resolution/">voted</a> <em>unanimously</em> to force Iraq to disarm and to support military action if they didn’t disarm. <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/world/default-200312716917.htm">They didn’t disarm</a>. But the UN is still mired in debate over something they agreed to just 5 months ago. I believe that if the UN was a united front against Hussein for the last 5 months instead of being wishy-washy, this would have been resolved peacefully: either Hussein would take his billions and run away or he’d be overthrown.</p>

<p>The sad reality is that in the future, when the UN speaks, world leaders will ignore it. But they will likely not ignore the US. And that’s unlikely to create a peaceful world (and will “Americanize” the world with McDonald’s restaurants, Wal*Marts and lousy beer).</p>

            <p>I mentioned this before but I finally signed up for <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com">O’Reilly’s Safari</a> because I wanted to read some chapters from a book to fix a sysadmin problem and couldn’t wait a week or more for a real book to arrive. Safari had the book, so I signed up (ironically, the sign up process doesn’t work with the <a href="http://apple.com/safari">Safari</a> web browser).</p>

<p>The particular book didn’t help me solve my problem, but now I know that and for only $9.99, I saved $35-50 on the book! And now I can read 4 other books this month for free. But the coolest thing about Safari is that you can post public or private comments on any page of the book! If this gets popular, it’ll basically be like reading someone else’s highlighting and corrections and clarifications. You can’t do that without the internet!</p>

<p>On the downside, the service is kinda slow, sometimes taking a minute or more to get to the next page.</p>

<p>And I did solve my original problem, but had more luck with Google searching mailing list archives.</p>

            <p>Had Gary &amp; <a href="http://nancysipple.mywindermere.com/">Nancy</a> &amp; <a href="http://heatherbrynn.mywindermere.com/index.cfm?resetclient=1&amp;CFID=1958143&amp;CFTOKEN=51741130">Heather</a> &amp; Larry (“Leather &amp; Harry”) over for dinner last night and played Trivial Pursuit. Too much wine. Nancy brought a delicious dessert over, unfortunately the recipe came from Bon Appetit.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Kevin &amp; Rachel and Reid &amp; Marissa threw a lovely engagement party for Mark &amp; Emily – only EIGHT years in the making ;-).  Mark’s sister Lisa is about to strike out in her own law practice (let me know if you need a great family law attorney in Seattle).  I just love hearing about people starting their own businesses.  Also learned Stork (Chris) is working on becoming a psychologist; this is after leaving a career as a medical doctor, and a degree in philosophy earned between, I think.  Interesting because he must have the most understanding and supportive wife in the universe (Gwenneth), but also because he was a bit of a hero to me – working in Viet Nam on protheses for land mine victims and then in the burn ward.  Turns out the latter was just too much…he couldn’t handle being around so much death.  One of the most interesting “I’m changing my life” conversations I’ve had…</p>

            <p>Fun dinner with Nancy &amp; Gary and Heather &amp; Larry which evolved into a crushing game of Trivial Pursuit.</p>
