          <p>My <a href="/archives/2003/02/001230.php">10-day-old PowerMac</a> has a Philips CDR drive and it just died this morning. OS X can’t mount any drive and the drive refuses to read any CD, CDR or DVD and keeps ejecting them. Called  Apple Care’s tech support and they can’t fix the problem. Now I need to take it into a local service center.

This is frustrating enough, but the other day my iBook’s screen started turning off when I adjust its position. All the way back it goes out, slightly forward and it comes back on, forward more and it goes out and then still forward more it comes back on. And bumping it makes the screen flicker off and on. Obviously a loose connection in the hinge. Apparently, <a href="http://discussions.info.apple.com/WebX?50@202.RR3yarEZhTR.0@.3bb8aa5f">this is somewhat common</a> on the iBook and sounds like a design flaw in the hinge. Moral: don’t push the display back too far on your iBook.</p>

<p>Is Apple hardware always this flakey? Feels like I got a Dell.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Talked to two local Apple-certified specialists. I have to take it in, drop it off, they’ll “verify” that it’s broken within 3-5 business days and, if they “verify” that it doesn’t work (cuz I’m such an idiot I can’t tell myself that it doesn’t work, some guy with 6 months computer experience under his belt with an Apple-logo’d business card is better qualified), they’ll order a new drive from Apple, wait for it to be delivered, install it and then I can pick it up. All in all, expect to be without your computer for 2-3 weeks. 2-3 weeks! If my car was totalled I could have it repaired in that time. But a $200 CD drive requires as long because I was stupid enough to buy a computer that has just one vendor. If I had a Dell, I’d go to CompUSA, plunk down $50 and have a new drive working this afternoon. You’d think they could immediately replace the drive and if the new one works, let me take it and leave. Nope. They have to go by Apple’s rules.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: I called Apple and (calmly) explained the problem to a very nice Canadian woman. I explained how it is a bit crazy that Apple is forcing me to be without my Mac for 2-3 weeks just because my rarely-used CD drive is malfunctioning. I asked if they could just send me a replacement drive and I’d send the old one back and that they could charge me if I was an idiot and the drive worked. She was skeptical that she could do that, but she put me on hold for a few seconds, then came back and said she could do it! So in a week or so, I should have a replacement Combo Drive. Way to go Apple!</p>

          <p>Wow, O’Reilly has Netflix-for-eBooks! <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">Safari Online</a> lets you rent electronic books from publishers such as O’Reilly, Addison-Wesley, New Riders, Prentice Hall, Que, etc. For $10/mo to $30/mo you can have 5-30 books in your “bookshelf” and have full-access to them as long as you want (and pay the subscription fee). They currently have 1,251 books in the collection. Given that these are all technical books, reading them at your computer is not a bad thing. Just brilliant!</p>

<p>I seem to have lost my copy of Knuth’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/books/0201485419/102-9164715-1174537">Searching &amp; Sorting</a>, but unfortunately, it’s not in the set (yet?).  Otherwise, I’d sign up right now!</p>

          <p>I just “upgraded” to Red Hat 8.0 on my dual-boot Windows machine. Linux on the desktop is still a long way away from matching Windows. Windows, of course, is about as klunky and confusing as you can get, but Linux is just trying to match it, warts and all. Gnome even uses Windows’ illogical Alt+F4 to close apps! And then it doesn’t use the Windows key to bring up the Start, ahem, Red Hat menu. Is anyone thinking? And my Palm V doesn’t work with it either, although it did work with Red Hat 7.2.</p>

<p>But the most frustrating thing was switching resolutions; Red Hat 7.2 did the “test” to make sure my monitor and video card actually worked before finalizing  the new resolution, but 8.0 just says “okey dokey” and then the next time you reboot (or logout or restart the GUI) you’re left with a resolution you can’t use. I had to reinstall to fix this. Backwards.</p>

<p>On the bright side, it includes the great file manager Nautilus that, in my opinion, is even better than the Mac’s Finder (not surprising though, since Nautilus was built by Eazel, which was founded by ex-Apple people). And “BlueCurve” is not the  ugliest thing in the world, definitely a step up from the grotesque Gnome GUI and you don’t feel like a 3-year old like you do with XP’s PlaySkool GUI. And it’s just jaw-dropping how much faster Linux is than Windows… on the same (600MHz PIII w/ 256MB RAM) machine, Windows XP chunks away at even the most trivial of tasks while everything pops up instantly on Linux.</p>

<p>I love Linux on the server, it simply can’t be beat there. But the Mac is still light years ahead of anything else on the desktop.</p>

          <p>Had take-out dinner from Express Cuisine for the first time and then watched <a href="http://www.foxsearchlight.com/onehourphoto/">One Hour Photo</a>. Why is it that Robin Williams, a “comedian”, is lousy at comedy but great in dramatic roles? From <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/movies/detail/movie/168072">Awakenings</a> to <a href="http://dontcloseyoureyes.warnerbros.com/">Insomnia</a> to this movie, he’s just great. Who takes photos on film these days, though?</p>
