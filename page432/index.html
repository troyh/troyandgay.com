              <p>If Saddam Hussein is not linked to al Qaeda (and I don’t think he is), and he has not restarted a nuclear weapons program (which I don’t think he has); then he is really no worse than any other despot out there (which I believe there are many).  We should work hard to remove him from power, because it is the right thing to do, with the help of international support.  I am not against war, but I think it is deplorable that we can’t get do it with the diplomacy and a unified front.  “History will turn, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/08/international/middleeast/08ASSE.html?th">he implied</a>, on what the Council members do now, whether they hang together as a world body or splinter apart in bitter dissent over American war plans in Iraq.”

“Still, inside the Security Council, many diplomats believe that the most important debate is over whether nations should simply bow to America’s will by joining the coalition in hopes of influencing the conduct of the war that Mr. Bush appears poised to unleash. A number of nations seem determined to hold their ground, diplomats report, in the belief that no superpower can function in isolation.”</p>

<p>Has anyone considered how our own economy might be improved if we took the billions we are going to spend on war and spend it at home instead…</p>

              <p>It sure feels like they’re closing in on bin Laden. <strike>They've now [captured](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;ncid=578&amp;e=2&amp;cid=578&amp;u=/nm/20030307/ts_nm/attack_qaeda_dc) 2 of his (50?) sons and killed other Al-Qaeda dorks.</strike> I bet they kill or capture bin Laden this month. But I hope they capture him and we can see pathetic pictures of him like we did his buddy.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I guess they didn’t really capture 2 of his sons. How do these rumors get started??</p>

              <p>I happened across <a href="http://taxes.yahoo.com/filing.html">TurboTax for the web</a> today. We need more web applications and this is a perfect application for the web – it’s always up-to-date data-wise, bugs can be fixed immediately, no downloads necessary, etc. The only downside is that you’re giving a corporation (Intuit) very personal info about yourself, which is not usually a good idea. But I wish QuickBooks and Quicken were also web apps (Quicken is well on its way already, though).</p>

              <p>TiVo <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rc/030306/tech_tivo_earns_1.html">announced quarterly earnings</a> today. They’re still  losing money ($21 million for the year) but they’re growing and now have 624,000 subscribers. I believe their goal is 1 million by the end of the year. I can’t wait til they ship the <a href="http://tivo.com/4.9.asp">Home Media Option</a> so I can view my <a href="http://apple.com/iphoto/">iPhoto</a> pics and listen to my <a href="http://apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> music through TiVo.</p>

<p>And I wish they’d start competing with Netflix. They now have the tools to deliver almost-on-demand movies. I’d pay for that!</p>
