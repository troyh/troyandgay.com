          <p>We were invited by our friends at Wells Fargo to “Wells Fargo Day” at “Qwest field”:http://www.seahawks.com/stadium.aspx?SecID=31 to see the “Seahawks”:http://www.seahawks.com/default.aspx?SecID=3 game. We got to sit in the Wells Fargo clubhouse, which means free beer &amp; wine, a heated room with movie-theater seating. The stadium is new and much much much better than the old “Kingdome”:http://www.metrokc.gov/stadium/ it replaced. The Seahawks ended a three-game losing streak by beating the Panthers, 23-17.</p>

          <p>This shocked me… the guy who runs “Electoral-Vote.com”:http://www.electoral-vote.com/ announced who he was today and he is none other than <em>the</em> “Andrew Tanenbaum”:http://www.electoral-vote3.com/info/votemaster-faq.html! All computer science students know who he is (or, they should!) – he’s the author of a couple textbooks on operating systems and is the creator of “Minix”:http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/minix.html#whatisminix, the precursor to Linux. Small world. :)</p>

<p>And I love his reason for making Electoral-Vote.com: <em>“In a nutshell, because living abroad I know first hand what the world thinks of America and it is not a pretty picture at the moment. I want people to think of America as the land of freedom and democracy, not the land of arrogance and blind revenge. I want to be proud of America again.”</em></p>

<p>Me too. Vote tomorrow!</p>

          <p>Pitchfork has lousy “review”:http://pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/r/rem/around-the-sun.shtml of R.E.M.’s new album, one I like quite a bit. I think it’s their best album since <em>Automatic for the People</em>.</p>

        <article>
          <p>The NYT is covering “the oil spill that hit Vashon Island”:http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/31/national/31spill.html?ex=1256875200&amp;en=c8c05500a7b58d58&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland: “On Vashon island, residents simply want the offender caught and punished.” That’s an understatement.  Why does this take so long?</p>
