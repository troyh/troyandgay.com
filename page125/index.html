          <p>The Steelers <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09012/941276-66.stm?cmpid=steelers.xml">beat the Chargers</a> to go to the Championship game against the Ravens.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/images/200901/20000112pd_steel1_330.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Ravens was the one team I was hoping would lose during the playoffs because I think the Steelers could beat any of the other teams. They can beat the Ravens too, and did twice this year, but the Ravens will be tough.</p>

<p>The Steelers were the only team this weekend who was favored to win that did win, the only home team to win and the only team with a bye week last week to win. And it ended up not mattering that they were the #2 seed and not the #1 seed because, thanks the Titans losing, they get to play at home through the playoffs.</p>

          <p>AllRecipes finally got with the program and <a href="http://allrecipes.com/features/more/supportingmembership/ComingSoon.aspx">announced a Premium membership</a>. Although they call it “Supporting Membership”, which sounds more like a beg for charity than a premium service. We at Recipezaar launched a Premium Membership back in 2003 and it took AllRecipes that long to copy it, with fewer features and a higher price. Genius!</p>

<p>There is no love lost between me and AllRecipes. Their mouthpiece, Esmee Williams, used to harass us every time we did something new, sometimes demanding that we remove recipes because they were too close to recipes on their site and got huffy when we explained how copyrights work. At one point she directed us to the <a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/">Chilling Effects</a> site to prove the legitimacy of her claim, not realizing that the site is run by the <a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> to protect people from the “chilling effects” (violations of 1st Amendment rights) of copyrights or that we were on the right side of the copyright law. We even had many AllRecipes employees contact us looking for jobs. When Reader’s Digest bought them after years of attempts by AllRecipes to find a buyer, Esmee emailed us the press release as if to gloat (Congratulations Esmee, you have a new boss. That’s quite an accomplishment!). The company is an embarrassment and I have enjoyed watching them flounder time and time again.  Maybe by copying Recipezaar feature-for-feature, they’ve found a path to success. But I doubt it.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Gay and I went to “Beveridge Place Pub”:http://www.beveridgeplacepub.com/ for a rare date night, only the second time we’ve left Hudson at home. We’ve driven by it for years and never felt tempted to go in, but ever since discovered that it’s a highly-regarded beer place we’ve been trying to get a chance to go. Hours before we left, I checked their web site to see what beers they have on tap (they don’t list them, unfortunately) and realized that they don’t serve food at all. Instead, they provide a set of local restaurants that will deliver to the pub. That doesn’t make for such a nice date night, but we decided to not change our plans and we went anyway. I’m glad we did.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I agree with the general consensus, this is a great beer bar. They have 18 taps of mostly Washington and Oregon beers. It’s a very casual place, a very English-style pub with various styles of furniture and a couple couches.</p>

<p>I was happy to find out they had three bourbon barrel-aged beers: Schooner Exact Hoppy the Woodsman (a tiny West Seattle brewery), Issaquah’s Quad Frog and “Pike’s Entire”:http://beernews.org/2008/11/pike-entire-wood-aged-stout-drops-this-monday/ (7% ABV%), a beer I’ve been looking for for a while now, so that’s what I ordered. Gay got the Schooner Exact Hoppy the Woodsman. I really liked the Pike Entire, but it was slightly too oak-flavored and not hoppy enough for me. I’d pick The Abyss over this one if I had a choice (apparently, last week they had The Abyss on tap too!).</p>

<p>We ordered pizza from Pagliacci and waited while we finished our beers. For our second round, I got Full Sail’s “Wreck the Halls”:http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/5316/7200 (6.5% ABV) winter seasonal and, to try the last of the bourbon barrel beers, I ordered the Quad Frog (13.5% ABV) for Gay. She preferred the Wreck the Halls and I preferred the Quad Frog, so we switched. I thought the Quad Frog tasted a lot like Menage-a-Frog that we got “at the Rogue brewpub in Oregon”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/01/11/drive-to-cannon-beach-oregon/ last January. It turns out that it’s in the same family, brewed by Rogue only in their Issaquah brewpub (not sure why they didn’t label it as a Rogue beer).</p>

<p>Ordering food from another restaurant for delivery to a pub is a first for me. I’m not sure I’d go there again for dinner, but it’s a great place to stop in to find a great unique craft beers.</p>

          <p>The New York Times did “a taste test of barrel-aged beers”:http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/dining/07wine.html?_r=1, which is a recent trend in brewing. See their “tasting report”:http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/dining/07wlis.html?ref=dining. I’m still trying to get my hands on Pike’s Entire bourbon barrel-aged stout, but I “have had Dogfish Head’s Burton Baton barrel-aged IPA”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/06/11/dogfish-head-burton-baton-imperial-ipa/, which is very good and I still have a few bottles left waiting for a good reason.</p>

          <p>The Seattle Times “interviewed Rick Steves”:http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2003879700_webricksteves12.html on his stance on travel as education:</p>

<p>bq. I think if the world knew what was good for it, it would establish a fund to pay for Americans all to have a free trip for six weeks, anywhere they wanted around the world upon graduation. It would be the best investment the world could ever make. Because right now an America that is threatened by, fearful of and misunderstands the rest of the world is a costly thing on this planet.</p>

<p>bq. I used to think the world was a pyramid with us on top and everybody else trying to figure it out. And I really traveled believing I could just share with people all the beauties of American culture, and I don’t believe that anymore. I like my way of living, but I don’t think that other people want to copy it.</p>

<p>bq. America, frankly, doesn’t know what war is like. We don’t have many living memories right now of what a serious war that the Europeans have experienced is. Consequently, we’ve sanitized it. And Europeans have many more powerful reminders of how war can devastate a society. Consequently they’re inclined to find alternatives to war a little more aggressively than we are.</p>
