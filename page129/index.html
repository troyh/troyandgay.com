              <p>After a week I’ve realized that San Francisco is not a beer town, despite being the birthplace for American craft brewing. Grocery stores have a very limited beer selection, far more limited than even Vashon’s Thriftway, and restaurants have only a handful of beers on tap, most of which are mainstream beers. And if you do want beer you’d better not have kids because the beer bars don’t allow kids.</p>

<p>We drove around San Francisco for a while and then, on the recommendation from the hotel concierge, went to “Izzy’s Steak House”:http://www.izzyssteaks.com/.</p>

<p>Fortunately, of the five beers on tap, Izzy’s had Denogginizer, a double IPA from “Drake’s Brewing”:http://www.drinkdrakes.com/home.html, a small brewer from California that I’ve never even heard of. I ordered that and it was very good.</p>

<p>We went back to the hotel and stopped at the Ghirardelli ice cream shop in <a href="http://www.ghirardellisq.com/ghirardellisq/food.php?id=16">Ghirardelli Square</a> for some ice cream for Havana, which made her very excited. She had two small spoons of it and didn’t want any more. Go figure.</p>

              <p>We drove across the Golden Gate Bridge to Santa Rosa to visit the “Russian River Brewing Company”:http://www.russianriverbrewing.com/web/home.html, one of my current favorite brewers and brewer of the famous “Pliny the Elder”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/12/26/pliny-the-elder/. It’s hardly a brewery, mostly a brewpub, which would explain their very limited availability even in San Francisco. We ordered their sampler, which is a set of 2 oz. samples of all their current beers, 14 in total, most of which I’ve never had. Half of them were Belgian-style including a beer brewed with “brettanomyces”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brettanomyces which was incredibly sour, like drinking liquid Sweet Tarts and not very good in our opinion. Another sour beer, called Consecration, but aged in Cabernet Sauvignon barrels and brewed with currants that was much better, you can really taste the wine barrel flavor. So good that we bought two 750ml bottles to take home.</p>

<p>We walked off the beer by strolling around Santa Rosa to a park where Havana could play. We weren’t there long before a group of older kids showed up to take over the play area and amaze Havana.</p>

<p>We drove back towards San Francisco down 101 to visit the “Lagunitas”:http://www.lagunitas.com/ brewery, another favorite of mine. This is mostly a warehouse that does tours at 3pm, right when we happen to get there. They have a beer tasting in a loft area in the warehouse which seems like a place the employees hang out in after a day’s work. A group of a dozen or so college-age (or college-age mentality) people showed up to try and fail to hide their amazement that they were drinking free beer. We sat on the couch with Havana and Hudson and a few other people to taste their beers. They served their pilsner (great for a pilsner), their “Censored” beer (the Federal Govt wouldn’t let them call it “Kronik” so they called it “Censored”) their flagship IPA (a great IPA), Maximus (I love it) and a seasonal called “Undercover”, which was pretty good. Unfortunately, the last two were served from bottles rather than draft. And they only sell beers by the case, which was just too much for us to carry home so we left empty-handed.</p>

<p>After that we drove through downtown Petaluma, stopped at Starbucks for coffees and milk for Havana and headed back to San Francisco.</p>

              <p>Hudson is 7 months old today. He’s been teething a lot lately and needing teething gel so his first tooth is probably imminent. He can turn over and do 360°s pretty easily but he’s not yet crawling. He’s still very quiet and laid-back. When he’s really upset he makes noises and most people think he’s just trying to talk, but we know that he’s angry and either needs a diaper-change, he’s hungry or bored.</p>

              <p>Today’s Gay’s birthday. Happy Birthday, Gay!</p>

<p>We had breakfast at the hotel in Redding and took our time leaving thinking we had plenty of time. We gave the kids a bath in the morning after breakfast, packed up and got on the road by 11am. We made our way pretty quickly to Chico to the Sierra Nevada Brewery.</p>

<p>The “tour” is a self-guided tour, if you can call it that. We just walked around the brewery. Since it’s Sunday, no one was working so it was quiet. They have a brewpub in the brewery so we went there for lunch. It’s a fairly typical brewpub, and a very popular place in the area. There were lots of locals and a surprising number of people drinking wine. I ordered the Torpedo IPA, a new (to me, at least) Sierra Nevada beer that I really like. It was every bit as good on draft. They have a lot of beers that are only available at the brewery or in local pubs so we also ordered their sampler. Their sampler consists of 16 beers! I’ve never had a sample size that big. I liked the Bigfoot, the Chico IPA and, of course, the Porter and Stout. A surprise was that we liked their Hefeweizen, called “Ruthless Hefeweizen”. I really don’t like wheat beers at all but this was pretty good. Gay liked it even more than me. Another surprise was their new “Pale Bock” which is neither a pale ale or a bock, but a malt liquor. I expected to really dislike it and, while I didn’t like it all that much, it wasn’t so bad. It’s far from an Olde English or Colt 45, though and was not even served in a paper bag.</p>

<p>We headed away from the brewery at 1pm hoping to be in San Francisco within 3 hours. But we hit traffic in Vacaville and it was slow traffic for most of the way to San Francisco. We got to our place in the city at 6pm. We had no food and we were hungry so we put the kids in the stroller looking for some quick take-out so we could get the kids to bed soon after 7pm. No luck. We ended up getting prepared sandwiches at a deli which were not good. Gay got online and found a Thai place that also has sushi place and that delivers so we ordered some sushi and, to hedge our bets, some Pad Thai. We finally got Havana to bed by 8:30pm, the food arrived but we were disappointed in that.</p>

<p>We were tired and went to bed by 10pm.</p>
