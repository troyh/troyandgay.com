              <p>Seven days (five business days) “after I applied”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/03/12/apples-iphone-developer-approval-process/ to be in the iPhone Developer Program, I was accepted. Apple then let me pay them $99 so that I could get a key and install my app on my iPhone. It’s so nice of them to allow me to make software for their platform. Then I had to go through the involved process of making my security key, uploading it to Apple, getting a certificate from them and installing it on my computer and then registering it with Xcode.</p>

<p>I’ve built software on DOS, several flavors of Windows, Windows mobile devices, Palm devices, a few flavors of commercial Unixes and even Apple’s OS X. I have never had to be <em>approved</em> to be a developer on those platforms. I still don’t understand why Apple is so protective of the iPhone and why it makes sense to them to erect barriers to developers wanting to build iPhone apps. I can’t imagine the hoops I’ll have to jump through or how long it’ll be if/when I want to put the app in the App Store.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>On Wednesday morning, Illy was slow to eat her breakfast. That’s odd for Illy, she’ll knock small children over to get to food. Then I let her out to go to the bathroom and she had trouble walking a straight line. She refused to come back inside and slowly walked around the yard. We didn’t think much of it until noon when she hadn’t come back in. We found her laying behind a row of <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=hydrangeas&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=fv27SebOHoKEsAOSwKQ2&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=title">hydrangeas</a> and she refused to get up. We eventually coaxed her up and she couldn’t walk without falling down, so I carried her inside and up to her bed to rest. She made her way out into the hallway but couldn’t go any further so she just layed down for hours.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>At this point, we figured she had hurt her hips as older Labradors tend to do. She’s had both knees replaced, another common problem with her breed, so we knew her knees weren’t the problem. She’s fell down before and had similar, although less severe, symptoms and she always recovered. The problem with dogs is that they just don’t tell you what’s bothering them. She wouldn’t eat or drink water. She wouldn’t even eat her favorite treat, which has never happened with Illy.</p>

<p>By Thursday she was worse, she couldn’t walk or stand at all and I had to carry her outside to go to the bathroom. It didn’t make sense that she’d get worse over time, so we called the vet Friday morning. They said that it sounds like she has “sudden dizziness” and that it’s very common among older dogs of all breeds. I’d never heard of such a thing. The vet said that it just goes away after a few days. Sure enough, by Friday evening she was getting better. She still couldn’t walk a straight line very well and she’s slow but she didn’t need to be carried around anymore.</p>

<p>This morning, she could stand up on her own and walk outside, go to the bathroom and come back in all by herself. She’s still slightly wobbly and very tentative about walking. Hopefully, by tomorrow she’ll continue to improve.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>I’m building an iPhone app and wanted to put it on my iPhone to try it out on real hardware. I discovered that I can’t do this without getting a license from Apple which requires that you log into your Developer account at Apple.com, which I found shocking. You then have to fill out a form and promise to pay $99. Okay, not a big deal and $99 isn’t much. But then you have to be approved for the program. I assume that means they reject people. <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2008/03/14/iphone-developer-rejection-letter-mass-mailing/">They reject people</a> from building apps for their platform?! I’ve never heard of such a thing!</p>

<p>I can understand their approval process for selling your app on their App Store, but they won’t even let me make a crappy app and put it on my own iPhone. And you can’t just pay the $99 and get your license immediately. Again, this doesn’t mean they have to accept my app on their store and potentially ruin other people’s iPhones, this is just so I can put my app <em>on my own</em> iPhone!</p>

<p>It gets worse….</p>

<p>Then 24 hours later, I got this email from Apple:</p>

<p>What?! They really do look over my application and need to verify that I have a real company. Why? Again, this is just so I can try my own app out on my own phone.  Moreover, I’m planning to give this app away for free. Why do I have to have a corporation to do that? What good is this doing Apple? Who are they protecting themselves from?</p>

<p>What do they think I’m going to do? Build an app and to distribute it outside of the App Store, invite people over to my house so they can put their phone in my cradle and sync the app to it? Or I’d post my license key on a web site along with my source code so that people could download XCode and my source and then build and sync the app to their iPhone? And I’d do this to avoid paying Apple $0 for the App Store fee on my free app?</p>

<p>It’s even more crazy given that I can build a Mac OS X app and distribute it myself without Apple’s consent and I can charge $1000 for it if I want and Apple gets none of that money. But giving away a free app, or even selling it for $1 on the App Store, and Apple needs a thorough vetting process?!?</p>

<p>To make it even dumber, they require a fax. A fax! In 2009! Apple Computer requires a faxed document in 2009. The Washington State government deals in electronic documents and our lawyers deal in electronic documents. State government and lawyers have embraced PDFs but Apple, one of the biggest supporters of PDFs, isn’t quite sure about email and PDFs so they need a 1970s technology to deliver documents. Unbelievable. Now I’ve gotta go figure out how to fax my documentation to Apple rather than just email the PDFs to them.</p>

<p>Even after I do all this, I still have to wait. I have to wait to be given the chance to pay my $99 and then, apparently, I have to wait for them to issue me a license that I can use to transfer my app to my iPhone. <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=8658270">According to some</a>, this can take weeks and even months!</p>

<p>Whomever is in charge of the iPhone Developer Program at Apple should be fired.</p>

<p>Update: I figured there has to be a way to email the documentation to them so I called Apple to ask. Nope. Fax is the only way they will accept documents. I asked if I could FedEx the documentation to them and the person I talked to said no, only fax is acceptable. I asked why and they said that it’s because of “legal reasons”. In other words, a dumbass lawyer at Apple who doesn’t know what a PDF is and hasn’t used email in their life said fax is the only acceptable format (to their credit, Apple probably ditched telegrams a few years ago) and nobody at Apple questioned it. I imagine that lawyer then put his spectacles in his pocket and his fedora on his head, put the dust cover back on his typewriter, grabbed his briefcase, hopped into his Model T and drove home.</p>

<p>Update #2: The iPhone Developer Program customer service I talked to earlier called me back. Gotta give them credit for that. And they said that there is a postal address that I can send my documentation to. That makes sense, but I still don’t understand why a fax is preferable to email. Faxes are very low quality copies of a document, a PDF or even a scanned document is a much higher-quality version and even more difficult to fake. Apple seems to think that getting into the iPhone Developer Program is such a sacred thing that they need a big vetting process and be legally protected. It’s paranoid and downright stupid thinking on Apple’s part. They really look like idiots throughout the iPhone Developer Program.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>After Obama’s proposal to raise taxes on people making more than $250K I heard a lot of supposedly intelligent people, generally Republicans, calling it a disincentive to make more money and anti-American Dream. These people seemed to believe, or were at least trying to persuade people to believe, that your highest tax bracket applies to <em>all</em> your income. In other words, they’d have you believe that if you’re in the 39% tax bracket, all your income is taxed at 39% rather than just the dollars within that tax bracket.</p>

<p>Media Matters “exposed ABC News”:http://mediamatters.org/countyfair/200903030013?show=1 for publishing an article written by the brainless Emily Friedman implying that it is true, complete with an attorney and a dentist explaining that they are trying to figure out how to reduce their income to $249,999 so they pay less in taxes! And that’s an attorney and a dentist, supposedly educated people. I’d bet that 90% of the country does not understand our tax system. The NY Times economics blog, Economix, noticed ABC News’ idiocy too and “explained how taxes work”:http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/tax-fallacies-explaining-marginal-tax-rates/.</p>

<p>In case you don’t know, if you make more money, you have more money than people who make less even if your tax bracket is higher. Any time you hear someone whining that they pay a lot in taxes, remind them that they paid a lot in taxes because they made a lot of money! There’s no need to feel sorry for rich people… if they don’t like earning lots of money and paying taxes on their earnings, they have an easy way to solve their “problem”: give money away until they’re not rich and they’re paying lower taxes.</p>
