          <p>We checked out of the hotel in Monterey Saturday morning and were on the road by 9am. We arrived in San Francisco, after a couple hours touring the area in between, at 3:30pm.</p>

<p>Our first stop was in Los Gatos, in the mountains before we reached Silicon Valley. The town was really cute so we parked, took out the stroller and walked around for a good while. They were having an Easter Egg hunt in the yard of the high school so we took Havana there where she saw chickens, bunny rabbits and ponies. We really like Los Gatos but it was still too early for lunch so we got back on the highway.</p>

<p>Next stop was Apple headquarters in Cupertino:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2335407243/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2145/2335407243_ed8f80f96e.jpg" alt="Apple Headquarters" /></a></p>

<p>And wouldn’t you know it, there’s a brewpub right next to Apple called “BJ’s Restaurant &amp; Brewhouse”:http://www.bjsbrewhouse.com/ so we went there for lunch. Gay’s getting sick of my brewpub tour, but when in Rome…. I ordered their seasonal ESB and later 4 samplers: Pale Ale, Irish Red, an Imperial Stout and their seasonal Oatmeal Stout. The ESB, pale and Imperial Stout and Oatmeal Stout were all very good. I’m usually not a fan of red ales and theirs was my least favorite of this group.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2336276130/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3260/2336276130_ed4d0bf811.jpg" alt="Beer samples at BJ's Restaurant &amp; Brewhouse, Cupertino, CA" /></a></p>

<p>I ordered a turkey club sandwich, Gay got a mini deep-dish pizza and Havana got an appetizer sampler of avocado egg rolls, a southwestern egg roll, mozzarella sticks and artichoke and spinach dip. The food was about what you’d expect at a brewpub or even a cut above most brewpubs. If I worked at Apple, I’d be at this place often (especially with their “curbside take out”:http://www.bjsbrewhouse.com/curbside.aspx). It turns out that BJ’s is a chain with locations across the country, but I’ve never heard of it since they have none in Washington (“yet”:http://www.bjsbrewhouse.com/locations.aspx). I may have to stop at the one in Eugene on the way home.</p>

<p>After lunch, back on the highway to visit Google’s headquarters and drive around Silicon Valley, through Palo Alto, around Stanford University, through Los Altos and then Mountain View. It’s kinda stupid to drive around looking for the buildings of tech companies, but I was last in the valley in 1995 or 1996, straight from Virginia, and I really liked it then. I wanted to see it again to see if it was like I remembered it was. It wasn’t. Lots of traffic and lots of strip malls. Still not Northern Virginia bad, but getting there. Living in Seattle for so long now must’ve raised my standards.</p>

<p>Enough of that, we headed north into San Francisco. We checked into the hotel, “Hotel Vitale”:http://www.hotelvitale.com/, at 3:30.</p>

<p>We had a sushi dinner at “Ozumo”:http://www.ozumo.com/. Pretty spendy, but Havana had her first sushi so it was priceless. I was probably 24 years old when I first had sushi, she’s had sushi at 42 weeks old. She’s off to a good food start.</p>

          <p>We drove to Avila Beach and then back to SLO to catch Highway 1 up the coast to Monterey. We arrived in Monterey at 4pm.</p>

<p>Our first stop on Highway 1 was the “Hearst Castle”:http://www.hearstcastle.com/ in San Simeon. They give tours of the castle, William Randolph Hearst’s house, but the tours are an hour and forty-five minutes and baby strollers are not allowed. We didn’t want to spend that much time there and I didn’t want to carry Havana around for that long either. So we didn’t take the tour. We walked through the little museum instead and Havana had some snacks outside.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3115/2333395611_3fd84b867a.jpg?v=0" alt="" /></p>

<p>Back in the car and up Highway 1 for a couple hours to “Carmel”:http://www.carmelcalifornia.com/. This was another curvy road, but not as bad as earlier roads and the view over the Pacific Ocean on a sunny day was worth it. We stopped in Carmel for lunch at a little Italian place. It was sunny out so we sat outside by ourselves and watched the people walk by. Havana had a grilled cheese sandwich, which was pretty tasty to me too. Gay and I had bruschetta for a starter and I had duck and goat cheese ravioli and Gay had gnocchi. Both were very good with a glass of wine.</p>

<p>We walked around the town a bit after lunch. Carmel is very quaint, one of the few towns I’d describe that way that we’ve visited on this trip. We then drove 5 miles up the road to Monterey to spend the night. We were tired and Havana went to bed early so we stayed in and ordered room service.</p>

          <p>We left Thursday morning at 9:30am and arrived in San Luis Obispo by 3:30pm. This was the best drive of the trip, good weather, little traffic and great scenery.</p>

<p>We had to stop for two Havana breaks, in “Gilroy”:http://www.ci.gilroy.ca.us/ (home of the famous “Garlic Festival”:http://www.gilroygarlicfestival.com/) for a diaper change and in “King City”:http://www.kingcity.com/ for lunch.</p>

<p>After checking into the hotel, we drove to downtown SLO for dinner at the “Downtown Brewery”:http://www.downtownbrew.com/new/. The food was so-so and the beer was too. Unfortunately, I left the camera at the hotel so no photos. There’s a Farmer’s Market every Thursday evening, so we walked through that for a while. It’s less of a Farmer’s Market and more of a street fair – there was very little produce, it was mostly local businesses with stands showing off what they’re selling.</p>

<p>We stayed at the “Embassy Suites”:http://embassysuites1.hilton.com/en_US/es/hotel/SLOCAES-Embassy-Suites-San-Luis-Obispo-California/index.do, which has a nice atrium. But at night, the bar in the atrium is open until 11pm and voices echo throughout the atrium, so we could hear the conversations from the bar better than our own conversation. And of course, in such a situation, there’s always one guy with a hearty laugh who laughs every few minutes. The noise went on until almost midnight. Havana could sleep through it, though.</p>

          <p>On Tuesday, we strolled around the hotel’s grounds and had lunch at the cafe. Little birds (Starlings?) were all around the outside dining area and ever since she discovered birds in Mexico, Havana loves to point out birds – she points and says “bir-duh”. These birds weren’t shy, they landed right on our table and hopped around. This shocked Havana, she’d flinch when they moved and they got so close she got scared and started crying.</p>

<p>We had a great dinner at “The Farm”:http://www.thecarnerosinn.com/thecarnerosinn/restaurant_farm.aspx. For starters, we had tuna carpaccio and the foie gras. The tuna had a glaze of -pesto- basil sauce, but what really made it was the breadcrumbs, really tiny croutons, sprinkled on it. The foie gras had quince paste in the middle and was served with a small brioche bun. For dinner, I had the duck breast with caramelized onions, Gay had venison with braised cabbage. For dessert, we split a chocolate fondant cake with ice cream. Havana had a blast watching all the people and gnawing on her new favorite chewtoy: a wine cork. And the wait staff entertained her all night.</p>

<p>Wednesday was a little Napa wine tour. We drove up Highway 29 to Calistoga where we walked around the town. It’s a very tiny town, so it only took a few minutes to traverse the entire downtown area. We stopped to get sandwiches to go and a bottle of wine and took off down the Silverado Trail to our first winery, “August Briggs”:http://www.augustbriggswines.com/. We tasted a few wines, bought a couple bottles there and sat outside the winery on picnic tables and had our lunch. We stopped at “Plumpjack”:http://www.plumpjackwinery.com/plumpjackwinery/, “Silver Oak”:http://www.silveroak.com/main/index.html and “Stag’s Leap”:http://www.stagsleapwinery.com/home.html before we got tired of wineries. The weather was great and there are few tourists during the week so it was a nice drive around the valley.</p>

<p>This is a great time to visit Napa Valley, there’s hardly anyone here, everything’s open and the weather’s great.</p>

<p>We went to dinner at “Boon Fly Cafe”:http://www.yelp.com/biz/boon-fly-cafe-napa, part of The Carneros Inn. Havana had a margarita pizza, Gay had the pappardelle with short ribs and I had the breast of chicken with risotto. Once again, Havana turned around in her highchair to watch the other guests in the restaurant and ignore us.</p>

          <p>Monday was a long day. We left Eureka at 9:30am after a quick breakfast and coffee at the hotel and got to Napa by 6pm.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2327050540/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2180/2327050540_d39a4a112a.jpg" alt="Avenue of the Giants" /></a></p>

<p>We drove through the “Avenue of the Giants”:http://avenueofthegiants.net/, where we went 10 years ago. We couldn’t find the place we stopped last year that had bigger and better fallen trees, but we drove the entire length of the route excluding the part that was closed. That was probably where we were last. We got some photos of Havana in the forest, which was the goal anyway.</p>

<p>We got off Highway 101 and onto Highway 1 to Fort Bragg. That is a very windy road, lots of hairpin turns. Fortunately, Havana was asleep the entire time so she didn’t get upset about the twists and turns. The E-Shift™ transmission came in handy, I could shift manually and save wear and tear on my braking foot going around the bends.</p>

<p>By 1:30pm we arrived in Fort Bragg and went to the “Scrimshaw”:http://www.pubcrawler.com/Template/ReviewWC.cfm?BrewerID=42, North Coast Brewery’s brewpub, for lunch. We went to the brewery’s gift shop for an Old Stock Ale glass and a 4-pack of “Brother Thelonious Abbey Ale”:http://www.northcoastbrewing.com/beer-brotherThelonious.htm, one of the beers we sampled and a beer that is unavailable in Seattle.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2326239889/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3278/2326239889_30a30322cd.jpg" alt="Samples" /></a></p>

<p>After lunch, we continued south for 15 minutes to Mendocino. We got some coffee, drove around the town a bit and then back on the highway. Havana napped again for a while before we stopped in Cloverdale to give her a break from her car seat.</p>

<p>We drove through traffic between Santa Rosa and Sonoma and arrived at our hotel, “The Carneros Inn”:http://www.thecarnerosinn.com, by 6pm.</p>

<p>Gas mileage-wise, we’re doing just as the EPA predicted for the car – on the first tankful from Seattle to Grant’s Pass we got 26.4 MPG. From there to Napa we got 24.5 MPG, probably due to the slower windy roads on the coast of California. The car is rated at 16/24 city/highway MPG, and we do get about 16 MPG in the city driving around Seattle. The EPA’s “new rating system for 2008”:http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ratings2008.shtml seems to be far more accurate than the old one.</p>
