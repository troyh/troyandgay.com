Here’s a video of her this afternoon, but even that’s nothing, she was walking 20 feet and around corners this evening.</p>

            <p>The Steelers are one of only six teams that don’t have cheerleaders. I like that. Unfortunately, they created a mascot last year: “Steely McBeam”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steely_McBeam. And to make matters worse, he was just “arrested for drunk driving”:http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08100/871780-66.stm?cmpid=steelers.xml.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the “Beam” in his last name was inspired by “Jim Beam”:http://www.jimbeam.com/. What did they expect?</p>

            <p>He “admits”:http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2007/12/mccain_its_abou.html he doesn’t know much about economics, but true to Republican form, “McCain knows taxes”:http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2008/04/14/daily13.html. He says if he’s elected he’d:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Suspend gas taxes from Memorial Day to Labor Day. That would cut “13%”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/20/in-defense-of-exxon/, or 46¢, off a gallon of gas during the summer driving season. It’s debatable whether this will work. When prices drop, people consume more. When demand rises, prices rise. If demand for gas increases, prices will rise again. People will get to take the vacation or do their jobs, which is good, but will the rise in prices offset the drop in taxes? And without gas tax revenue, will the quality of our roads decrease? Gas prices are high because OPEC artificially controls supply and Americans love to use gas. Suspending gas taxes won’t affect supply at all and may increase the love of using gas. I’d argue it’s better and safer to encourage people to fly than to drive on vacations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Raise the tax exemption for each child from $3,500 to $7,000. I spend more than $3,500/year on groceries which are not taxed in Washington State, so I get a bigger tax break from buying food than I do from providing for a kid. $7,000 is more reasonable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>End the “Alternative Minimum Tax”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_Minimum_Tax which has been hitting the middle-class in recent years even though it was originally intended to add a tax to the wealthiest households. Ending the AMT benefits wealthy people the most, but it’s a contrived tax anyway and should be ended.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cut employment tax from 35% to 25%, which is a great incentive to get companies to hire more people and be more productive (assuming they don’t hire dummies).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Best of all, he understands that “opening new markets for American goods and services is indispensable to our future prosperity” which the Democrats don’t understand. I still could never bring myself to vote for a Republican and endorse their (anti-)social ideals they are so proud of, but at least McCain has <em>some</em> good points.</p>

<p>In his “visit to the US”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/16/us/nationalspecial2/15cnd-pope.html?ex=1365998400&amp;en=9d9978f9f71de5d7&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss, the Pope on pedophilia:</p>

<p>bq. “I would not speak at this moment about homosexuality, but pedophilia, which is another thing. And we would absolutely exclude pedophiles from the sacred ministry.”</p>

<p>It took the Catholic Church 359 years, in 1992, to admit that Earth revolved around the sun after Galileo proved it in 1663 (when they put him on trial for blasphemy). And here we are, just 16 years after they realized that, that they recognize that homosexuality and pedophilia are two different things. If this trend towards logic continues, the Catholic Church may reconsider its stance that birth control is murder.</p>

<p>Pedophiles will no longer be tolerated in the priesthood:</p>

<p>bq. The pope said church officials were going through the seminaries that train would-be priests to make sure that those candidates have no such tendencies. “We’ll do all that is possible to have a strong discernment, because it is more important to have good priests than to have many priests,” he said.</p>

<p>They’re going to discern pedophiles from non-pedophiles. I can’t wait to find out what tests they will use to figure out who is a pedophile. If they can do that, why didn’t they figure out tests to discover who is a murderer thousands of years ago? Maybe they can discern terrorists too and we can stop taking off our shoes in airports.</p>

<p>The Pope on secularism:</p>

<p>bq. But he said the United States was interesting because it “started with positive idea of secularism.”</p>

<p>bq. “This new people was made of communities that had escaped official state purges and wanted a lay state, a secular state that opened the possibility for all confessions and all form of religious exercise,” he added. “Therefore it was a state that was intentionally secular. It was the exact opposite of state religion, but it was secular out of love for religion and for an authenticity that can only be lived freely.”</p>

<p>The Pope likes secularism that the US was founded on. Yet he is the head of Vatican City, a state within Rome that has no separation from the Church. Freedom of religion is great for everyone, except those in Vatican City.</p>
