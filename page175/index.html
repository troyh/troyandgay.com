          <p>Monday was a long day. We left Eureka at 9:30am after a quick breakfast and coffee at the hotel and got to Napa by 6pm.</p>

<p>We drove through the “Avenue of the Giants”:http://avenueofthegiants.net/, where we went 10 years ago. We couldn’t find the place we stopped last year that had bigger and better fallen trees, but we drove the entire length of the route excluding the part that was closed. That was probably where we were last. We got some photos of Havana in the forest, which was the goal anyway.</p>

<p>We got off Highway 101 and onto Highway 1 to Fort Bragg. That is a very windy road, lots of hairpin turns. Fortunately, Havana was asleep the entire time so she didn’t get upset about the twists and turns. The E-Shift™ transmission came in handy, I could shift manually and save wear and tear on my braking foot going around the bends.</p>

<p>By 1:30pm we arrived in Fort Bragg and went to the “Scrimshaw”:http://www.pubcrawler.com/Template/ReviewWC.cfm?BrewerID=42, North Coast Brewery’s brewpub, for lunch. We went to the brewery’s gift shop for an Old Stock Ale glass and a 4-pack of “Brother Thelonious Abbey Ale”:http://www.northcoastbrewing.com/beer-brotherThelonious.htm, one of the beers we sampled and a beer that is unavailable in Seattle.</p>

<p>After lunch, we continued south for 15 minutes to Mendocino. We got some coffee, drove around the town a bit and then back on the highway. Havana napped again for a while before we stopped in Cloverdale to give her a break from her car seat.</p>

<p>We drove through traffic between Santa Rosa and Sonoma and arrived at our hotel, “The Carneros Inn”:http://www.thecarnerosinn.com, by 6pm.</p>

<p>Gas mileage-wise, we’re doing just as the EPA predicted for the car – on the first tankful from Seattle to Grant’s Pass we got 26.4 MPG. From there to Napa we got 24.5 MPG, probably due to the slower windy roads on the coast of California. The car is rated at 16/24 city/highway MPG, and we do get about 16 MPG in the city driving around Seattle. The EPA’s “new rating system for 2008”:http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ratings2008.shtml seems to be far more accurate than the old one.</p>

          <p>We left Eugene Sunday at 10am. Havana quickly fell asleep for almost two hours, enough time to reach Grant’s Pass for gas and some play time at the park. The road through the Redwood Forest was windy, so it was slow-going, but we got to Eureka by 4pm. We checked into the hotel and had a glass of wine while Havana got a break from her car seat crawling around the room.</p>

<p>We took a walk around downtown Eureka and had dinner at the Lost Coast Brewery. The beer was okay, the food was acceptable. We went back to the room early to put a tired Havana to bed.</p>

<p>I wanted a glass of wine so I got the wine list from the hotel. Yikes, the wine list was about 80 pages long, 20 were just California cabernets. And no bottle was under $100 – they even had bottles of Screaming Eagle for $2200-4000! After a half-hour of trying to pick a wine, I gave up and just opened the bottle in the room’s honor bar. We watched <em>The 40 Year-Old Virgin</em> on network TV and went to bed.</p>

          <p>We left this morning on the 11:10am ferry. After 2.5 hours, Havana was tired of sitting in the car so we stopped in “Kalama, WA”:http://www.cityofkalama.com/ to let her out to walk around. We went to the little playground in town and Havana sat on a rocker horse and watched two other kids run around the jungle jim.</p>

<p>After another three hours, we arrived in Eugene, checked into the hotel and went out to dinner at a very crowded “Steelhead Brewery”:http://www.steelheadbrewery.com/eugene.htm. After six hours in the car, barely anything to eat all day and a cranky baby, the Steelhead brewpub was perfect: we got a big table in the corner and the place was loud so Havana could make all the noise she wanted and people-watch and we could relax with beer and food.</p>

<p>One of their seasonal beers was an Imperial IPA that they call “Hoppasaurus Rex”. It was slightly fruity and deliciously hoppy and the place was so busy, I almost finished it before our appetizers came and watched Havana bounce in her highchair and watch all the activity outside the window. We had a quesadilla appetizer and for dinner I had the Bleu Burger with onion rings and their Monkey Juice Pilsner, a hoppy pilsner.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>This week, the Tacoma/Tahlequah ferry that runs from the south end of Vashon Island to Tacoma was stopped for three days because a ferry broke down and, since the ferries are currently undergoing maintenance (all at the same time), there was no ferry to replace it. So they just stopped running it. All that ferry traffic had to leave from the north end of the island, which was too much traffic for the ferries and that caused delays of up to 90 minutes. The Tahlequah ferry came back today, Thursday, but with a smaller ferry, causing more delays for those riders.</p>

<p>The Washington State Ferry system is a mess. Prices continue to go up and service continues to go down. It’s a perfect example of how poorly government-run businesses work. How did we get this way? The Seattle Weekly this week has “an article that explains”:http://seattleweekly.com/2008-03-05/news/how-puget-sound-s-last-pirate-gave-us-a-creaking-sinking-ferry-system.php. Long story short, a businessman who ran the private ferry system the first half of the 20th Century was prevented by the government from raising fares to cover his costs, so he sold the ferries to the idiots in the Seattle government who believed they could run them more efficiently and not have to raise fares. Today, it costs us $18 to get to the island ($21 in the peak summer season) and the fares go up and up and up and they’re still losing money running the ferries.</p>

<p>Even more crazy, the government thought the ferries would be temporary because Puget Sound would have a network of bridges within a few years. That never happened and it never seems to even be considered anymore even though the Evergreen Freedom Foundation says it would “save Washington State tax-payers $7.3 billion”:http://www.effwa.org/transportation/alternate_puget_sound_solution.php. Why not? Because the growth-fearing Vashon Island residents, myself excluded, “don’t want a bridge”:http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEEDA1138F932A25750C0A964958260.</p>

<p>That was 1992, though, when the economics of the ferries still seemed to be working – even though the government and the businessman who sold the ferries to it knew in the 1950s that a car ferry system was not economically viable. Because the island is so inaccessible, Vashon Island has only one (or two, depending on who you ask) good restaurants, a grocery store with monopoly pricing and higher gas prices. Yet, time and time again, the biggest complaints islanders have about Vashon is that there are not enough restaurants, the grocery store’s prices are too high and you have to go into Seattle to get cheaper gas. A bridge would solve those problems. I wonder how bad the ferries will have to get before Vashon Islanders agree that a bridge, and economic progress, can be a good thing.</p>

<p>I kegged a batch of beer today that I brewed almost four weeks ago, an IPA(India Pale Ale). It’s my first batch in six months. I want to brew more regularly now.</p>
