          <p>After another appointment in Seattle, we went to dinner at “Quinn’s Pub”:http://quinnspubseattle.com/. Gay had the steak and I had the burger, both I thought were very good but Gay wasn’t as impressed. They had Russian River’s Damnation on tap so I couldn’t pass that up. Gay had the Speakeasy Double IPA which was less hoppy than you’d expect from a double IPA. They have a nice selection of Belgian beers and because we’re going to visit Belgium in a few weeks, we decided to get a Belgian and after recommendations from the waiter, we split the “Achtel Trappist Extra”:http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/922/40681 which was very good and went well with the food.</p>

<p>Incidentally, we found <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/04/26/the-name-hudson/">another reference</a> to “Hudson”… on the menu of dozens of whiskeys there was one called <a href="http://tuthilltown.com/QUALITY/baby.html">Hudson Baby Bourbon</a> made by Tuthilltown Spirits. And Hudson is a baby (but doesn’t taste anything like bourbon). Turns out their whole line of bourbons are named “Hudson”. It’s supposed to be very good too so I’ll have to try to find some.</p>

<p>For dessert, we went to “Molly Moon’s”:http://www.mollymoonicecream.com/ for ice cream. Gay ordered a “double” of salted caramel (yum!) and Vivace coffee ice cream and discovered that a “double” is almost a pint of ice cream (for only $4.50!) and ended up throwing most of it away! I wisely got the single of “birthday cake” ice cream and balsamic strawberry which was a manageable size.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Since naming <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/04/25/hudsons-8-months-old/">Hudson</a>, “Hudson” has popped up a lot that we’ve noticed. Our contact at our bank has a last name of Hudson, the actress Jennifer Hudson had a family tragedy and she sang at the Steelers Super Bowl, a plane miraculously landed in the Hudson in New York, and <em>two</em> restaurants have opened in Seattle recently: <a href="http://washingtonbeerblog.com/2009/04/14/the-hudson-new-american-public-house-open-for-business/">Hudson Public House</a> and <a href="http://hudsonseattle.com/">Hudson Restaurant</a>. Ironically, we picked the name because our other top choice was too trendy.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Another reference today to Hudson in NYT <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/air-force-one-backup-rattles-new-york-nerve/">photo and article</a>.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>He’s had a rough 8th month. He’s been sick twice and had a bad cold this week (that he got from mom and passed on to me and then to Kelly) which made it hard for him to breathe with his thumb in his mouth. That made it hard for him to sleep at night so we had a few sleep-deprived nights this week. The bulb syringe was used frequently to unblock his nose – it’s amazing how much stuff can come out of such a tiny nose.</p>

<p>He’s babbling a lot more than he used to and seems to be trying hard to talk. Still nowhere near walking and doesn’t try crawling very much even though he doesn’t like to stay in the same place or position for long. He’s becoming a very picky eater too, one day he’ll love something and the next he will refuse to eat it. He’s starting to eat solids but that’s hit and miss too.</p>

          <p>We had an appointment today on Bainbridge Island so we drove up and had lunch at the marina. It’s been years since I’ve been to Bainbridge and it’s still a cute as ever. I wish Vashon had a downtown area as nice as Bainbridge’s but with half the population of Bainbridge, I don’t think Vashon can sustain it.</p>

<p>Our appointment ran longer than expected so we just missed the ferry from Bainbridge to Seattle so we raced back down the peninsula and were the last car on the Southworth ferry back to Vashon. Phew!</p>

          <p>I’ve had these beers over the last few days:</p>

<p>Dogfish Head Aprihop: rating=3/5, didn’t think I’d like it, but I did.
Great Divide Hercules Double IPA: rating=4/5
Skagit River Trumpeter Imperial Stout: rating=4/5
Port Brewing’s The Lost Abbey Angel’s Share: rating=4/5
Stone Cali-Belgique: rating=3/5
Fuller’s London Porter: rating=4/5</p>

<p>I hadn’t had London Porter in many years and it’s hard to find, so when I found it, I picked up two (cans). It’s just as I remember it, very malty, somewhat bitter and nicely sweet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3459512169/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3606/3459512169_a7c3f713a9.jpg" alt="The Lost Abbey Angel's Share" /></a></p>

<p>Angel’s Share is another big-hyped beer lately and I’ve been waiting to find it. It just arrived in Seattle this week so when I found it I had to get it. On Saturday we finally got Quantum of Solace from Netflix so we shared it while watching the movie, which seemed like a great night. Both the movie and the beer were disappointing. I can’t get over the complete lack of carbonation in the beer, although otherwise it’s wonderful.</p>
