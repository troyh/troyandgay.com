          <p>Several months ago I was given a free subscription to <a href="http://www.macworld.com/">MacWorld</a> magazine and was offered the regular print version or their new electronic version. Of course, I chose electronic. You read it with software from <a href="http://zinio.com/">Zinio</a> which is impressive. It looks exactly like the print version (with ads too). You can zoom-in/out, click links, highlight and make annotations with relative ease. No copying &amp; pasting though. The total experience is pretty close to reading a printed copy, complete with a visual effect of pages turning. I still can’t sit on the couch and flip through the magazine, but other than that, this is the future of publishing.</p>

<p>_Even in the most pessimistic version of their model, they found that it would take about 5,000 downloads to displace sales of just one physical CD, the authors wrote. Despite the huge scale of downloading worldwide, that would be only a tiny contribution to the overall slide in album sales over the past several years, they said.</p>

<p>Moreover, their data seemed to show that downloads could even have a slight positive effect on the sales of the top albums, the researchers said._</p>
