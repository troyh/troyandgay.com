          <p>Microsoft <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,469394,00.asp">admits</a> that they removed the Web fonts (Verdana, Georgia, etc) solely to hurt Linux and the open source community: _The timing of Microsoft’s decision was made independent of the trade show, the Microsoft spokesman said. “First off, the timing is in no way related to Linux World. Although the EULA did not restrict the fonts to just Windows and Mac OS they were only ever available as Windows .exe’s and Mac archive files. Having said that we acknowledge that the fonts have been used by members of the open source community, and this move will mean that they will have to find different sources for updated fonts. Although there is no significant open-source font development effort currently underway there are various freeware and commercial alternatives to our Web fonts.”

          <p>After a delicious barbequed salmon dinner outside on the back patio with 2 bottles of white wine and listening to <a href="http://www.reindeersection.com/">Reindeer Section</a> and <a href="http://www.bethorton.mu/">Beth Orton</a>, Gay &amp; Troy got in a fight over dinner outside talking about weblogs. Gay thinks they’re not personal enough.</p>

          <p>Talked to mom &amp; dad today…. my dad cut his left thumb on a table saw yesterday and had to go to the ER to get it bandaged. Probably not serious but may lose some feeling in part of his thumb.</p>

          <p>A new version of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/bugzilla/">Bugzilla</a> has been released. The big thing is that the UI is template-ized so we could customize the bug reports to show just the fields we care about. Should we install it?</p>
