            <p>Contador showed how inexperienced he is today. The Schleck brothers attacked and Contador and his teammate Kloden followed. They were ahead of the peloton by minutes and Contador suddenly attacked with 2km to go on the final climb. He had nothing to gain, the Schlecks were a few minutes behind him on the GC and they weren’t gaining any time on him since he was right there with them. His attack ended up dropping Kloden, not the Schlecks! The Schleck brothers ended the stage gaining significant time and put them in 2nd and 3rd place overall, knocking Kloden and Lance out of the top three positions. Stupid stupid mistake.</p>

            <p>We went into Seattle today for a couple meetings, one with the architect at Miller-Hull, whose office I really like:</p>

<p>We’re trying to figure out where the new house will sit on the property. The northern part of the property is not viable since the slope of the property is so great that the house would miss out on the view of Mt. Rainier and Puget Sound unless it was built 30 feet above the ground. We have a couple good ideas to locate it closer to where the current house is that still give us one big yard rather than a front and a backyard but we need to think about it a bit more. Otherwise, the property is fine for building just about anywhere, even over the current septic drain field.</p>

<p>Then we walked to <a href="http://www.thecollinspub.com/">Collins Pub</a> for a lousy dinner but good beer: Grand Teton Double IPA, Anacortes IPA, Lagunitas Lil Sumpin’ Sumpin’ and Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale. To make up for the bad food, we went to Molly Moon’s for ice cream.</p>

            <p>Gay’s mom came to Seattle last week and stayed at her cousins’ places in Seattle. Today, Gay took the kids over there for lunch and to bring her mom back here to stay the week. Havana is very happy to see her Grandma! Havana and Hudson also met Gracelyn who was born about a month before Hudson:</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Havana came running out of the house yelling “There’s a penguin in the house!”. It was 80+ degrees today so we thought the odds of a penguin really being in the house were low so we humored her. Later, Gay went in the house with Havana and Havana showed her the “penguin”. It was actually a hummingbird. And Havana learned a new word.</p>

            <p>Contador attacked on the final climb and no one could match him. He’s now in yellow with Lance in second by 1:37. It should be pretty easy to keep that lead over everyone until the final time trial.</p>

<p>Incidentally, Versus’ TV coverage is dominated by ads for Cadillac and Chrysler. I’m thankful that they support cycling and that allows me to see the TdF, but why are GM and Chrysler wasting our tax dollars advertising for products that the world has rejected and is very unlikely to buy anytime soon? They should make cars that don’t suck before they start advertising again.</p>
