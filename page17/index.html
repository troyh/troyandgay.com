          <p>Gay and I had coffee this morning with <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redhook_Ale_Brewery">Paul Shipman</a>, a co-founder of Red Hook Brewery, one of the first craft breweries in America. We met at Starbucks, the first business the other founder of Red Hook created. </p>

<p>I was reminded about one of my trips to Seattle visiting Microsoft in 1996… Before I left for the airport, I ran around Seattle looking for Red Hook’s <a href="http://redhook.com/beers/blueline/?redhook-age-verification=1">Double Black Stout</a>, a stout brewed with Starbucks coffee, a unique beer at the time. I found 2 bottles and carried them home on the plane (try that today!).</p>

<p>In other Starbucks news, we learned today why the owners of the building were so difficult to deal with during lease negotiations for our brewery months ago: they <a href="http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2013/09/spilling-the-beans-starbucks-building-giant-coffee-roaster-and-cafe-at-base-of-capitol-hill/">leased it to Starbucks for a huge local coffee roastery</a>. There’s no shame losing to Starbucks.</p>

          <p>Preston’s dad got 4 tickets to the Sounders game tonight in the Seattle Bank suite and took Hudson and me. Sounders won, 2-1. Hudson and Preston spent most of the game playing with some girl.   </p>

          <p>Hudson turned 5 today. He’s very happy to be 5, he’s been talking for months about turning 5 and his birthday couldn’t come quick enough. I woke up alone when Eva came into our bed with her big Olivia book to show me all the clothes Olivia was wearing. Gay was already awake and took Havana and Hudson to Top Pot to get doughnuts.</p>

<p>We spent the morning getting ready for Hudson’s party.  The kids spent most of the morning on the trampoline. The party started at 2pm. </p>

          <p>We met with the design firm in the morning for a couple hours. They showed us 8 (!) concepts, all very good, and we had a good discussion about them. We left thinking it’d be hard to choose between a few of them. </p>

<p>After that, we walked to <a href="http://www.eataly.com/">Eataly</a> for lunch at <a href="http://www.eataly.com/birreria/">Birreria</a>. Ben Brotman met us there and we had beers and lunch. </p>

<p>Then we all went to <a href="http://www.thehighline.org/">The High Line</a> park for a walk and to <a href="http://standardhotels.com/high-line/food-drink/biergarten">the Bier Garten at The Standard</a> for a beer (where the waitress thought an Oktoberfest and a Hefeweizen are the same thing). </p>

Then we all went to <a href="http://www.gingerman-ny.com/">The Ginger Man</a> for more beers. </p>

Ben left to take the bus back home and Gay and I went to <a href="http://www.jean-georgesrestaurant.com/mobile/jean-georges/about/nougatine-at-jean-georges/">Nougatine</a> for dinner. We happened to watch the documentary <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/mobile/m/somm/">Somm</a> on the plane ride and when the sommelier came over she was wearing her Advanced Sommelier pin on her lapel – she had just passed the test on Friday – and we had a fun conversation about that with her. I’m not much of a wine person but I am impressed with the dedication a sommelier has to go through (and pass!) those tests.</p>
