              <p>I’ve been cycling on a more regular schedule than any time that I’ve lived in Seattle. But I can feel my age now…. when I was 25 I could feel myself getting stronger at least once a week. At 33 years old, I feel like my leg strength has stagnated; the same hills tire my legs out the same everyday. I hate to think what it’ll be like at 40.</p>

              <p>At the end of last week, we rolled out a bunch of <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/">new forums in our Community Talk area</a> on Recipezaar.  Wish we didn’t need it, but glad to institute <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewforum.zsp?f=17">The Frying Pan</a> forum, which is where we will move all the topics that just get too hot, where “all the dead horses go to be beat.”</p>

              <p>_Your (or whoever’s) website is full of misspelled words and bad grammar.  For starters “zaar” is spelled either “czar” or “tzar” but never “zaar”.
Just a friendly suggestion that you have someone proofread what goes on your website, preferably someone whose spelling and grammar knowledge you can trust.  It is much more professional that way.  _</p>

<p>For starters, did you really think we misspelled our LOGO?  Do your friends ever call you “Mo”, Maureen?</p>

<p>I’ve been laughing at this one all day….</p>

              <p>My dad and his two sisters (who are all retired and all live TOGETHER in Spokane) are coming for a visit this weekend.  Last time dad was here, he brought his own food, which he kept in his own refrigerator, so we only ate a couple of meals together.  He also arrived on one day’s notice and didn’t provide a definite departure date.  As you can imagine, this did not make him the most favored house guest of 2002.  I have addressed these issues with him, so I’m hoping we will have a much better visit this time.  But WHY must people over the age of 62 eat dinner before 4:30?  Does not working make you hungrier earlier?

One of dad’s oft-quoted lines from the last visit was when he told Troy and I to “never have kids, dogs are better.”</p>

<p>I tried to explain that “dogs don’t go to college and get good jobs that afford them the ability to buy nice houses where parents can come and enjoy a visit…”</p>
