              <p>Maybe Google just <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/000802.shtml#000802">bought Blogger</a> because they love the letter ‘g’, but I think it’s mostly to embed it into the <a href="http://www.google.com/appliance/">Google Appliance</a>. Google is smart enough to only spend money on something that will make them money. And they’re supposedly having success with this product, selling it to corporations to index their intranet data. But allowing employees to communicate and write about the internal info would be a nice addition to the appliance. I’m sure they could easily sell this to the CEOs as a cheap way to get your employees communicating (read: “working harder”).</p>

<p>Most people tend to think they’re going to use it like they used Deja.com, some even think it’s simply  altruism (Google altruistic?!) and others think they’re just going to start linking <a href="http://news.google.com">Google News</a> to weblogs. And <a href="http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/movabletype/archives/000046.html">Steven Johnson suggests</a> that he may have had an influence on Google with <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/05/10/blogbrain/">this Salon article</a>.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, I’m sure we’ll find out soon enough. And I’d like to know how much they paid for Blogger…  I mean, for crying out loud, it’s a simple database front-end. It ain’t -level of complexity. :)</p>

              <p>I’ve spent days trying to get our troyandgay.com server setup. I want it to be an <a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a> web server that supports <a href="http://www.webdav.org">WebDAV</a>. I originally tried to use Apache 1.3.27 but couldn’t get <a href="http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav/">mod_dav</a> to work – it worked but every GET generated a 504 error (permissions error).</p>

<p>After sitting in bed working on my iBook til 3:30am one night, I gave up and tried Apache 2.0.44. WebDAV is built-in to Apache 2 and it worked right out of the box (so to speak). But nothing else worked… PHP only works as a module, not compiled in and it was flakey, CGI scripts were also flakey, and the server refused to send any images greater than 256 bytes – it gave a 200 result code in the access_log, but no browser got any data.</p>

<p>So I went back to Apache 1.3.27 and everything works just fine, except for WebDAV. Oh well. I’ll save WebDAV for another day. But, boy, would WebDAV be nice. Mac OS X works perfectly with it and even Windows supports it (in its usual klunky way). But at least troyandgay.com will be running PHP 4.3 and MySQL 4.0! That’s probably enough cutting-edge stuff for now.</p>

              <p>Just ordered two new <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/262/wo/EF8AOrHt15b92Ne6DeB1Fwls0WW/1.3.0.3.27.21.1.1.19.3.1.1.0?45,14">PowerMacs</a> and the <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/262/wo/EF8AOrHt15b92Ne6DeB1Fwls0WW/3.3.0.3.27.8">20” display</a> from <a href="http://macmall.com">MacMall</a>. They also gave us 2 free 512MB RAM chips and 2 (crappy, I’m sure) printers that are both free after rebates. I had to up the shipping from ground to 2-day since they ship from Memphis. Then they called me a few minutes later and told me I can save $55 if I ship it 3-day instead of 2-day. So I did that instead. Hopefully, they’ll be here by Thursday, but because Monday is a holiday, maybe Friday. </p>

<p>This turned out to be better than driving to Portland to avoid sales tax because MacMall doesn’t charge sales tax on WA orders and they gave the free RAM. I called <a href="http://thecomputerstore.com">The Computer Store</a> in Portland and asked if they’d also give me free RAM to match it. They refused claiming that they give “instant gratification” and “free shipping”. They just lost out on $5000+ worth of sales.</p>
