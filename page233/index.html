          <p>We run a <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com">recipe web site</a> which means our busiest time of year is during the run up to the big holidays, so our celebrations are always delayed now.  I have to admit, I’m beginning to like it.  We’re going to our friends’ John &amp; Deborah’s on Thursday, so we get to have dinner without getting stressed about making it to the grocery store tomorrow.  We’re having other friends out here for turkey on Saturday night.  We can cook while the rest of the world Christmas shops.  I’ve only <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/mycookbook/book/30270/">started collecting recipes to choose from for a menu today</a>.  Thanksgiving is still my favorite holiday, and I am really looking forward to sharing it with our close friends, even if a few days late.</p>

          <p>We dropped Illy off at the vet this morning to have a mole removed from her lip. She developed it this summer and on her last checkup, the vet recommended that it be removed. We just got back from picking her up. She’s groggy from the anesthesia, but otherwise looks great. Ouzo doesn’t seem to care that she’s back home.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.velonews.com/race/int/articles/7235.0.html">Jan Ullrich is upset</a> about Lance’s comments about him being lazy: “Lance does not know me at all. This comment is probably due to his American mentality.”</p>

<p>Ullrich wasn’t much of a threat in the 2004 Tour but, assuming Lance does race it in 2005, this could be the start of a good rivalry. They’ve had a good rapport before, however.</p>
