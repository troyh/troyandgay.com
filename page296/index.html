              <p>We are trying to get our yard in shape (esp. as it will be the site of our big summer party, a.k.a. our wedding, later this summer).  We spent most of the weekend in various suburban pursuits: pressure washing, weed-pulling, tree-pruning, boring plant removal, spraying to prevent the <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/06/001464.php#001464">dreaded tent moths</a>, etc..  The place is really shaping up, and we are working an arborist friend to pick plants and rearrange things.  Plant suggestions welcome – I <em>think</em> we live in zone 6.
We did manage a much-needed break yesterday with friends Mike &amp; Kiernan to spoil our dogs with a trip to the beach.  BTW, when did this Easter holiday become such a big deal?  Vashon doesn’t have much of a downtown as it is, but what little we do have was closed yesterday, making our plan for beach-take-out-lunch a bit difficult.  Mike’s Jewish, so I can’t blame him, but I was raised Catholic and I didn’t realize how big it has gotten.  I suppose if we had kids instead of dogs we’d hunt eggs too, but do all the restaurants have to close as well….</p>

              <p>Condoleezza Rice, under oath, said she did not know of any threats against American targets within the US before 9/11/2001. The next day, the Bush Administration agrees to declassify the PDB from August 6, 2001 “not before Monday”. The very next day, the day before a big US holiday, they release the PDB. Clearly the lie about the release and the actual release were planned to give the US people time to forget about the incredible inconsistencies between it and the previous claims.</p>

<p>The PDB states that Bin Laden is planning domestic US attacks and that two of the hijackers were in the US. Until now, the Bush Administration stated that they knew nothing about such info. They lied. This is not a Clinton lie about an extra-marital affair, this is a lie about the national security of the United States. Worse, they did absolutely nothing about the info they had. They claim they notified the FBI, but the FBI has no record of any notification. Obviously, the Bush Administration did not take these threats seriously. Granted, hindsight is 20/20, but not even a call to the FAA to alert them something may be planned?</p>

              <p>It rained the whole time, but we didn’t mind.  We stayed inside at watched the 9/11 commission hearings all day.  Despite the fact that some people were reluctant to go before the committee under oath, its existence and the commitment of the networks to broadcast the entirety nationally and internationally makes is proud – perhaps the view of your own country is just a little clearer from 100 miles outside its borders.
I experienced the best carrot, turnip and asparagus spear I’d ever had in my life – the best restaurants seem to open your eyes to flavors you take for granted – at <a href="http://www.bishopsonline.com/">Bishop’s</a> and yummy spatzle and satay at the appropriately named glowbal.  We stayed in <a href="http://www.opushotel.com/">a very fun hotel</a> (they let you pick the color scheme for your room), and counted Starbucks when we went out.  I love Vancouver.  It is three times the size of Seattle, so it is much more international, has much better shopping, and MUCH better dining.  Maybe we will move there someday.  After all, Illy &amp; Ouzo are Canadian – labs are one of the few breeds that originated there.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/MT/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=1933">My friend Isabel chastised me for not mentioning 3/11, the Madrid bombings.</a>  She is right, of course. It has only been a few weeks and it seems the continued success of al Qaeda in Madrid has been lost already in this country as Condolezza Rice only finally appears before our 9/11 commission today.
Undoubtedly, the Madrid bombing affected the outcome of the Spanish election, but not in the way it was framed immediately afterwards. From what I have read, Aznar’s government wasn’t popular, not just for its Iraq stance, but his botched handling of the bombing (blaming the Basques) did not help – reminds me all to well of our own President’s continued insistence of whether Iraq had anything to do with 9/11…“See if Saddam did this. See if he’s linked in any way.”
I’ve read estimates that say the 3/11 operation was financed on $1,000.  It has become very cheap to kill people.  I feel it in my heart that Britain will be next.  This is a misunderstood war, and the Iraq war has handed our enemy precisely the propaganda they need.</p>

              <p>For no apparent reason, I stopped blogging.  It was a slow decline I guess, and then when I noticed it had been so long, I decided to make it an even month without a post.
Actually, it wasn’t much of a vacation.  Frankly, I’ve been so dang busy there hasn’t been much time to post.  Between going from a 3 person company back to a 2 person company, and trying to hire another 3rd person, I’ve had a tremendous amount of work.  Kathy’s training officially ended today, so she is on the job and I’m breathing again.  Let’s just hope that means I’ll think of something worth blogging too…</p>
