              <p>Gay asked and we received <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=50449&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0">menu ideas</a> from Recipezaar people. It took a while to decide, so many things looked good. At first, a couple bread puddings were a definite, but as we worked out the other items on the menu, they had to go. Disappointing, but there’s always other times for bread pudding. Many other dishes were in the plan, but some had to go due to time constraints (we really should have started the planning yesterday) and to get the right combination of things.</p>

<p>Here’s the final plan…</p>

<p>We’ll start with a <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/8877">Manhattans</a>, of course, and <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/41126">Chipotle-Barbecued Shrimp with Goat Cheese Cream</a> by <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=32724">Mean Chef</a>.</p>

<p>Gay picked up some lamb and a rib roast and I chose the rib roast mainly because I wanted some fresh horseradish sauce tonight. So we’ll have that with <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/44995">Sauteed Mushrooms with Red Wine</a> by <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=55655">Just Call Me Martha</a>, <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/addrecipe/temp/index.zsp?bb=t50449p623992">Yorkshire Pudding</a> by <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=32724">Mean Chef</a> and <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/29309">Warm Pumpkin Spinach and Feta Salad</a> by <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=29196">Jan S</a> for the side.</p>

<p>And for wine, we have a choice of a 2000 <a href="http://www.quilcedacreek.com/VintageNotes.asp#Red">Quilceda Creek red table wine</a>, a <a href="http://www.stagsleapwinery.com/wines/00cab.html">2000 Stag’s Leap Cabernet Sauvignon</a> or a <a href="http://woodwardcanyon.com/TechSheets/98wwcab.htm">1998 Woodward Canyon Cabernet Sauvignon</a>. Not sure how much my 34th birthday is worth.</p>

<p>I always have a German Chocolate Cake for my birthday cake and have ever since I can remember. Last year, I had an incredible one that will be hard to beat but <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/18575">German Chocolate Squares</a> by <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=8688">Bev</a> looks promising.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who suggested recipes! I wish we could have made more things, but I can’t make Gay work that hard or she may ask me to cook for her on her birthday.</p>

              <p>It’s my birthday and Saturday morning so I’m catching up on some online reading and here’s some interesting things I’ve found, in no particular order…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.megnut.com/archive.asp?which=2003_10_01_archive.inc#007532">Meg</a> has a great experience with Apple’s customer service. <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/infoworld/reports/SRitbudget.html">IT on $5/day</a> is inline with the way we do IT on <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a>; inexpensive commodity hardware is a wonderful thing. <a href="http://www.kottke.org/03/10/expose-panther">Jason Kottke</a> suggests an improvement to Mac OS X’s Exposé feature. I am still in love with OS X 10.3, but Tim O’Reilly has some <a href="http://jim.roepcke.com/6644">criticisms of it</a> and about the future of technology.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=2173573">The Economist on Google</a>. I think Yahoo is in a much better position than Google is simply because they own <a href="http://overture.com">Overture</a>, Google’s equally-sized rival. Besides, the cost of switching search engines is very low so Google has no real advantage. And I wish Apple would give Safari users a choice of search engines in the search box.</p>

<p>That Microsoft is again <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/31/technology/31net.html">interested in purchasing Google</a> is a non-issue as well. Microsoft is not going to migrate Google’s <a href="http://www.google.com/press/highlights.html">10,000 linux servers</a> to Windows the way they tried, failed, tried, failed, tried and partially-succeeded when they bought Hotmail in 1997.</p>

<p>In my opinion, a Google IPO next year is simply a get-rich-quick scheme by <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/">Kleiner-Perkins</a>.</p>

              <p>Today’s my birthday!</p>

<p>Last night, we went into downtown Vashon where all the local businesses give candy out the kids. I’m impressed at how much effort they put into making it a fun Halloween for the kids. And our friends at <a href="http://www.windermerevashon.com/header.html">Windermere Real Estate</a> once again put on the best show with their “Tomb of Doom”.</p>

<p>We went to the local pub for dinner with our Windermere friends Gary, Nancy, Heather, Larry and others. Everyone at the pub was dressed up in their costumes which was amazing given our small rural community. Nancy, who first heard about our engagement tonight, is ready to help plan the wedding. And that’s good, because I am not looking forward to making decisions about flowers and other stuff women think is important.</p>

<p>I need to get to bed… too many beers and I’m sleepy…</p>

              <p>Another online order that gets shipped FedEx to me was scheduled to be delivered today. After their <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/10/001753.php">last screwups</a>, I was prepared for yet another. And they screwed up again. This time, they are “Unable to locate address” although they deliver things here all the time.</p>

<p>I called. They told me that they aren’t “really sure why” the delivery was not made and that the package will be re-delivered not Monday, but Tuesday. They quickly realized the stupidity of that extra day (without even requiring me to point that out) and then promised twice that it would be delivered on Monday. We’ll see. And once again, they tried to use the “RPS excuse” on me. FedEx bought a company called RPS in 1998 to do ground delivery and “it is taking the company a while” to get the two companies integrated. It’s been <strong>five years</strong>. The federal government can completely change administrations <em>twice</em> in that time period, but FedEx can’t get cell phones to their drivers. They have no way to contact their drivers or for their drivers to contact them to get directions to destinations. What a fly-by-night operation.</p>

<p>Worst delivery service EVER. Incidentally, UPS delivered a package on Wednesday, no problems whatsoever, as usual. Go <a href="http://ups.com">UPS</a>!</p>

<p>This time I’m demanding to get my shipping charges refunded. Of course, they’re not sure that can be done. We’ll see.</p>

<p>On the bright side, I’m the 9th search result in a Google search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=fedex+sucks&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">“FedEx Sucks”</a>.</p>
