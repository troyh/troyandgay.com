          <p><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/">Eric Raymond</a> has decided that <a href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2003-10-02-014-26-OP-BZ-SW">Sun is done</a>, thanks to Linux. I’ll always appreciate <a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/media/ceo/mgt_joy.html">Bill Joy</a> because he gave the world <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vi</a>, the world’s greatest text editor, but I disagree that Sun’s death is anything to lose sleep over. And while Java is not as dumb as C#, it’s still as immature and almost as proprietary (although I was admittedly very hopeful for Java in 1996). I say good riddance to Sun’s overpriced hardware and proprietary operating system.</p>

<p>I said in 1999 that Sun would be Linux’s first casualty but it happened even faster than I thought it would. Let the bloody Windows versus Linux war begin. And this will be more fun to watch than the RIAA fight progress; there will be fewer lawsuits, at least.</p>

          <p>Gay <a href="/archives/2003/10/001732.php#001732">has an interesting theory</a> to why people ask us if it’s hard for us to “go to work”. I never thought about it, but I bet that’s right… many people aren’t happy in their jobs so if they worked at home away from the eyes of managers and coworkers, they assume they’d work less rather than more. People have the same initial belief about telecommuters. But if you like what you do, you tend to do it more rather than less.</p>

<p>My typical routine in my favorite “traditional” job (1993-1997): wake up, bike to work, coffee/email/news, work, lunch, work, bike home, dinner, tv/movie, bed.</p>

<p>My typical routine in my least favorite job (1997-1999): wake up, drive to work/coffee, meetings, lunch, meetings, little work, meetings, little work, dinner, drive home, tv/movie/dreading the next day, bed.</p>

<p>My typical routine today (1999-present): wake up, bike ride, coffee/email/news, work, lunch, work, dinner, work, tv/movie, bed.</p>

<p>Life is good again.</p>

<p>Reading the Inc. article reminded me of another thing… there’s lots of talk about balancing work &amp; life these days and the article is full of that talk. When I was at Microsoft, there was a big HR initiative called “Work/Life” (Microsoft is always clever with their names) that was intended to teach employees to gain that balance. Microsoft employees at the time were encouraged to work very long hours to show their commitment to the company. So the Work/Life program seemed to be work against that so I figured it was an idea spawned by some “HR guru” they hired at some point or there was a lawsuit from ex-employees for under-compensation or something. But at the company meeting that year, Ballmer himself had to talk about the Work/Life program. Ballmer is famous for being <a href="http://www.ntk.net/ballmer/mirrors.html">over-excited</a> about everything, shouting at the top of his lungs, <a href="http://www.stenstad.net/storage/ballmer_dance.mpg">running around on stage</a> like he’s about to have a heart attack. I liked that, actually, especially from an exec at a geeky company and the crowd loved it. But when he talked about Work/Life, he couldn’t have been less enthused about encouraging employees to have a balance of work and life; it was like he was delivering a eulogy at a funeral. Needless to say, the Work/Life program had a short life. I wonder what it’s like there today.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20031001/thegoodlife1.html">Inc. Magazine asks a few entrepreneurs what the good life means to them</a>.  (Mostly this magazine is worthless, but I’m drawn in by <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2002/12/001144.php#1144">real people’s stories like this</a>.) Everyday at lunch on our back porch followed by a little walk for our dogs, we feel so lucky to have our good life.  For me, I think the good life is made by doing something you feel passion for combined with the flexibility provided by working for yourself or in a small company.  When people hear we work at home or for ourselves, they always ask if it is difficult to “go to work” each morning, when the opposite is the real difficulty – we can’t stop working, evenings, weekends, etc.  (Perhaps their own dissatisfaction is projected…)  The next mistake they make after we explain this is to ask if it is difficult to then find a balance between work and home.  Sure family and friends are more important than our business, but in reality our business is our life too, and we’re proud of it.  As a result, “balance” is not necessarily the right word – you don’t “prioritize” one child over another.  As one woman says in this article “I have one life, and it must come together.”</p>
