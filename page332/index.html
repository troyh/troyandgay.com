          <p><a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20031001/thegoodlife1.html">Inc. Magazine asks a few entrepreneurs what the good life means to them</a>.  (Mostly this magazine is worthless, but I’m drawn in by <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2002/12/001144.php#1144">real people’s stories like this</a>.) Everyday at lunch on our back porch followed by a little walk for our dogs, we feel so lucky to have our good life.  For me, I think the good life is made by doing something you feel passion for combined with the flexibility provided by working for yourself or in a small company.  When people hear we work at home or for ourselves, they always ask if it is difficult to “go to work” each morning, when the opposite is the real difficulty – we can’t stop working, evenings, weekends, etc.  (Perhaps their own dissatisfaction is projected…)  The next mistake they make after we explain this is to ask if it is difficult to then find a balance between work and home.  Sure family and friends are more important than our business, but in reality our business is our life too, and we’re proud of it.  As a result, “balance” is not necessarily the right word – you don’t “prioritize” one child over another.  As one woman says in this article “I have one life, and it must come together.”</p>

These friends seem to be on a US tour: Seattle &gt; New York &gt; Seattle &gt; San Francisco &gt; Seattle …and they plan on moving back to SF after Mike completes his year assisting <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=9th+circuit+judge+%22richard+tallman%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">9th circuit appellate Judge Richard Tallman</a>.  Mike used to (unfavorably) cover the Microsoft beat for <a href="http://www.seattleweekly.org">The Seattle Weekly</a> and is now characterized as the Weekly’s “most nakedly ambitious writer ever” by his ex-editor in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312304218/recipezaar-20">Seattle and the Demons of Ambition</a> – I’m as provincial as the next Seattlite, but it is an oxymoronic title…</p>

<p>We’ll just have to enjoy them while they are here.</p>

          <p>I got my <a href="http://www.bluetooth.com/">Bluetooth</a> <a href="http://www.dlink.com/products/?model=DBT-120">adapter</a> to connect my computer to my cell phone today. It works. It’s funny…. the instruction manual had seven pages of instructions for installing it on a Windows computer, lots of diagrams and lots of “Click Next” and “Click Yes” guiding you through installing software, giving Windows the path to the new drivers for the device, etc.</p>

<p>The instructions for the Macintosh was 1 sentence that said: “Simply insert the D-Link DBT-120 Bluetooth USB Adapter into an available USB port on your Macintosh OS X v10.2 and the installation will proceed automatically”. I remember when Microsoft’s marketing slogan was “Microsoft: Making It Easier”; not “easy”, but “easier”.</p>
