These friends seem to be on a US tour: Seattle &gt; New York &gt; Seattle &gt; San Francisco &gt; Seattle …and they plan on moving back to SF after Mike completes his year assisting <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=9th+circuit+judge+%22richard+tallman%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">9th circuit appellate Judge Richard Tallman</a>.  Mike used to (unfavorably) cover the Microsoft beat for <a href="http://www.seattleweekly.org">The Seattle Weekly</a> and is now characterized as the Weekly’s “most nakedly ambitious writer ever” by his ex-editor in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312304218/recipezaar-20">Seattle and the Demons of Ambition</a> – I’m as provincial as the next Seattlite, but it is an oxymoronic title…</p>

<p>We’ll just have to enjoy them while they are here.</p>

          <p>I got my <a href="http://www.bluetooth.com/">Bluetooth</a> <a href="http://www.dlink.com/products/?model=DBT-120">adapter</a> to connect my computer to my cell phone today. It works. It’s funny…. the instruction manual had seven pages of instructions for installing it on a Windows computer, lots of diagrams and lots of “Click Next” and “Click Yes” guiding you through installing software, giving Windows the path to the new drivers for the device, etc.</p>

<p>The instructions for the Macintosh was 1 sentence that said: “Simply insert the D-Link DBT-120 Bluetooth USB Adapter into an available USB port on your Macintosh OS X v10.2 and the installation will proceed automatically”. I remember when Microsoft’s marketing slogan was “Microsoft: Making It Easier”; not “easy”, but “easier”.</p>

          <p>We watched Ken Burns’ <a href="http://www.pbs.org/marktwain/">documentary on Mark Twain</a> over the last two nights. It’s amazing what one book can do for you. He was generally unknown until he wrote <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em> and got critical acclaim with <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>. He wrote lots of other books and articles and <a href="http://www.twainquotes.com/">funny quotes</a>, but nothing as significant. He became rich and poor several times due to his writing and the publishing house he founded, but being overly greedy (after all, he said “I am not an American, I am <em>the</em> American”) lost a lot of money in get-rich-quick schemes. Later in life, he became involved in politics and was always a sharp critic of social ills, especially those caused by racism and religion.</p>

<p>Other interesting things: He smoked 40 cigars a day; wore only white suits after his wife died; was asked by Bell to invest in the telephone but he refused thinking there was no market for a telephone (although he invested in many other money-losing ideas); was the first to write a manuscript on a typewriter; he took the name “Mark Twain” (his real name is Samuel Clemens) from the Mississippi riverboat term for where the water becomes calm (“quarter twain”, “half twain” and “mark twain”), he was born and died during Halley’s comet visit by Earth.</p>
