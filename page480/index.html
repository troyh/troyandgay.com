          <p>After meeting the lawyer, we went to Costco. We got The Godfather set on DVD, among the usuals. Then we went to dinner with Megan at (what was called Bangkok House but is now) Tropics, a Thai restaurant in the ID.</p>

          <p>Went into Seattle to meet with John Bender at Holland &amp; Knight. John has much better credentials than Jeff Thomas and was recommended by two other well-regarded lawyers (Chris Wells and Frank Huebner). It went very well; John is very experienced and smart, plus his assistant, David Ebel, is also smart.</p>

<p>Now, how do I tell Jeff Thomas we won’t be needing his services?</p>

          <p>CNet has yet another article on <a href="http://rss.com.com/2100-1040-960294.html?type=pt&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=news">.Mac subscriber growth</a> with a new total of 180,000 subscribers: <em>…that total pales in comparison with the number of people who used iTools. Before Apple announced plans to replace the free iTools suite of Web services with the paid .Mac service, the company claimed about 2.2 million subscribers.</em></p>

<p>Why is that bad? An 8% free-to-fee rate is good, especially considering the high annual price. Who thought they’d get 100%??? At $50-100 per subscriber, that’s a $9-18 million business. Not bad considering all they do is provide a WebDAV server and web mail.</p>

<p>Consider MSCI’s large-cap index, which will include the 300 American companies with the largest market capitalizations. Without a buffer zone, the index would have to sell a stock as soon as its market-cap ranking dropped to 301st, and buy it back if it rose back to 300th. But MSCI will have a buffer zone of 225 to 400 – meaning that a stock won’t be sold until it falls to 401st, or repurchased until it rises back to 225th.</p>

<p>While the zones will reduce turnover, their impact on fund returns is likely to be small. That is because, when buying or selling stocks, most fund companies that offer index funds just transfer shares from one fund to another. Mr. Tint estimates that this practice, known as crossing, already eliminates as much as 80 percent of the transaction costs that index funds would otherwise have to pay.</p>
