          <p>I just checked in a new httpd that speeds up browsing. It does this simply by not doing 2 joins that are unnecessary when just getting the list of categories and their counts for the browse hierarchy. In tests on dublin, the query went from 1.12 seconds to 0.21 seconds (81% faster). Note that this only affects the “simple” browsing case; not when browsing My Cookbook, another user’s recipes, search results, etc. <strong>Test it today</strong> so I can push it to the live site.</p>

          <p>Ballmer <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-959165.html?tag=dd.ne.dht.nl-sty.0">is clueless about open source</a>. They actually think the MVPs are going to equate to open source coders? Ever meet an MVP? A businessman (Ballmer) will never understand what is about open source that is attractive. When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. When you are a businessman, everything looks like a dollar.</p>

<p><em>He made Cathy, a mom who raged at her son while driving, watch a videotape of herself yelling and froze it at the moment she said, “Shut up, Vincent,” then replayed her words 11 times at top volume as she hung her head and sobbed, a moment of counseling that came close to the aversion therapy scene in “A Clockwork Orange.”</em></p>

<p>I say right on.</p>
