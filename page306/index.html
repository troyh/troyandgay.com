            <p>We went to dinner last night with our friends John &amp; Deborah. John and I always have interesting political discussions when we go down that road. It’s funny how two people who want the same goals have such different opinions on how to accomplish those goals. Who’s right? Probably both. In an election year with campaigns starting negative personal attacks, I wish more people would realize that neither side has evil intentions (grievous civil rights violations by the current administration aside).</p>

            <p>The M key on my iBook broke weeks ago. I emailed <a href="http://www.smalldog.com/">SmallDog</a> asking for a replacement key and they sent me one free-of-charge. Got it yesterday and my M key is as good as new. I love companies with great customer service.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.mediapost.com/dtls_dsp_news.cfm?newsID=238867">MediaPost</a> did an article on political advertising on the web and explicitly calls out <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> as a target for Dean’s campaign dollars:</p>

<p><em>The Dean for America campaign displayed a shift in strategy during the fourth quarter of last year. Compared to the previous quarter, when $67,300 went mainly toward ads on MSNBC, just $2,200 was earmarked for ads on Yahoo! GeoCities, VegSource, SoapZone, Recipezaar, The Christian Science Monitor, and Kaboose Network Kids Domain in the fourth quarter. The campaign boosted the bucks a bit in January when $6,000 bought placements on SoapZone and Recipezaar.</em></p>
