              <p>We took a stack of resumés to <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/2003-10-23/chow.html">Top Pot Doughnuts</a> in Seattle yesterday morning for breakfast and reading the resumés. This is a great place, far more comfy than a Starbucks and free Wi-Fi! I don’t know what it is, but having internet access on a laptop sitting in a public place is amazing to me. And whenever you go somewhere that has free Wi-Fi, you see nothing but Mac laptops for some reason (truth be told, there was one PC laptop) even though they have a much smaller percentage of the market. Why is that?</p>

So <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=64087">Recipezaar is hiring</a> and we’ve already received a lot more resumés than we thought we would. Good candidates so far, it’ll be a tough decision.</p>

              <p>When SCO started a $1 billion lawsuit against IBM claiming that IBM infringed on SCO’s copyrights in an attempt to kill linux, there were rumors that Microsoft was helping SCO. But it seemed just too much like conspiracy theories. But now there is <a href="http://www.opensource.org/halloween/halloween10.html">proof from internal SCO email</a> that Microsoft did fund SCO’s efforts to squash linux to the tune of over $100 million! One may argue that it’s “just business”, but given that Microsoft funneled the money through a 3rd party, it’s clear that even Microsoft knew it was something to be ashamed of. It’s especially ironic given that Microsoft cried “let the marketplace decide” when they were involved in antitrust suits, but now they’re relying on lawyers to kill their competition.</p>

<p>Now, of course, I know this didn’t happen, because, well Troy/I = Recipezaar, but imagine someone at Earthlink or AOL or some random ISP getting the same message…</p>
