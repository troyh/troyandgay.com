          <p>David Strom has a good “article”:http://www.internetweek.com/allStories/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=28700044 on the inaccuracy of counting visitors to a web site. People spend lots of money trying to figure it out, but the problem would just go away if ads didn’t exist on the web. :)</p>

          <p>Some of the cast of one of the greatest movies ever made, <em>Goodfellas</em>, “had dinner together.”:http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/ap/20040817/ap_on_en_mo/goodfellas_reunion Why? Who knows, and if Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro weren’t there then it wasn’t really the cast. I can’t believe Ray Liotta hasn’t watched the movie since its premiere! I’ve seen it more than I’ve seen <em>Godfather II</em>. I remember back in 1994 I flipped on HBO and it was just starting and watched the entire thing again til 2am on a work night. I even own the movie on LaserDisc.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>“IBM goes for the jugular”:groklaw: IBM tells the judge that as recently as August 4, 2004, SCO(Santa Cruz Operation/SCO Group/Caldera) was <em>still</em> offering the Linux 2.4 kernel for download, the very code it is suing IBM(International Business Machines) over. My understanding of the significance of this revelation is that SCO has now released knowingly all the code at issue under the GPL(Gnu Public License). In the beginning of the case, they said they didn’t know the allegedly infringing code was in there when they released Linux under the GPL. They can’t say that since they filed the lawsuit in March of 2003. Now, in August of 2004, they are <em>still</em> distributing the same code under the GPL. Under the terms of the GPL, there is no taking that code back that I know of. I think, therefore, that SCO’s case just went poof, on this one issue alone.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>I loved debate in high school and college, and I’ve started to volunteer with the local high school team.  I really think it is one of the best things I ever did for my education and I want to continue to support the activity, especially since the number of women in the activity has declined over the past few years.</p>

<blockquote>_Shaw and others say that while debate skills can help students earn college scholarships, there are other payoffs as well. Debate requires and develops verbal, reasoning and communication skills, and promotes creativity and expansive thinking on a broad range of subjects, supporters say.  National research has shown that debate promotes academic performance, such as higher reading skills._</blockquote>
