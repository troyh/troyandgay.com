          </h3>
            <p>Earlier this year, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2009233610_webdomestic18.html">Washington State passed  legislation</a> to bestow equal rights on same-sex couples that married couples have. As it has been in 31 other states, a Christian group called “Protect Marriage” launched an attack on it in Washington by putting it to a popular vote under the guise of “democracy”. Referendum 71 was born. A popular vote sounds like American democracy but anyone who went through high school understands (or should understand) that The Constitution of the US was written to, among other things, protect the minority from the tyranny of the majority.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that this law in Washington is not about marriage, it just grants the same legal rights to same-sex couples that married couples are given. So it really has nothing to do with the hot-button word “marriage” – the Christians simply didn’t want people to have equal rights like hospital visitation rights, have access to shared health insurance, rules of inheritance, etc. Besides,  <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_dira.htm">the more religious a person is, the more likely they are to be divorced</a> so if the Christians want to protect marriage, they should stop throwing stones from inside their glass houses.</p>

<p>Washington State residents, however, defeated the bigots and approved Referendum 71, upholding the law. I’m proud to live in the state that is the first to uphold basic civil rights for same-sex couples!</p>

<p>Inter-racial marriage was legalized nationally in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia">a Supreme Court decision in 1967</a> but only <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/28417/most-americans-approve-interracial-marriages.aspx">accepted by the majority of the US population as late as 1983</a> and is still only at 77% today. <a href="http://contexts.org/socimages/2009/11/05/support-for-same-sex-marriage-by-age-and-state/">This graph</a> clearly shows that same-sex marriage opposition decreases as older generations die-off, so just as with the end to slavery, civil rights, women being allowed to vote, equal rights for same-sex couples will come to America. The only question is whether people born in the next few generations are embarrassed by their ancestors’ bigotry or not.</p>

<p><strong>Note to gay-bashers who happen upon this blog via Google:</strong> I am not gay. This site is called “TroyandGay” because it is the personal site for two people; one named “Troy” and the other named “Gay”, both heterosexuals. We simply support equal rights because we are Americans, we believe in equality for everyone, even people who are not exactly like us and we believe the Constitution should be upheld. So please spout your anti-gay rhetoric to someone who doesn’t yet know you’re a moron.</p>

            <p>We took the kids over to Steve &amp; Renuka’s house, braving rush hour traffic and a cranky Hudson, to celebrate Steve’s 38th birthday.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We met with the architects this afternoon for the next round after <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/10/16/new-architect/">round 1</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4081743278/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2491/4081743278_edddf2bfc9.jpg" alt="Olson Sundberg Kundig Allen office" /></a>

<p>It could have gone either way after the last meeting – this round could turn out to be a good step forward or it could be just like the meetings with our previous architects where there was little new and the meetings were mostly a waste of time. Fortunately, it went great. We had a productive 2 hours and basically have the layout of the house decided, just like that! I can’t believe that after less than four weeks and just one iteration we’re way past where Miller-Hull was after 10 weeks and five meetings.</p>

<p>Today, Tom and Dan had three more evolutions of the initial four designs and one was pretty close to what we wanted. We explained what we liked and didn’t like about each of the designs and over the course of the meeting we hashed out some changes to that design. Tom’s very talented, he can listen to us and immediately start drawing and has good ideas on the spot. There’s still some minor details and the exact sizes of rooms to work out, but I think we’re pretty close on a floor plan.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to see the elevations, to start thinking in three dimensions and getting an idea of what the house will actually look like.</p>

            <p>My dad’s still <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/10/31/my-dad-in-the-hospital/">in the hospital</a> and they just got the results of the bone scan this morning and the cancer has not spread to his bones, which is very good news! He’s leaving the hospital today and will have his kidney removed in the near future. I think we have to wait until then to find out if the tumor is cancerous and if it has spread to other organs.</p>

            <p>Today’s my 40th birthday. The government gave me a free hour and the NFL gave the Steelers the day off so they could celebrate my birthday too.</p>

<p>I had The Reverend Belgian Quadrupel Ale (to celebrate my 4 decades) from <a href="http://www.averybrewing.com/">Avery</a> while watching football and barbecuing the steaks. With dinner, we opened a bottle of <a href="http://www.kvintners.com/">K Vintners</a> El Jefe that we bought two years ago on a visit to Walla Walla.</p>
