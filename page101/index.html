              <p>Our gift from Santa this year was the <a href="http://www.withings.com/">Withings internet-connected body scale</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.withings.com/en/bodyscale/design"><img src="http://www.withings.com/images/corp/en/balance/balancePerspective.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>It knows who you are when you step on it, it measures your weight and your body fat percentage and sends it to the withings.com site, via WiFi, where they provide nice graphs over time. And they have an iPhone app too. In fact, you can configure it with an iPhone… you turn it over and there’s a cradle for the iPhone, you launch their app, press a button on the scale and they start talking to each other and the iPhone asks you questions about how you want it configured. Very slick. They even have <a href="http://www.withings.com/en/api/bodyscale">a web API</a>.</p>

<p>Our old scale also measured fat percentage but to record the measurements we had to do it manually and I often forgot to do it. This one looks better and is automatic. I love automation. How long until I can get an internet-connected <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphygmomanometer">sphygmomanometer</a> and elliptical machine?</p>

              <p>Bruce Schneier on <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/OPINION/12/29/schneier.air.travel.security.theater/index.html">terrorism security</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Despite fearful rhetoric to the contrary, terrorism is not a transcendent threat. A terrorist attack cannot possibly destroy a country's way of life; it's only our reaction to that attack that can do that kind of damage. The more we undermine our own laws, the more we convert our buildings into fortresses, the more we reduce the freedoms and liberties at the foundation of our societies, the more we're doing the terrorists' job for them.</blockquote>

<p>The Christmas Day attempted bomber got on the plane outside the US. Why is everyone questioning the TSA in the US and not the security in Nigeria or Amsterdam? But the TSA never disappoints the cynics: they banned using the bathroom or having blankets on your lap in the last hour of the flight and  showing the plane’s location on screens. Are terrorists smart enough to build bombs and sneak them through security but too stupid to use a watch to know when the plane is about to land? Are we really not worried about planes exploding unless they’re near the destination?</p>

              <p>Steve and Renuka, sans kids, and Eric came over for a Christmas dinner. Eric just returned from his trip around the world that <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/27/erics-around-the-world-trip/">he started in August 2008</a> and we last saw him, as a surprise, <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/05/21/eric-in-london/">in London earlier this year</a>. He came back the US a few days before Christmas and is staying at his parents in Bellingham. He came down for dinner with us and spent the night.</p>

<p>Dinner was great, as Gay’s dinner always are, and Steve and I drank too much and both had hangovers the next day.</p>

              <p>Havana has started to understand Santa Claus. She put out cookies and juice (although I suggested bourbon) on Christmas Eve and seemed to understand that Santa would come by during the night. She woke up Christmas morning at 6am, a little earlier than usual, and came into our room to wake us up. She wanted breakfast more than Christmas presents. Hudson soon woke up too and we took them down to the tree.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>Santa brought Havana a wooden doll house and a pedal-less bike. Hudson got a basketball hoop and a wooden car “race track” (the cars start at the top and fall down the track levels to the bottom).</p>

<p>This is the first year that Havana understood how to open a present. Hudson is like Havana was last year and didn’t understand what any of this was about. Havana picked out the presents, seemed to think they were all for her or Hudson, and had fun unwrapping them. We filled up the camera with movies and Havana was getting bored so we stopped for breakfast.</p>

<p>Gay made a delicious frittata and we had that as the sun came up. After breakfast we continued to open presents. Her grandmother  gave her a Snow White costume that she wants to wear all the time now. The kids took their afternoon naps earlier than normal and then Havana wanted to watch the DVDs (what she calls “Dee Dee Deez”) that her Uncle Todd and Aunt Rozanne gave her. While Gay was slaving in the kitchen getting Christmas dinner (turkey) ready, Havana, in her Snow White costume, and I watched <em>Finding Nemo</em>, one of the DVDs from her aunt and uncle. Hudson joined us intermittently, dividing his time between the movie and his toys in the other room.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>An MIT economist used the CBO’s data to estimate <a href="http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Columns/2009/December/~/media/CC9EB727BC494A1BB5FE01E9B71EA036.gif">healthcare costs for a family of four at various income levels with and without the Senate’s bill for healthcare reform</a>. Today, a family of four with an income of $36,275 pays 68% of their income to healthcare! That will go down to 17% with healthcare reform. After reform, everyone will pay between 17% and 23% of their income for healthcare and the poorest will pay the lowest percentage rather than the highest percentage as they do today. People who say that higher taxes are going to erase any gains from healthcare reform are going to have a tough time proving it, based on these numbers.</p>

<p>To compare, Europeans pay an average of 10% of their income to healthcare and their healthcare is the best in the world. The US will pay 80% more than Europeans and still have the worst healthcare of the developed world. Did you know that <a href="http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-healthcare.htm">babies are most likely to die in the US than anywhere else in the developed world</a>, i.e., our infant mortality rate is the highest? I’d bet most Americans would never have guessed that. Capitalism and the free market have done great things but they just can’t work in healthcare – healthcare is one of the few areas that has to be subsidized.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>Healthcare costs are so high in the US that Gay and I  didn’t even have healthcare from the age of 30 until 35 because we couldn’t afford it. And we’re educated people in a good industry. Granted, we were struggling to get a business off the ground at the time so it was our choice to take a cut in salary but, then again, America is all about entrepreneurs starting new businesses. How many Americans who want to start their own business aren’t doing it because they can’t afford the healthcare? Fortunately, nothing happened to either of us, but it was stressful knowing that any serious medical problem would bankrupt us. And we didn’t have kids. I can’t imagine how people feel who have kids and can’t afford healthcare.The Senate’s bill is not perfect, but it’s definitely an improvement.</p>

<p>The wealthy are likely going to bear some costs to paying for healthcare, but it’s worth it, in my opinion. If the wealthy don’t like it, it’s easy for them to become poor.</p>
