          <p>It’s been in the 90s all week. Yuck. It may even be the hottest day on record in Seattle, “it has never been over 100 here”:http://bit.ly/mN1op! But the evenings are perfect for drinking beer outside until 10pm.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3770128413/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2608/3770128413_8d1c17a797_o.jpg" alt="photo.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>At about 5:45pm we lost power, probably because of everyone blasting their A/C. We’ve never lost power in the summer before. I love our gas generator!</p>

<p>It did turn out to be “a record at 103”:http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2009558896_webhot29m.html. It hasn’t been this hot in Seattle since July 1994 and before that, 1941.</p>

<p>We may turn on the air-conditioner tomorrow.</p>

          <p>Alan from Miller-Hull visited today to take a look at the property. Alan is working with the principal architect, who came out <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/07/08/talking-about-site-location/">a few weeks</a> ago to talk about the site. Alan was still in Alaska at the time, where he spent 6 months on a project there and <a href="http://alandodson.tumblr.com/">blogged about his experience</a>. We’ve narrowed the possible sites down a bit, but the next step is to get a topographical survey of the property, including the locations of trees, so that we can zero in on where we can and can’t build. We’re in the process of getting bids from surveyors.</p>

<p>We’ve all but decided the house won’t sit on the same foundation as the existing house. It may be just a little to the northeast of the current house where the property is still at a higher elevation which would require less dirt to move (which is expensive) and would give us a good view and southern exposure to the sun. But close to that location are some great big Douglas Fir trees that we want to keep. You can’t build too close to a tree without damaging it or killing it and there’s not enough room between the trees to put a house. I’ll be surprised if the house ends up being a single unit rather than separate living areas across the width of the yard joined by breezeways of some kind to skirt around the trees. I love this kind of design challenge!</p>

        <article>
          <p>Another Tour de France is over. Contador wins, Andy Schleck is second and Armstrong is third. Contador has won two Tours de France and the Vuelta Espana and the Giro d’Italia – he’s won all four major stage races that he’s raced. Very impressive.</p>

<p>We went to France in 2005 to see what I thought would be Lance’s last time on the podium, but there he is up there again in 2009. He’s the second-oldest person to ever be on the podium. As it has been for the last 15 (!) years I’ve been watching, Phil Liggett and Paul Sherwen were who I looked forward to listening to for several hours every evening. I miss them already.</p>

<p>Lance has already announced he’ll race the TdF again next year for Team Radio Shack and I suspect Bruyneel and most of the Astana team will be on that team too. In spite of his victory, Contador may have a hard time finding a new team next year – no team director wants to deal with a guy who disobeys him and Contador will likely discover why having your team not think you’re an ass is beneficial in a stage race. He’s a very good cyclist and could win a few more TdFs if he can mature over the off-season.</p>

<p>My prediction for the winner next year is Andy Schleck.</p>

<p>Time for football season to start…</p>

          <p>Hudson is 11 months old today. Since last month, he’s cruising very well now and loves to practice walking. We hold his hands and he will walk all around the house and yard and get upset if you want to quit before he does. He  crawls fast and can even start to climb stairs. For eating, he rarely takes food from us anymore and now prefers to take food himself and feed himself. This is a welcome change!</p>
