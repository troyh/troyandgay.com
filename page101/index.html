          <p>Hudson is 11 months old today. Since last month, he’s cruising very well now and loves to practice walking. We hold his hands and he will walk all around the house and yard and get upset if you want to quit before he does. He  crawls fast and can even start to climb stairs. For eating, he rarely takes food from us anymore and now prefers to take food himself and feed himself. This is a welcome change!</p>

          <p>Gay and her mom took the kids to <a href="http://www.pdza.org/">Point Defiance Zoo</a> to spend the day with Ruth’s cousin Linda, her grandkids, her daughter, Julie, and her son-in-law, Hans, and their kid, Gracelyn.</p>

          <p>Lance did okay and got back to #3 overall and Contador impressively won the time trial. Mont Ventoux on Saturday could shake things up but it looks like the podium will be Contador, Schleck and Armstrong, in that order. 3rd place is not bad for a 37 year-old guy who hasn’t raced in 4 years.</p>

          <p>Contador showed how inexperienced he is today. The Schleck brothers attacked and Contador and his teammate Kloden followed. They were ahead of the peloton by minutes and Contador suddenly attacked with 2km to go on the final climb. He had nothing to gain, the Schlecks were a few minutes behind him on the GC and they weren’t gaining any time on him since he was right there with them. His attack ended up dropping Kloden, not the Schlecks! The Schleck brothers ended the stage gaining significant time and put them in 2nd and 3rd place overall, knocking Kloden and Lance out of the top three positions. Stupid stupid mistake.</p>
