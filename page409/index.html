          <p>We went to a friend’s house for Easter brunch. Lots of good food. And it was actually a hot morning in Seattle, must’ve been 75 degrees!</p>

          <p><a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/pacificnw/2003/0420/cover.html">Vashon Island</a>, described by activist Rita Schenck as “one-third artists, one-third environmentalists and one-third lawyers.”  I guess that makes us lawyers.  Cover story of this week’s Pacific Northwest Magazine talks about Vashon’s efforts to be self-sustaining.  There’s evena guy here who makes his own bio-diesel fuel by recycling oil from deep-fryers – “his exhaust smells like french fries” and his operations recently burnt down.</p>

          <p>We saw <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/movies/reviews/movie/1106668">Y Tu Mama Tambien</a>. It was very good, in spite of the subtitles. But don’t watch it unless you’re willing to see lots of naked people doing things with other naked people.</p>

          <p>We saw <a href="http://www.mgm.com/ua/personalvelocity/">Personal Velocity</a> last night. Blah. <a href="http://www.parkerposey.org/">Parker Posey</a> was good, as usual, but overall not worth watching, in my opinion. I’m surprised it won the Grand Jury Prize at the <a href="http://festival.sundance.org/index.aspx">Sundance Film Festival</a>. There were 2 <a href="http://apple.com/ibook/">iBooks</a> in it, though.</p>

        <article>
          <p>We did yard work today. It’s nice to take a break from computers and do work that is more physical. I got to use <a href="http://www.husqvarna.com.au/node266.asp">my chainsaw</a> again and cut off some big branches off some maple trees in the yard. On Christmas Day last year a huge tree fell down in our yard so I had to learn about chainsaws, buy one and go cut it up. That was a lot of work, but now I look forward to chainsawing. Is there anything chainsaws can’t do?! :)</p>
