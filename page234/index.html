          </h3>
            <p>We got mail from a friend who moved home to Sri Lanka a couple years ago:</p>

<p>Thanks for all your messages of concern and support, my immediate family is safe and sound.</p>

<p>Went to Payagala (about 50 km south of Colombo along the coast of Sri Lanka) yesterday to check on some people Chrishani knows. They have escaped with their lives. Currently spending most of their time at a local temple as the houses are nothing more than shells with all their and other’s posessions washed out in the gardens and beyond…..We took some basic supplies (drinking water, medicines, clothes, dry rashions, torches etc) and hope to send more essentials over the weekend. They need chlorine tablets/powder to clean garden well, which is normally their source of safe drinking water.</p>

<p>Traffic beyond Kalutara is heavy going with some concern of a bridge collapsed. I anticipate it getting worse as more people make the trek to help. Not particularly safe after dark but there are armed police and army patrolling.</p>

<p>The near term aim should to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, which will abound in the camps, such as temples and churches, and can lead to a secondary massive loss of life…..</p>

<p>What I have seen is not bad compared to what others along the coast have suffered and described. I am working on setting up a fund for donations as my sense is that distribution of aid is not as good as it could be through existing channels. Perhaps, something along the lines of helping children and orphans, I hear 1/3 of those affected fall into this category</p>

<p>I don’t understand why our government can only send $35 million to help what is likely the worst natural disaster in our lifetimes. $1 billion was given to Florida during the hurricanes where 145 people died. Was that just because it was an election year and Florida was important and Indonesians, Sri Lankans and Indians don’t vote?</p>

<p>$35 million, that’s all we can do. It’s a shame that American citizens send our own money to help when our own government can barely lift a finger.</p>

            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2353.jpg" alt="IMG_2353.jpg" />We just got a Christmas present from Google (<a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> runs Google ads). It’s an AM/FM radio/mood light. And it changes function depending on how you place it. On one side, it’s a radio only, turn it and it’s a mood light only, turn again and it’s both a radio and a mood light and the fourth side turns it off. The mood light slowly fades between red, blue, green and purple. Cute.</p>

<p>The card says “Happy Holidays” in several languages. Last year, I think we just got a card. They must like us better this year. :)</p>

          </h3>
            <p><img src="http://www.projectorcentral.com/img.cfm?pid=2605" alt="" />We’re having a spartan Christmas this year. We’re not even going to get a tree since it’s too much to decorate and we’re only having guests over for Christmas Day dinner. So getting a tree and decorating it just for the two of us would be pointless. We’ll have more lightweight decorations around the house instead.</p>

<p>But….. we’re getting one big gift for ourselves: a new projector! The projector that came in our house is an old Sony CRT projector that is showing its age. It’s a $30,000 (!) projector new and it has a great picture (it’s CRT) but the blue bulb burned out earlier this year and it’s $800 to replace it. And the other two are sure to go soon too. So rather than sinking more money into that projector, we decided to get a new projector. The previous owner spent $30k on a TV… that’s just nuts, he could have had a nice car for that. But it was fun to watch movies on it and after spending the last 10 months watching movies on the little screen we were anxious to get back to the big screen!</p>

<p>After weeks of research, we decided to get the <a href="http://www.projectorcentral.com/sony_vpl-hs51.htm">Sony VPL-HS51</a>, an LCD projector but supposedly has “black blacks”, so it competes with much more expensive DLP projectors. The HS51 is the improved model of the HS21, a well-regarded projector itself.</p>

<p>Weak justification: given that <a href="http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2964">we just saved $4000 on our office remodel</a>, it’s almost like getting it for free. :)</p>

<p>What sucks about buying projectors is how hard it is to see one in real life before you buy it. The high-end Seattle shop, Magnolia Hi-Fi, had only two models you could watch: an InFocus and the excellent <a href="http://www.dwin.com/products/dlp.htm">Dwin Transvision 3</a>. The InFocus was not impressive and the Dwin costs $10,000.</p>

<p>Trying to find someone who can demo this projector, we called Fry’s Electronics. They claimed they would have the model the following week. Trying to avoid a trip to Renton if we could, we kept calling to find out if they had it in stock yet but they wouldn’t return our calls. We ended up going there anyway. Can you find a projector in the store? No. They have a $20,000 plasma screen front-and-center, but the projector room is behind a locked door. We found a salesman (who was in the middle of eating his lunch over a trash can) to show us the demo projectors. We were led into the projector room while he and I disagreed about whether the HS51 even existed. A Pearl Jam concert video (how long can that band milk their one hit?) was blasting in the room and the Sony projector had no plug. While we listened to ten unbearable minutes of Pearl Jam the salesman rummaged around in the store for the electrical cord. After returning, he took the projector off the shelf, put it lens-down on the ground and tried to fit a square plug into a round hole with his fist. Not surprising, he couldn’t get the projector to work even after finding the correct power cord that was there all along. So we watched two other projectors and listened to the salesman critcize the cheap model and praise the expensive model. Then we left. Fry’s has a long way to go if they want to sell a projector.</p>

<p>Unless you can find someone in your area that has the projector you are interested in, buying a projector is a gamble. So sites like <a href="http://projectorcentral.com">ProjectorCentral</a> are indispensable. I just hope they’re right! We bought it online, but we have a week to install it and see if we like it and return it if not.</p>

          </h3>
            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2349.jpg" alt="IMG_2349.jpg" />This weekend was a productive one for the office. We’ve all but finished painting. Gay did most of the painting while I did the electrical work. There’s still a bit of touch-up painting left to do, but the photo shows the progress.</p>

<p>On Friday, we went to <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/136935_frys28.html">Fry’s in Renton</a> and we got a <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/patch_panel.html">patch panel</a> and an <a href="http://www.stayonline.com/tone_probe_kits/1004.asp">electrical tone and probe kit</a>. On Saturday, I wired all 16 of the CAT5 outlets into the patch panel – easy but very tedious. Our local hardware store didn’t have the style of outlets we have in our house so we still need to get those and then I can finish the outlet wiring. That should just be an hour or so of work to complete. I haven’t been electrocuted yet, but I did blow the fuse once wiring a wall switch.</p>

<p>When it’s all said and done, I estimate we will have saved close to $700 on the electrician bill; it would have taken one electrician one full day to finish the work (~$500 in labor) and at least a couple hundred dollars in materials because they charge outrageous prices for 50¢ items like outlets and even more for CAT5 receptacles. If you go to Home Depot and buy <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/prel80/HDUS/EN_US/diy_main/pg_diy.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@0033154841.1103574459@@@@&amp;BV_EngineID=ccdgadddgigijmdcgelceffdfgidgjk.0&amp;CNTTYPE=PROD_META&amp;CNTKEY=misc/searchResults.jsp&amp;MID=9876&amp;N=2984+3004&amp;pos=n04">one CAT5 jack it’s $6</a>. I bet the electrician would have charged $15 or more for each of the 16 jacks – imagine paying $240 just for jacks! Home Depot sells them in packs of 10 for $30, so we paid $60 and we have have some left over to use elsewhere. Our cost in tools and materials: $200. And we have the tools to use in the future.</p>

<p>Savings on doing the painting ourselves? Given that we have three colors, Ron’s painting estimate of $1800 would easily have hit $3000, not unlike his other estimates. ;) Our cost in paint and supplies: $150. Ron’s $1800 estimate to paint a 400-square-foot room was insane to start, however.</p>

<p>Assuming we would have paid $3,700 for both painting and electrical work, we saved ~$3,400 by doing it ourselves. Ron’s 16% “overhead &amp; profit” tax on the work would have been an additional $600. Total savings: $4,000!</p>

<p>Next week, the carpet should get installed and we’ll be done!</p>

          </h3>
            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//paintcan.jpg" alt="paintcan.jpg" />Ever see a paint can like this? It’s <a href="http://prattandlambert.com/">Pratt &amp; Lambert</a>’s new design. The top doesn’t require a screwdriver or a lever to open. It has two “knobs” that stick out to give you leverage to turn it. It has two built-in handles, one on the side that you can’t see that is molded into the corner and one that bends up to mimick a traditional paint can. Both ways to carry it are far more comfortable than a traditional paint can. And the inside has a built-in drip spout – the paint that would normally drip down the side and onto your floor drips back into the container instead. And best of all, you can close it without getting paint on your hands or splattering paint like you do when you use a mallet to close a traditional paint can.</p>

<p>P&amp;L paint isn’t cheap normally, and it’s not cheap in this can either. $50 for a container 12 fluid ounces shy of a gallon. But it’s quality stuff and their colors are very nice.</p>

<p>That color in the can is the color that’s going on the walls of our office bathroom. (There’s a really bad joke but I’m too sophisticated to point it out).</p>
