              <p>I haven’t been off the island in weeks, so I just got “Belle &amp; Sebastian’s”:http://belleandsebastian.com “Books” CD last night. I can’t stop listening to “Your Cover’s Blown”:</p>

<p><em>Hey lady, put the phone down
Cancel all operations
Tell your friends to cool it

<p>“Pitchfork Media”:http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/wearetheworld/04-07-07.shtml calls it the “indie party hit of the summer”. I agree… it was fun driving down California Avenue in West Seattle last night heading to dinner in the 80-degree weather with the windows open listening to this disco, bass-pumping song. :)  This band just gets better and better.</p>

Watching Hurricane Charley from Naples, Florida.</p>

<p>My parents live in northern Florida, so they’re probably safe. And they’re heading out tomorrow to go to Cape Hatteras for a vacation with my brother and his wife and kids.</p>

              <p>“eBooks are selling”:http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,64563,00.html I love this, printed books are a dying. They’re just too obsolete these days by the time they hit the bookstores. And, IMO, cookbooks are even more susceptible to this. Who wants to buy a cookbook of 300 recipes where you only like 5 or 10 of the recipes? What if you could pay less for 300 recipes that you really like? And an electronic version that you could print and re-print as you dirty the paper in the kitchen. Cookbooks will go the way of printed encyclopedias.</p>

              <p>“Kerry and Bush differ on a national sales tax”:http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/usatoday/20040813/ts_usatoday/kerryslamspresidentovernationalsalestax</p>

<p>I admit I used to think that a sales tax was the most fair way to tax people. Rich people buy more expensive things so they would pay higher taxes, right? Nope. It turns out that the tax would hit the middle-class and lower-income citizens the most. The problem with a sales tax is that it’s the same percentage for all people. So if Bill Gates buys a loaf of bread for $2, he pays the same tax that someone who earns minimum wage. Fair, maybe, but certainly not good for anyone. And if the sales tax on a new Lexus were higher, Bill Gates would buy fewer of them. Republicans believe that the wealthy (and large corporations) need fewer taxes because they drive the economy. But they don’t. The masses (and small businesses) drive growth in the economy. The rich aren’t rich because they spend money, they’re rich because they don’t spend money.</p>

<p>IE has 94% marketshare still according to WebSideStory, but on Recipezaar, it’s already down to 80% and seems to be steadily dropping. From what we can tell, the #1 reason people stick with IE is because “it’s what I know”. Other reasons are to keep the Google toolbar because of its popup-blocking feature and the resistance to downloading another browser. But those that switched sure seem to love their new browser (Firefox mostly it seems).</p>
