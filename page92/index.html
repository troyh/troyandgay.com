<blockquote>

Large financial institutions that engage in speculative activities for profit should be allowed to fail if they get in trouble, White House advisor Paul Volcker said on Sunday.

As Congress debates financial reform in the wake of the worst financial crisis since the 1930s, Volcker has argued for fencing off investment firms primarily engaged in market speculation from commercial, deposit-taking banks.

"If a big non-bank institution gets in trouble and threatens the whole system, there ought to be some authority that can step in, take over that organization and liquidate it or merge it -- not save it," Volcker said on CNN.

"It's called euthanasia, not a rescue."</blockquote>

<p>It’s about time we have an administration in the White House that doesn’t think it’s okay to let the free market run amok. He also favors putting the Glass-Steagall Act back in place, whose removal allowed banks to mix risky investing with traditional banking, bringing risk to the entire economic system, requiring the Federal Govt to prop them up or allow our economy too crumble. Unfortunately, the Republicans in Congress are sure to prevent that from happening.</p>

            <p>I was listening to my music library randomly today and heard a song from a band called “The Amps” that I’ve never listened to and it sounded so familiar I thought it was a cover version.</p>

<p>In 1989, <a href="http://www.newmodelarmy.org/">New Model Army</a> released “Inheritance” and it starts like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.com/uploads/2010/01/Inheritance.mov">http://troyandgay.com/uploads/2010/01/Inheritance.mov</a></p>

<p>10 years later, in 1999, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amps">The Amps</a> (formed by Kim Deal of the Pixies and The Breeders) released “<a href="http://new.music.yahoo.com/amps/tracks/hoverin--1081914">Hoverin</a>” and it starts like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.com/uploads/2010/01/Hoverin.mov">http://troyandgay.com/uploads/2010/01/Hoverin.mov</a></p>

<p>That’s a blatant rip-off, in my opinion.</p>

            <p>That -MasterCard- Blackberry commercial that runs every 10 minutes during football games contains these thought-provoking lyrics written by Paul McCartney:</p>

<blockquote>There's nothing you can do that can't be done.
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung.
Nothing you can make that can't be made.</blockquote>

<p>There’s also no obvious statement that can’t be obvious. Did I need another reason to lower my opinion of The Beatles?</p>
