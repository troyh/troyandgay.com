          <p>We got a baby-sitter in the morning to entertain the kids so we could relax by the pool on our last day. After their afternoon naps, we took the golf cart over to the resort to go to the beach and walk around.</p>

<p>Our place was next to the resort but we’re not supposed to be in the resort and we eventually were chased out by the security guard. I don’t know why, nobody was there so we weren’t bothering anyone. Security guards tend to take their jobs too seriously. After the kids went to bed, we had a dinner by ourselves for a change.</p>

<p>I’ve had enough of the heat and sun. I’m ready to get back to Seattle, which has been in the 30s all week and to get ready for Christmas.</p>

          <p>Eric and Valerie, on their sailing trip from Seattle to France, are docked in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Paz,_Baja_California_Sur">La Paz</a>, relaxing for a month after <a href="http://blog.mailasail.com/pacificmystic/30">a stressful trip</a> from San Diego.  They took the bus down to Cabo today to meet us. We met at the marina and had dinner.</p>

<p>They stayed at our place Wednesday night. Eric had to fly back to Seattle for a week on Thursday afternoon, so Gay and Valerie drove him to the airport and went shopping while I watched the kids back at the house.</p>

          <p>It’s hot in the morning in Cabo.</p>

<p>I discovered that I forgot to pack shorts so we went to a shopping mall in the town of Cabo to see if I could find some. The mall was big but very empty of both people and stores. We did find a Nautica store and got a couple shorts. I’m glad we found them because my other option was to get shorts at Costco or Wal-Mart.</p>

          <p>We got up early, got the kids in the car and on the 8am ferry for our 10:30am flight to Cabo. We flew Alaska Airlines, home of the surly stewardess. Hudson was asleep on Gay’s lap when they were serving food so she asked the stewardess to put Havana’s tray table up. The stewardess refused. I had to unbuckle my seat belt, even though we were still required to keep them on, get up and and put her tray up. It wasn’t that hard. They gave us a <a href="http://www.alaskaair.com/as/www2/Flights/digEplayer.asp">digEplayer</a>, a portable video device, and one of ours didn’t work so we asked for a replacement. 10 minutes later the stewardess brought a replacement and gave it to the guy in the row in front of us instead who stopped her before he got to us. She never came back. We had to ask a second time for a replacement. I wish a better airline had their hub in Seattle.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4176980328/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2505/4176980328_95913c109b.jpg" alt="IMG_1352" /></a></p>

<p>The kids were happy and content most of the flight. Their ears were hurting as we ascended and descended and we couldn’t figure out how to communicate to him to yawn or open his jaw enough to pop his ears so he was cranky about that. He also got antsy in the last hour and insisted on walking up and down the aisle. He just learned to walk so he loves to practice. It’s interesting to see how different people react to kids. Some people look at them like they’re an animal they’ve never seen before and some people want to play with them.</p>

<p>We got our rental car, a <a href="http://www.dodge.com/en/2009/journey/">Dodge Journey</a>, which I’d never even heard of before, and drove the 40 minutes to our place outside of Cabo.</p>

          <p>Gay’s dad and aunt are arrived today to watch Illy and the house while we’re in Mexico this week. And they got up early yesterday to get in line before 6am on a freezing cold Spokane morning to get the 2nd limited release of Dry Fly Whiskey for us for Christmas. Bless their hearts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4161733073/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2708/4161733073_99c3de4821.jpg" alt="Dry Fly Whiskey" /></a></p>

<p>They were 37th and 38th in line and Dry Fly treated them to hot coffee and a complimentary ski hat. They also got us very cool Dry Fly baseball hats.</p>

<p>“We visited the distillery”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/02/dry-fly-distillery/ last year. Dry Fly is Washington State’s only distillery and they just started releasing their whiskey. “I missed getting their first release in August”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/08/10/its-finally-raining/ due to the small number they can make so I was very happy to get a bottle from their second batch.</p>

<p>It’s very good. It doesn’t have the spicy or sweet taste of Maker’s Mark, my favorite. It’s very smooth and almost buttery. It’s also not a bourbon, it’s a an all-wheat (100% Washington State wheat too) whiskey. I really like it. I wish I could take it with me tomorrow on vacation.</p>
