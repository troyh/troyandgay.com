            <p>After 35 hours, our power was finally restored at 10:15am this morning. Why is electricity so poorly-maintained? Because it’s a monopoly. Monopolies have no incentive to improve their service, in fact, they are incented to not improve it because improving it costs money that cannot be recouped. And of course, since it’s a monopoly, we have no choice but to continue paying any fees they want to charge us regardless of the quality of the service.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T had a federally-granted monopoly on telephone service in the US for many years but the government finally broke it up (thanks to lawyers on behalf of MCI). We need lawyers to sue to break up power companies and create competition in this critical industry. The service will be more reliable and costs will be lower.</p>

            <p>Nothing to do but read news while the power is out and my laptop battery still has power, and I find that <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/nm/nfl_gibbs_dc">Joe Gibbs is returning to coach the Redskins</a> – I care because I grew up (and I use the term “grew up” loosely) in the Washington DC area. Has there ever been another coach who coached after being inducted into the Hall of Fame?</p>

            <p>Last night at 11pm the power went out due to the snow &amp; freezing rain. We woke up at 6am and still had no power. <a href="http://www.pse.com/">Puget Sound Energy</a> expected to have power restored by 2pm. 2pm came and went with no power. It’s been 17 hours without power except for my laptop battery and PSE has no idea when power will be restored now. And the house is getting colder by the hour.</p>

<p>It’s incredible that our country is so dependent on such a fragile resource as electricity. You’d think 3 inches of snow wouldn’t be enough to knock power out for <a href="http://www.kirotv.com/weather/2746462/detail.html">80,000 people</a>, but it’s more than enough. And we can’t even use a telephone (except for cell phones) because telephones today require electricity. Two steps forward, one step backward.</p>

            <p>We’re starting the new year with <a href="http://recipezaar.com">77,134 recipes</a>! On this day last year, we had 46,800 recipes. We added 30,334 recipes in 2003. That’s 83 recipes each day on average. That’s the equivalent of an average cookbook every 2-3 days, or over 100 cookbooks a year!</p>

            <p>I really have been trying to read a bit more – and Troy got me some great books for Christmas too.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0786868430/recipezaar-20"><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/albright.jpg" alt="albright.jpg" />Madame Secretary: A Memoir</a> by Madeleine Albright.  Finally finished this book that mom gave me a while back.  Fun to read back through the glory days of the Clinton administration, when people still knew how to spell “diplomacy” and “multi-lateral”.  I’ve always loved Madeleine, and now I think I know why.  She is an intellectual, powerful and a woman.  We girls just don’t get a lot of role-models at her level and I relished reading about her story, the decisions she made, and the international actions she formulated.  Role models matter.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385504209/recipezaar-20"><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/davinci.jpg" alt="davinci.jpg" />The Da Vinci Code</a> is a not very well-written fun read.  I love a good puzzle, and though some of these puzzles were weak, the fact that they were based on history, religion and art made them more exciting.  My understanding this book has upset some Christians, because it tells some truths the Church would like to keep hidden (like Mary Magdelene’s gospel) and it exaggerates some speculations and presents them as true, which might confuse folks who forget this is a work of fiction.  I read it in a day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0399149864/recipezaar-20"><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/pattern.jpg" alt="pattern.jpg" />Pattern Recognition</a> by William Gibson.  Well, this was a bit odd.  I wasn’t really expecting a suspense, and after Da Vinci Code I was ready to dismiss the genre (not something I normally read), but outside of the plot of this book were some very interesting commentary.  I like the idea of a protagonist allergic to corporate logos and brands, and snippets of video slowly discovered around the internet by obsessed fans trying to assemble the message.  I just think I’m more of the type to enjoy a moody drama that explored these ideas rather than worldwide thriller.  I think it would be a good movie.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1566912148/recipezaar-20"><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/nomad.jpg" alt="nomad.jpg" />Practical Nomad</a>.  Troy surprised me with this book from my wish list.  I even dreamt last night that we took a year to travel around the world.  With our jobs, we could, which is pretty cool.  A lot of the book is just common sense or directed to the backpack traveller, and I think I am beyond it or already know it.  However, you should buy this (or his other book, something like a guide to online travel) because he explains exactly how the airline ticketing business works.  I was surprised to learn that for international tickets you are better going to a travel agent specializing in travel to your destination (regardless of their proximity to your departure city) rather than using an online service.  Very worthwhile.</p>
