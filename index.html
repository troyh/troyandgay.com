<p>There’s been weeks of delays to get to the first brew day but today we did it. I love that it happened to be on Hudson’s birthday, so I can refer to our first beer we brewed as “Hudson Ale”, which is his name. </p>

<p><img src="/img/IMG_1413.JPG" alt="Title" /></p>

<p>This beer won’t be sold, it’s just a test of the brewhouse and, by testing the beer for bacteria over the next several days, a test of our sanitary practices. We’ll also move it through all the tanks to “pickle” them before they get real beers in them. </p>

<p>The brew went well without any catastrophes but it was a long day. We started at 7:30am and left the brewery at 7:30pm. We need to tighten up the routine and get it down to 6-8 hours. We were also interrupted several times by the contractor to make decisions – I am looking forward to the peaceful brews when construction is complete. </p>

<p>For our 11th Anniversary, Gay surprised me by arranging for Gerene &amp; Charlie to take the kids, Patrick &amp; Dierdre to take Barley and we had a night away at a hotel. We went to Lark for a cocktail and then to Omega Ouzeria for dinner where we discovered Summer, the daughter of Hudson and Eva’s preschool teacher, is the hostess. </p>

<p>After walking around Capitol Hill for a while, we went to the brewery to experience it at night, something we will rarely ever get to do. </p>

<p>We went to Vashon Island for the first time since moving away from it to attend Kelly &amp; Stuart’s wedding. Havana also met her best friend from preschool, Tya, but didn’t remember her. </p>

<p>We got to spend some good time with Kelly’s parents and some of our first friends on the island, Heather and Larry, and met Heather’s mom, who coincidentally knows and works with the nuns who live across the street from us now. Small world. </p>

<p>Sitting in line at the ferry dock for an hour reminded us of why we left. But it was fun to be on the island again and I liked the serenity of being surrounded by big trees.</p>

<p>On the way back to the ferry we stopped by our old house. The owners aren’t keeping it up, the garden was unkempt and dying. One of the huge trees, one that is probably 200 years old, in the yard had recently fallen. </p>
