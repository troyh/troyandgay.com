Eva got her first bicycle today at <a href="http://www.montlakebike.com/">Montlake Bicycle Shop</a> and this weekend I installed our bike wall in the mud room. I put 2 sheets of <a href="http://www.sabic-ip.com/gep/Plastics/en/ProductsAndServices/ProductLine/lexan.html">Lexan</a> on the wall to protect it from wet/dirty tires and mounted 5 hooks to hold the bikes and keep them out of the way.</p>

<p>The kids are amazed that the bikes “stick” to the wall.</p>

            <p>Today is Hudson’s half-birthday, a good excuse for dessert! His school class celebrates half-birthdays for the kids whose birthday occurs during the summer so he had his birthday celebration at school this week too.</p>

<p>He helped to make the peanut butter frosting for his half-cake:</p>

<p>It feels like he just <a href="http://troyandgay.com/our%20life/2014/08/25/happy-birthday-hudson-5.html">turned 6</a> and now he’s halfway to 7 already.</p>

<p>Gay decided to take the kids to Spokane to surprise her mom for her 75th birthday this weekend. That meant me and Barley had some quality time together. Being a thoughtful wife, Gay discovered <a href="http://munchery.com">Munchery</a> and had dinner delivered to me Friday and Saturday night. Here’s Friday night’s dinner, eggplant Parmesan, roasted tomato soup, a coconut cream pie for dessert, plus a snickerdoodle cookie:</p>

<p>All I had to do was heat everything up and eat. It was amazing.</p>

<p>Since I’d be without the kids on the weekend, I time-shifted my Friday to Saturday and brewed a batch of beer on Saturday. I finished just as Munchery was delivering my Saturday dinner. I ate dinner and spent the rest of the evening watching movies with Barley. Here’s Barley enjoying our time together:</p>
