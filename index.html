          <p>Of all the shoes to choose from, Havana picked purple <a href="http://www.drmartens.com/us/">Dr Martens</a> boots. How is she so cool at 7?! Here she is modeling them with Eva, who is proud of her new boots too:</p>

<p><img src="/img/IMG_4940.JPG" alt="Title" /></p>

<p>Yes, Eva does like to wear her skirts pulled up high in front, we only ask her to cover her butt in the back.</p>

          <p>Havana and Hudson recently learned to ride their bikes without training wheels.They’ve been riding with just one training wheel for a while and several weeks ago felt confident enough to ask me to take the other wheel off. I did, but we’re both frustrated by the difficulty.</p>

<p>Then, Hudson went with me to the bike shop so I could get some patch kits and he wanted a water bottle “like the Tour de France riders have”. I told him he could get one when he learns to ride his bike. That became the motivation for him. He immediately started trying to ride his bike in the basement. He had some success right away and that (plus some encouragement) got him through about an hour of frustrating falling down. By dinner time he was doing loops around the basement and was very proud of himself.</p>

<video src="/video/IMG_0007.mp4" width="700" autoplay="" controls=""></video>

<p>Havana saw him riding and was excited for him — he was less encouraging of her as she learned over the next couple days. She went out with me and Hudson for a couple nights as I walked Barley and Hudson  rode his bike. Like Hudson, the switch turned on suddenly and she was riding too!</p>

<p>One of my earliest memories is learning to ride a bike. That free feeling from riding a bike for the first time is something I haven’t forgotten and what I see in the kids today. It’s fun to see how excited and proud they get at their accomplishment, which I guess is the payoff of parenthood.</p>

          <p>I took Hudson to the Huskies game today. He couldn’t see when everyone stood up and was “overheating” in the sun. He made it to halftime before a bathroom break, a pretzel and a cupcake. We spent the 2nd half on the concourse in the shade. Huskies lost 20-13 but it was a close game. </p>

<p>After the game, Chloe came to babysit and Gay and I went out to dinner at <a href="http://terraplata.com/">Terra Plata</a> before a great talk by <a href="http://robertreich.org/">Robert Reich</a> at <a href="http://www.townhallseattle.org/">Town Hall</a>.</p>
