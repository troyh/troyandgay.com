          </h3>
            <p>Hudson is 11 months old today. Since last month, he’s cruising very well now and loves to practice walking. We hold his hands and he will walk all around the house and yard and get upset if you want to quit before he does. He  crawls fast and can even start to climb stairs. For eating, he rarely takes food from us anymore and now prefers to take food himself and feed himself. This is a welcome change!</p>

            <p>Gay and her mom took the kids to <a href="http://www.pdza.org/">Point Defiance Zoo</a> to spend the day with Ruth’s cousin Linda, her grandkids, her daughter, Julie, and her son-in-law, Hans, and their kid, Gracelyn.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Lance did okay and got back to #3 overall and Contador impressively won the time trial. Mont Ventoux on Saturday could shake things up but it looks like the podium will be Contador, Schleck and Armstrong, in that order. 3rd place is not bad for a 37 year-old guy who hasn’t raced in 4 years.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Contador showed how inexperienced he is today. The Schleck brothers attacked and Contador and his teammate Kloden followed. They were ahead of the peloton by minutes and Contador suddenly attacked with 2km to go on the final climb. He had nothing to gain, the Schlecks were a few minutes behind him on the GC and they weren’t gaining any time on him since he was right there with them. His attack ended up dropping Kloden, not the Schlecks! The Schleck brothers ended the stage gaining significant time and put them in 2nd and 3rd place overall, knocking Kloden and Lance out of the top three positions. Stupid stupid mistake.</p>

            <p>We went into Seattle today for a couple meetings, one with the architect at Miller-Hull, whose office I really like:</p>

<p>We’re trying to figure out where the new house will sit on the property. The northern part of the property is not viable since the slope of the property is so great that the house would miss out on the view of Mt. Rainier and Puget Sound unless it was built 30 feet above the ground. We have a couple good ideas to locate it closer to where the current house is that still give us one big yard rather than a front and a backyard but we need to think about it a bit more. Otherwise, the property is fine for building just about anywhere, even over the current septic drain field.</p>

<p>Then we walked to <a href="http://www.thecollinspub.com/">Collins Pub</a> for a lousy dinner but good beer: Grand Teton Double IPA, Anacortes IPA, Lagunitas Lil Sumpin’ Sumpin’ and Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale. To make up for the bad food, we went to Molly Moon’s for ice cream.</p>
