            <p>I did a poor job of parallel parking recently, and due to the height of my SUV, I ended up putting a two-inch scratch in the <em>plastic</em> strip of someone’s 1990 Acura Integra GS Hatchback front bumper, which had many other previous bumper scratches and over 200,000 miles, as well as 6 accidents already registered on the VIN number.  Why do I know so much about the car?  I politely left a note – mostly out of guilt because there is just no way this person would have even noticed the scratches, not even next summer when they next washed it – and this person decided this would be a wonderful way to get their next vacation paid for.  They took the car to two body shops who both provided an estimate of more than the trade-in value of the car ($600)!  Naturally, when I offered to make the check out to the repair shop, this person was naturally confused.  We decided on a much smaller check made out directly to them.
If this had happened to me, I would have rejoiced at the fact that there was still good will in the world (and my car is actually still worth a couple of grand), called them and thanked them for their sincerity, told them to forget about it.  Had I been treated <em>that way</em>, I probably would have insisted on sending them $50 or something for a dinner out, instead of having to go through this haggling which ultimately teaches you not to be a nice guy.
I would have expected a lot more from a Seattle acupuncturist, but the new age-y ones seem to always be the least giving or understanding.  Thanks for the new impression of humanity…</p>

            <p>What if, instead of allowing gay marriages, San Francisco put a moratorium on heterosexual marriages because of the inherent unfairness in the law that provides the right to only some.  I tend to think the courts would take the issue up more quickly (when bridezillas start whining), the issue would be framed in a more appropriate discourse (rather than the old “trot out the gay people to stare at on national news each night”), and there is probably a much better legal avenue this way as well (as <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2095955/">argued by Slate</a>).  The city has not right to create laws which are strictly a state domain (as marriage is); however, there is plenty of precedent for localities to object to and NOT enforce state or federal laws.  The real civil disobedience is to not allow straight marriage because it is discriminatory.</p>

<p>Like everyone (who is rational and humane), I am appalled and scared at the President’s call for a constitutional amendment discriminating against gay people.  I hope it brings his “compassionate conservatism”  BS to an end.  We run a site comprised of folks up and down the political spectrum, and I was pretty pleased not only at the rational debate our members had on this issue, but that even most of the most conservatives didn’t think a constitutional amendment discriminating against people was a good idea.  Marriage is, after all, about love.  (I’ve argued in the past for <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/07/001552.php">privatizing marriage</a>, which I still think is a good idea.)</p>

<p>Crikey, we couldn’t pass the Equal Rights Amendment after TWELVE years….</p>
