              <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/alicia-01.jpg" alt="alicia-01.jpg" />Karen and her daughter, <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/alicia.html">Alicia</a>, arrived last night. We’ve been working with Karen all day (she gets up <em>very</em> early) and Alicia’s been playing with the dog, watching TV, browsing the web, and hopefully not getting too bored. Karen’s as nice as we expected, and even more down-to-earth than we expected. Alicia is an adorable girl who is the friendliest and well-adjusted “almost 14 year old” girl I know. What’s striking is the relationship Karen &amp; Alicia have (and they’d probably be embarrassed if they read this)… Alicia clearly loves her mom and they are simply good friends joking with each other all the time. Maybe I shouldn’t be so terrified of having a teenager?</p>

              <p>The FedEx delivery came back this morning and I talked to them (actually a woman). She said she didn’t realize that the doorbell was a doorbell. It’s a button, and the only button, next to the door. What else would it be?</p>

<p>And I still don’t understand why my signature-on-file indicating my authorization to leave packages at the doorstep applies to FedEx Express but not to FedEx Ground. Why does the transportation type determine whether I want packages left at my doorstep?</p>

<p>It’s a shame that it took just as long to travel the 600 miles from Sacramento to Seattle as it did to travel the 5 miles from Seattle to our house. But I got my package.</p>

              <p>Hmmm…. it seems that the US military is a <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/story.jsp?story=452375">bunch</a> of <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/story.jsp?story=452375">jerks</a>. Reminds me of the recent PBS <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/truth/">Frontline</a> that showed the military crushing an Iraqi’s car because he was looting. It turned out that he was a taxi driver and he was carrying wood on top of it, presumably to rebuild his war-damaged house. But the GIs sure had a ball  destroying his car and playing it up to the camera while he watched.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>I was expecting a FedEx delivery today. At 3pm our dogs barked [Note: the dogs were <strong>inside</strong> the house, not outside] which usually means someone drove up to the house. I looked out the window to see the FedEx truck driving away so I went to the door to pick up my package. Nothing. There was a sticker on the door, no more than 2 feet from the doorbell, that said no one was at home to deliver the package so they left and will retry tomorrow. He didn’t ring the doorbell or knock. He just left.</p>

<p>He did the same thing last week. Fortunately, we are having our house painted and the painter happened to catch him as he was leaving and he explained that we were at home. We’re <em>always</em> at home.</p>

<p>So I called FedEx to complain and told them that we’ve never had a problem with FedEx deliveries in the past and that our signature was on file so they could leave packages when we weren’t home so he should have just left it. I was told that FedEx just bought a company called “RPS” (by “just” she meant <a href="http://milwaukee.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2000/03/13/story5.html">5 years ago</a>) and that part of the contract with RPS was that RPS would not abide by FedEx’s policies (such as leaving packages), their computers would not be connected to FedEx’s computers, they had no way of contacting the local delivery people or the driver. Strange, I don’t remember getting the fax or email that announced FedEx had bought a delivery company and that everything would be different. I guess I need to keep more up-to-date with the corporate doings of FedEx in order to be a good customer of theirs. Idiots. I commented that the left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing and she replied “Yes, exactly”.</p>

<p>I finally got through to a dispatcher who promised to call me back when he knew more details. 90 minutes later, no call. I called again, explained the situation, sat on hold and then was told that the driver was too far away now and I’d have to wait til tomorrow. I have to wait because the moron doesn’t know how to ring a doorbell! And why won’t he do the same thing tomorrow? Or next week when I get another delivery? These are the questions I asked and it was suggested that I make a sign and put it on the front door for FedEx that says that we’re home and that he should ring the doorbell. That assumes that the delivery guy can read, of course. Funny that I don’t have to do that for either UPS or Airborne.</p>

<p>[](http://www.google.com/search?q=fedex+sucks&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8).</p>

<p>By the way, FedEx Home Delivery’s web tracking also sucks. They never update it, so you see the 1st item and then when it’s delivered (or not), you see all the days between today and the day it shipped. And worse, they don’t give you a URL, it’s a form POST so to track your shipment you have to repeatedly enter the 92-digit tracking number into their form. Idiots2.</p>

              <p>We <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=48759">announced</a> that we are hiring our first employee at <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a>! After surviving the dot-com crash and working day &amp; night (&amp; weekends) to build and maintain the site for very little financial reward, it’s gratifying to finally be able to hire someone to handle the day-to-day work it requires. We’re very excited that we will finally be able to focus our attention on the part we’re best at (software) and hand over the reins to someone who is perfectly-qualified to handle the part we’re not good at. Years from now I believe we will look back at this as a pivotal event in our history.</p>
