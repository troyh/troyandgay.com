            <p>We finally saw <a href="http://wilcofilm.com/">I’m Trying To Break Your Heart</a>, a movie about the making of <a href="http://www.wilcoworld.net/">Wilco</a>’s <a href="http://www.wilcoworld.net/records/yhf.html">Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</a> album. <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em> is my pick for 2002 album of the year. This album is especially notable because their record label dropped them after hearing the album calling it a “career-ending record” and claiming it was unmarketable. While trying to find a new label to distribute the record, they posted the album on their web site for free and it began to spread. After a year, a new label picked them up and it was released in April 2002. <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=2043926&amp;cf=">Rolling Stone</a> called it the “Album of the Year” and it’s widely-regarded as their best album to date.</p>

<p>It just goes to show that the people who control the music we listen to are clueless. And thanks to the Internet, good bands now have a way to get heard.</p>

<p>But the movie could have been better. It glossed over the rift that caused a member to be asked to leave. And it had more live footage of their shows than it did of studio time. I always find it fascinating to watch musicians create songs. The creative process – the sometimes haphazard decisions mixed with the careful thought – that goes into making great songs is fun to watch. But this movie lacked most of that. And it stopped right when the band got re-signed, rather than show the reaction of the fans and media to the album. I think that would have made a better film and made the truth about the recording industry’s misunderstanding of its own market more evident.</p>

            <p>The term “soap opera” came from Procter &amp; Gamble’s idea to create day-time television shows as vehicles to advertise cleaning products to women.</p>

<p>Also, the other day, I learned that Soft Cell’s <a href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~harel/cgi/page/htmlit?Tainted_Love.html">Tainted Love</a> is not an original song, it is a remake of <a href="http://www.coversproject.com/artist/Gloria%20Jones">Gloria Jones</a>’ <em>Tainted Love</em>.</p>

            <p>Orrin Hatch is <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1028_3-1018845.html">slightly backpedaling</a> from his stance the other day where he said <a href="/archives/2003/06/001483.php#001483">he wants to destroy the computers</a> of anyone who violates copyrights.</p>

<p>Just to put this in perspective, Orrin Hatch thinks it would be perfectly okay for Recipezaar to destroy the computer of anyone who we think may have passed one of our recipes to a friend without our consent. And, of course, we are always right, right? It would be perfectly legal for us to simply destroy anyone’s computer for any reason, we’d just have to say “Hey, they printed a copy of our recipe, surely someone else saw it and that’s a copyright violation!”. But we’re good people, so we wouldn’t do that. But if we were a multi-billion-dollar faceless heartless corporation, we could easily hire 5 employees to “protect our copyrights” and destroy computers willy-nilly – it’s far easier and cheaper to just destroy many computers you suspect of violating copyrights than it is to investigate each case (and corporations <em>always</em> do what is easiest and cheapest). And, with legislation backing us, there’s nothing you could do about it if we were wrong.</p>

<p>The scariest thing of all is that Orrin Hatch doesn’t see the problem at all. It makes perfect sense to him. Fortunately, Orrin Hatch is a technology neophyte so what he proposes is impossible. Right now, at least.</p>

At least the Rosenberg’s stood trial in the hysteria of anti-Communism; the hundreds of “terrorists” in Guantanemo Bay are not provided the same privilege.</p>
