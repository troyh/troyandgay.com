            <p>Last October, I <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/10/001753.php">posted</a> about my frustrations with FedEx. That post is very high, currently 7th, in Google’s results for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=fedex+sucks&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">“fedex sucks”</a> so I get a lot of comments on it from other frustrated FedEx customers. But even more interesting is that several FedEx employees have posted explaining their side of the story. Very interesting.</p>

<p>And again, I say: I love the web!</p>

            <p><a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/163536_msftsco07.html">Microsoft denies</a> they are funding <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2004/03/001923.php#001923">SCO’s lawsuits against linux</a>. Good news, but Microsoft has a tendency to lie in their denials, specifically the recent (but considerably less significant) <a href="http://www.toiletmuseum.com/iloo.html">iLoo</a> and their <a href="http://www.macmerc.com/article.php?sid=374">faked “Switch story”</a>. I’m sure the truth will be revealed eventually.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> There are now reports that the SEC is investigating Microsoft and SCO for “under-the-table” financial dealings.</p>

            <p>Just finished watching <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/CapturingtheFriedmans-1123004/">Capturing the Friedmans</a>. What a waste of 2 hours. It’s a documentary on a father and son accused of pedophilia filmed by the other son through home videos. It’s got all the hallmarks of a “wrongful-conviction-in-puritanical-America-run-by-eager-to-convict-police”, but near the end we find out that he actually is a pedophile and got away with it years before. There was a point where the son’s lawyer told him that his father, interviewing him in jail, asked to move to a different table because the 5 year old boy bouncing on his dad’s knee at the next table was “arousing him”. The moviemaker-in-denial son said to that, “What does aroused mean? If you rub up against a tree and you get aroused, that doesn’t mean you’re a pedophile. That statement [by my father] means nothing.” Yeah… if I tell you that the steak on the grill makes my mouth water and I’ve been known to eat steak in the past, there’s really no sign at all that I may not be a vegetarian.</p>

<p>And then the son goes to trial and admits to molesting children, breaking down in tears, blaming his father for causing it by molesting him and apologizing for molesting children himself. Huh?  You do this in court when you’re innocent? Which story are we to believe: The one where you stoically say you’re innocent or the one where you show emotion and admit your guilt?</p>

<p>So we’re supposed to feel sympathy for a pedophile because he <em>may</em> not have molested the children that came to his house for computer classes, although he did molest children in the past? Where’s the documentary about those children he did molest? In addition to the current MPAA rating system, we need a “Bleeding Heart Liberal, No one is ever guilty” rating so I can avoid this drivel. After seeing this movie, I can only say that I feel even more sympathy for the people who truly are innocent and wrongfully-convicted because their stories are not being heard while this unworthy movie is getting all the attention (it was <a href="http://www.oscar.com/nominees/nom_33105.html">nominated for an Oscar</a>!).</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.whitman.edu">My alma mater, Whitman College,</a> gets favorable press on The Jimmy Kimmel Show Thursday night when Ben Stein talked about just having given a speech at the “prestigious liberal arts college in Walla Walla – a real place.”  Though the only things he mentioned about the “4th Happiest Campus”: a sign of “Coming Events” (so to speak) advertising a seminar in “Female Masturbation Technique” and the campus’s celebration of “Women’s Awareness Month” marked by chalk drawings of vaginas all over the sidewalks and walls, which the students loved, but janitorial staff complained about.  Actually this is all quite indicative, especially the prestigious liberal arts college part.</p>
