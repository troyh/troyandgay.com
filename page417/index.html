          <p>I mentioned this before but I finally signed up for <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com">O’Reilly’s Safari</a> because I wanted to read some chapters from a book to fix a sysadmin problem and couldn’t wait a week or more for a real book to arrive. Safari had the book, so I signed up (ironically, the sign up process doesn’t work with the <a href="http://apple.com/safari">Safari</a> web browser).</p>

<p>The particular book didn’t help me solve my problem, but now I know that and for only $9.99, I saved $35-50 on the book! And now I can read 4 other books this month for free. But the coolest thing about Safari is that you can post public or private comments on any page of the book! If this gets popular, it’ll basically be like reading someone else’s highlighting and corrections and clarifications. You can’t do that without the internet!</p>

<p>On the downside, the service is kinda slow, sometimes taking a minute or more to get to the next page.</p>

<p>And I did solve my original problem, but had more luck with Google searching mailing list archives.</p>

Too much wine. Nancy brought a delicious dessert over, unfortunately the recipe came from Bon Appetit.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Kevin &amp; Rachel and Reid &amp; Marissa threw a lovely engagement party for Mark &amp; Emily – only EIGHT years in the making ;-).  Mark’s sister Lisa is about to strike out in her own law practice (let me know if you need a great family law attorney in Seattle).  I just love hearing about people starting their own businesses.  Also learned Stork (Chris) is working on becoming a psychologist; this is after leaving a career as a medical doctor, and a degree in philosophy earned between, I think.  Interesting because he must have the most understanding and supportive wife in the universe (Gwenneth), but also because he was a bit of a hero to me – working in Viet Nam on protheses for land mine victims and then in the burn ward.  Turns out the latter was just too much…he couldn’t handle being around so much death.  One of the most interesting “I’m changing my life” conversations I’ve had…</p>

          <p>Fun dinner with Nancy &amp; Gary and Heather &amp; Larry which evolved into a crushing game of Trivial Pursuit.</p>
