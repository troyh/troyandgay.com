            <p>The Roku (pronounced “Row-koo”, not “Rock You”, I’ve discovered) player <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/06/03/roku-netflix-player/">we got 13 months ago</a>, one month past the 1-year warranty, died last Friday. They wouldn’t replace it so I ordered a replacement. Good thing they’re only $100. I tested the power supply and it was delivering the correct voltage so I assumed it was the box itself. I was wrong.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.roku.com/Images/netflixplayer/home_content_box.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I got the new one today and tried the new power supply and it does work. Hmmm. Maybe the amperage is wrong? I can’t test that. Well, with a replacement power supply, we will have two and can use the old one elsewhere. It’s a great device, otherwise.</p>

            <p>Today was the team time trial and, as expected, Astana won by 40 seconds, exactly the time difference between Armstrong and Cancellara. So they have the same time starting Stage 5 but Cancellara is still in yellow by a few hundredths of a second. Four of the top 5 positions in the race are Astana riders. I’ve never seen a team so dominant. It’d be amazing to see all three podium finishers from the same team, I don’t think that’s ever been done before.</p>

<p>Ben Stiller is now <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/36958130.html">hanging around Lance</a> and was allowed to be a podium girl and put the yellow jersey on Cancellara after the stage.</p>

            <p>The Tour is already exciting. It’s usually boring the first week but today Lance Armstrong got into a breakaway just 30km before the finish and gained 40 seconds on the other big contenders for the victory, including his teammate and favored winner, Alberto Contador. He’s ahead of him by 19 seconds.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is the team time trial which their team, Astana, is expected to win. If they do and beat team Saxo-Bank by 40+ seconds Lance will be in yellow tomorrow. And the tensions between him and Contador should be interesting.</p>

            <p>After watching the start to the Tour de France, we went over to Ron &amp; Debbie’s for their annual July 4th party. You can see the Vashon fireworks from their house. Gay made a very good cake too:</p>

<p>It doesn’t get dark here until after 9:30pm so the fireworks don’t start until 10pm so we left early to get the kids into bed.</p>

<p>Gay’s cake with the wrong number of stars and stripes on it reminds me of a story from high school…</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>In 11th grade I took an art class. A girl who sat next to me was drawing an American flag and asked me how many stars are on the flag. I told her that there were 50, one for each state. But another girl overheard me and said I was wrong, that there were only 48 states in the US – this was in 1986, well after Alaska and Hawaii were admitted. I insisted that there were 50 and she insisted that there were 48. Enough of that, so I suggested we ask our teacher and let her settle the argument. We called the teacher over and she told us we were both wrong, that there were 52 states in the US. The girl next to me put 52 stars on her flag.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We started meeting and interviewing architects in late March. It was a tough decision to pick one architect as several are very good. We interviewed seven Seattle architects and we chose <a href="http://www.millerhull.com/htm/home.htm">Miller-Hull</a>.</p>

<p>We expect it to take a year to design it and another year or more after that to build it. So we’re just at the start of a very long process that will consume a large part of our time for a while but are excited to get into it. We wrote our “program”, which is a description of each room of the house and how the rooms should relate to each other, and, in our case, a 56-page document. We had our first meeting last week to go over it with the architect.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>We picked Miller-Hull because we love their buildings, of course. They are, in our view, the inventors of the Pacific Northwest wood/concrete/steel style that we love. We also want an environmentally sustainable house and this is one of Miller-Hull’s skills (they wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0295984945?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0295984945">a book</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0295984945" alt="" /> on it, in fact).</p>

<p>They have a very collaborative approach both within the firm and with the client. We knew we’d want to be very involved in the process because we appreciate design and we want to be active in the design and building of our dream house – the house our kids will grow up in and, hopefully, want to come back to when they’re older (and we’re very old). We wanted an architect that would put up with, maybe even appreciate, our meddling in the process.</p>

<p>As for our current house, we’ve always hated it. Not only is it ugly and not fit the surroundings at all, it’s incredibly inefficient space-wise. It has so many 45° angles that it has, by our measure, 20% wasted space. That’s space that needs to be heated and cooled yet can’t be used as living area. There’s only two small bedrooms for kids (one without a closet) and no way to add another without making significant changes to the structure. The kitchen is completely separated from the rest of the house so the kids can’t be seen from the kitchen and when we have guests over, everyone squeezes into the kitchen. The great view we have is only visible from two rooms in the house and most windows are oriented away from the view – it’s as if the house was designed for another property and then plopped here. It’s very difficult to walk through the house with all the crazy angled walls – it feels chaotic to be in it and new visitors tend to get lost. And there’s entirely too many stairs for no good reason – what idiot put a sunken living room in which puts the seating <em>below</em> the view?! We have a ridiculously large master bedroom, a room we only use when we’re sleeping, and a bathroom that is also too large with a big bathtub that we never use and creates an inconvenient walking path into the bathroom. The windows throughout the house are so poorly placed that the temperature can vary 20 degrees from one room to the next – the dining room is unbearable in the summer and, at the same time, the office is so cold I have to turn on the electric heaters. Argh, I could go on and on….</p>

<p>At first we thought we could remodel the house to fix the biggest problems but the more we thought about it, the more we realized that it’d take almost as much money to fix the major things yet, after spending lots of money, we’d still be stuck with a house we mostly don’t like.</p>

<p>We think we can build a much more attractive house, with a more simple and open design that fits our lifestyle, and a more efficient house – using passive heating and cooling – to keep our electric bill as low as possible. We have a south-facing property with good clearance to the sun so we should be able to get lots of effective solar glazing to heat the house passively. The current house doesn’t take advantage of this at all with poorly-placed windows and no internal thermal mass to store heat or transfer it to the rest of the house. Cooling the house should be trivial, just have some open windows to catch the breeze and passively cool the house during the warmer summer months.</p>
