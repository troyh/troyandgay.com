          <p>Another day of walking all around. Havana loves to walk but we’re getting tired of walking and pushing a stroller around all day.</p>

<p>Sometimes before a nap the kids will wind down giving us signs that it’s time for their rest, but other times, like today, they show no signs of tiring until you look down and see their head leaning to the side and their eyes closed. Both Havana and Hudson took their afternoon naps in the stroller being wheeled around noisy and bumpy streets of London. They don’t complain and seem to be just as happy to keep going after they wake up, but I think it’s time to plan some destinations and make use of taxis and/or the Tube so they can get proper naps in beds.</p>

<p>We went to dinner at <a href="http://www.therunningfootman.biz/Only/theOnly.asp">The Only Running Footman</a> and had the upstairs dining room almost completely to ourselves, which makes it easier to have dinner with kids. But people started showing up at the same time the kids started getting tired and cranky. I see earlier dinners in our future and very few nice restaurants.</p>

          <p>When we had <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/05/18/mark-lee/">dinner with Mark and Lee</a> earlier this week, they suggested dinner on Thursday and Lee arranged for his niece Aimee to babysit Havana and Hudson so we could go out for a nice dinner. Mark and Aimee arrived out our apartment at 6:30pm and we buzzed them in. Havana and Gay waited at the door while Havana asked “Where’s Uncle Mark?” and suddently Eric popped up the stairs!</p>

<p>The last we heard from Eric he was in India on <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/27/erics-around-the-world-trip/">his around the world trip</a>, we hadn’t heard from him in many weeks and hadn’t seen him in over 10 months, so it was quite a surprise. Mark took some video of Gay’s face which I’m looking forward to seeing. When he heard through Mark that we were going to be in London, he decided to take a detour on his trip and come visit London and spend a few weeks in Europe.</p>

<p>After giving Aimee the rundown on the kids while we waited for Lee to arrive, we took a walk across Hyde Park into Kensington. The weather is perfect these days and it was a nice almost-sunset walk through the Park. They took us to <a href="http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/pubsandbars/the-prince-regent-review-18040.html">The Prince Regent</a> gastropub for dinner.</p>

<p>After dinner, we walked around Kensington for a while and then took a cab back to Mayfair for a beer at one of our neighborhood pubs.</p>

          <p>Last time we were in London in 2005 we walked by the <a href="http://www.ba-londoneye.com/">London Eye</a> and the line was crazy long so we decided not to wait. This time we planned ahead and bought tickets online where you can get “fast-track” tickets so you don’t have to wait in line (not to mention a 20% discount!).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3549183999/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2482/3549183999_23e4f3cc2d.jpg" alt="Four People at 450 feet" /></a></p>

<p>The downside is that you have to schedule your “flight” – it’s a British Airways sponsored attraction, so they call trips on it “flights” and the announcements refer to takeoffs and landings. Cute. Scheduling anything when you have kids is difficult, especially when you are planning to walk a route you haven’t yet walked. We gave ourselves plenty of time and scheduled it for 5:30pm thinking that’d be plenty of time after the kids’ afternoon naps, getting them ready, packing up the stroller and walking the 2.5 miles planning on Havana insisting on walking at least part of the way.</p>

<p>We convinced Havana to ride in the stroller so we made good time through Green Park, around Buckingham Palace, through St. James Park to the Thames. There seemed to be a Sri Lankan-related rally around Parliament, I assume about the Tamil leader who was killed.</p>

<p>We made it this far by 4:45pm and there’s a Fuller’s Pub conveniently located right there, <a href="http://www.pubs.com/pub_details.cfm?ID=233">The Red Lion</a>, so we stopped in for a pint. It amazes me how full pubs are after work in London. All the pubs have people spilling out into the street and there’s rarely a seat inside. Yet it’s still quick to get in and to get a beer. Brits really know how to live.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3549998006/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3395/3549998006_14c632d536.jpg" alt="The Red Lion Pub" /></a></p>

<p>We walked over the Westminster Bridge and up to the London Eye. The Fast-track tickets worked, we printed our tickets at the machine and were escorted right up to the front of the line and were in our capsule in minutes.</p>

<p>Havana loved it. She immediately positioned herself right by the glass and started pointing out everything she saw below. The capsule behind us had a little girl in it too and they waved at each other. She ran around the capsule checking out the different views. It was a less impressive to me… aside from Parliament and the river, there’s not much to see around London. London is sprawling, but not all that scenic from the air; it’s much more scenic from the ground, IMO.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3550004042/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3396/3550004042_64fa245ae3.jpg" alt="IMG_4413" /></a></p>

<p>After the London Eye, Havana insisted on walking. We walked back over the Hungerford Bridge, into Charring Cross, through Trafalgar Square, down the Mall into St. James Park, back into the Mayfair area looking for a place to have dinner. By this time it was 8pm and we needed to get the kids to bed, so we just came back to our neighborhood and got Indian food to go.</p>

<p>Total walking: 5.7 miles (thanks <a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/">Google Pedometer</a>!).</p>

          <p>After getting a late start due to napping, we walked to Hyde Park and went to a playground there for Havana to play. Then we walked (too far) to have a beer and a snack for the kids at The Iron Duke. We walked home through a shopping district, down Piccadilly and back to our apartment.</p>

<p>While Gay put the kids to bed, I ordered take-out dinner from an Italian place down the street. We watched TV from home over Slingplayer and went to bed.</p>

          <p>Mark and Lee came to our hotel, we had some wine and cheese and caught up since we saw them last May (<a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/18/vancouver-3/">in Vancouver</a> and <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/29/mark-lee-eric-and-dinner/">at our house</a> for Lee’s birthday).
