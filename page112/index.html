          </h3>
            <p>We went to <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2005/06/08/3091/">San Diego in 2005</a> so Gay and Megan could run the Rock ‘n Roll Marathon there. It came to Seattle for the first time this year and Gay and Megan ran it today. Actually, Megan ran the full marathon and, because Gay didn’t train much since our trip, Gay did the half-marathon.</p>

<p>It sold out so quickly that Gay didn’t even get an official ticket to run it. But Gay, Havana, Hudson and I got up early, took a 7am ferry into Seattle and walked to about the midpoint of the full marathon course, waited for Megan to reach that point and Gay jumped in and ran the rest of the race with her. Megan finished in 4:40, her best time of her 4 marathons.</p>

<p>While they were running, Havana, Hudson and I made our way to the finish line at Qwest Field. Hudson had fallen asleep in the stroller while waiting for Megan so he was easy, but Havana cried most of the walk asking “Where’d mommy go?” and “I wanna see mommy”. That ended when she spied the little Waterfall Park and asked to go in and see it. She didn’t want to leave. When we did leave, she didn’t want to ride in the stroller or walk, so I had to carry her while pushing the stroller. She’s getting too heavy to carry.</p>

<p>We got to Qwest field, made our way through the crowds to find the finish line. It was way too crowded to get anywhere near it, especially with a stroller and 2 kids, to get a photo of them crossing. We walked around for a bit by Qwest Field and I spotted a big “BJ’s Brewhouse” sign on a fence, which I recognized as a great chain of brewpubs, <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/16/monterey-to-san-francisco/#more-3289">one of which we went to in California</a>. Ah hah, I know how to kill some time! We got over there and in little print under the sign was “VIP Access Only”. Damn. I’m definitely not a VIP. I still had an hour to wait and I knew <a href="http://www.elysianbrewing.com/Fields.html">Elysian Fields</a> was around there somewhere, so I walked in the general direction and found it, right next to the marathon finish line. How convenient. We went in there and to the “lounge” where a couple other race participants and their kids were hanging out. Perfect. I could feed Hudson lunch, get Havana a cold milk and me a cold beer. Supporting your wife running a marathon doesn’t have to be all work.</p>

<p>About at noon, Gay, who was carrying her iPhone, texted me that they were approaching mile marker 25. A few minutes later, Megan’s family (mom, brother, sister, niece and nephew) showed up at Elysian Fields and we got a big table. Gay texted me again telling me they were finished and to have beers ready for them. Gay and Megan arrived a few minutes later and we all had lunch. Tiffany and Brad, who were also following them on the course by (tandem!) bike, stopped by for a beer. Then Dorothy, who had ran the half-marathon and already went home and showered, came by for a beer too.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Hudson is 10 months old today. He finally started to crawl a few days ago and crawls all over the place now. He even took a few steps while holding onto furniture (“cruising”) before that. He can put food in his mouth as he did at 9 months, but still prefers that it be done for him. He has six teeth now.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We had a meeting in downtown Seattle this afternoon and after that we went to Tom Douglas’ neighborhood for a cocktail at <a href="http://www.tomdouglas.com/restaurants/dahlia-lounge">Dahlia Lounge</a> and then next door to <a href="http://www.tomdouglas.com/restaurants/serious-pie">Serious Pie</a> for dinner. Gay has been there a couple times but it was my first time. We shared the cherry bomb peppers, sweet fennel sausage pizza and the guanciale, soft egg, arugula pizza. Both were fantastic and an egg, which I’ve never had before, was surprisingly good on a pizza.</p>

<p>See Tom Douglas, the owner and famous Seattle restaurateur, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ngxpwrnt7bM">talk about the place</a>.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Today is the official kick-off to Father’s Day Week.This is my 3rd Father’s Day and first with Hudson. Happy Father’s Day to me. :)</p>

<p>Gay and Havana made blueberry pancakes for breakfast before I opened a couple gifts. I got a soldering iron, which I can use to fix Havana’s electric toys that seem to break often and have been thinking about getting for a while, and a Kindle 2, which surprised me. Gay read a book on my kindle while on vacation and felt sorry for me having to use the much inferior version 1 device. I thought I could suffer through another year or so until Kindle 3 came out, but Gay thought that was too long to wait.</p>

<p>We almost went to the <a href="http://www.washingtonbeer.com/wabf.htm">Washington Brewer’s Festival</a>, but the weather in the morning seemed so nice I didn’t want to miss out on using the hammock. And believe it or not, I didn’t much feel like spending the afternoon tasting beers and pushing kids around in the hot sun. I got some time in the hammock reading a book (on the Kindle, which is much less painful to hold than the Kindle 1) but the rain came in and forced me inside. Good thing we didn’t go to the beer festival because the rain was pretty heavy.</p>

<p>Later, I split a couple beers (Ninkasi’s Tricerahops Double IPA and Bear Republic’s Racer 5 IPA) with Gay before dinner.</p>

<p>Before I forget this story, I should write it down and Father’s Day is an appropriate day for it. While on <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/05/17/seattle-to-london/">the flight to London</a> several weeks ago, a man sat across the aisle from me. Hudson was sitting on my lap before the plane took off and I had some small talk with the guy about the kids, his kids and such. He has two kids, both are in their 20s now and he told me how it’s great to see them grow up into adults. He started reading a book and later on the flight, Hudson was again on my lap. The man leaned over to me and reminded me about what he said about kids growing up. He showed me the bookmark he was using to read his book. It was really old and worn and had a kid’s drawing on it. He said his son made it for him when he was four years old and he’s been using it as a bookmark ever since and just realized it had been 19 years! His son probably spent 10 minutes making it and doesn’t even remember doing it today, but he used it for every book he read ever since. He leaned over to Hudson and said “See the affect you have on us?”. It’s amazing how kids change everything you think and do and they’ll never realize it because we were always parents to them.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We got our new iPhones today. But once again, AT&amp;T is <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10269270-37.html">unable to handle the number of activations</a> so mine has no service and may not for 48 hours:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3641564483/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3393/3641564483_de02832558.jpg" alt="Waiting for activation" /></a></p>

<p>We skipped the iPhone 3G last year so this feels like a big improvement over the original iPhone. I wasn’t even that excited about this one, though, since I am still very happy with my iPhone (because it’s the greatest device ever made!). But the improved camera and video made it compelling to me because too often I don’t have a camera handy, but I always have my iPhone, when I want to snap a photo of the kids. The video isn’t HD, but low-quality video is better than no video.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the <a href="http://www.electronista.com/articles/09/06/19/iphone.3g.s.teardown/">hardware in the iPhone 3G S can support HD</a> (720p) video so they may add it later via a software update.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> It seems that <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/06/19/apple_warns_iphone_3g_s_activations_may_take_up_to_2_days.html">the problem is with Apple</a>, not AT&amp;T since it’s happening worldwide, not just on AT&amp;T’s network in the US. I called AT&amp;T’s customer service and was told that “the order for my activation hasn’t even reached them yet”, implying that it’s stuck somewhere else, presumably at Apple. Apple makes great hardware and software, but boy do <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/07/23/apples-mobileme-outage/">they suck at providing services</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Jun 20 10am Update:</strong> It’s been 24 hours now and I still have no cellular service. I called AT&amp;T for the 3rd time and they refunded my $18 activation fee, at least. They confirmed to me that Apple is the problem – Apple’s servers that handle activations through iTunes are not working or are “overloaded”. It seems unlikely that they’re overloaded, all they’re doing is sending my phone’s info to AT&amp;T. My guess is that Apple’s IT staff handling iPhone activations is as inept as the IT staff that handles MobileMe and they just can’t figure out what the problem is. AT&amp;T is no longer saying “48 hours” either, two customer service reps told me that they don’t have any idea when it’ll be fixed and apologized for the problem.</p>

<p><strong>Jun 20 12pm Update:</strong> <em>After 26 hours, I got activated!</em> After reading on the internets that you should really make sure that AT&amp;T has the correct SIM number for your SIM card, I called AT&amp;T a 4th time. Sure enough, someone mistyped the SIM card when I called yesterday. The AT&amp;T rep, Ashley Bartlett, fixed it and in seconds, my phone was activated! Had I not done this myself I don’t think my phone ever would have been activated.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, I got this text message from AT&amp;T:</p>

<p>bq. AT&amp;T Free Msg: Your data plan is not eligible for iPhone 3G. To prevent excess charges and enable Visual VM, please call 611 to add a Data Plan for iPhone.</p>

<p>Hmm… I called them for the 5th time, explained the situation and got my account corrected. All of this mess was caused by Apple, they never sent my upgrade info to AT&amp;T so AT&amp;T never knew to activate my new phone and change my data plan. I like that Apple is trying to automate the process and not require that iPhone users have to contact the cellular provider’s customer service to get activated, but after 2 years they should have worked out the kinks. They’ve had 3 iPhone launches and all have been rife with activation problems – I was affected by two of the three, I had a bricked iPhone for 24 hours after the iPhone 2.0 software update last year. I hope the fourth next year goes better.</p>

<p><strong>Jun 20 8:26pm Update:</strong> I got this email from Apple telling me I’m activated:</p>

<blockquote>Dear Apple Customer,
We appreciate your recent iPhone purchase at the Apple Store.
Congratulations! Your iPhone activation has been completed.
For your reference, the Activation ID of the completed order is: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
Thank you for shopping at the Apple Store!
Sincerely,
The Apple Store Team</blockquote>

<p>Not even an apology for their screw-up.</p>

<p><strong>Jun 21 Update:</strong> Apple <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-10269855-233.html">notified people</a> who have to wait more than 48 hours for their phone to activate and gave them $30 credits at the iTunes store. For those of us who only had to wait 26 hours, nothing, not even an apology.</p>
