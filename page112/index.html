          <p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3335/3531238317_5eaf659279_m.jpg" alt="Gay on bridge" />I’m training to run the <a href="http://www.rnrseattle.com/">Seattle RocknRoll Marathon</a> June 27th with my friends Laura &amp; Megan.  It has been <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2006/04/17/recent-history-inn-at-langley-whidbey-marathon/">years since I ran</a> a <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2005/06/08/3091/">marathon</a>, so it is like starting over.  My first long run over 10 miles actually happened on our San Fransisco trip, when I ran along the waterfront and across the Golden Gate bridge and back.  I was surprised to learn the bridge is two miles long.  I love the bridge.  It is gorgeous architecturally, and the orange color makes it stand out against the city on the south side and the green rolling hills on the north. It is dorky to say, but crossing the bridge on foot was exhilarating.  One of the best running experiences of my life.  Tomorrow I am aiming for 19 miles.</p>

          <p>We picked up our repaired Mac Pro at the Apple Store (I love AppleCare!) and then went out to dinner tonight in Seattle. The food was disappointing and we had to listen the waiter tell us that he doesn’t believe in global warming and that he’s sick of the Spanish-speaking people in California.</p>

<p>After dinner and on the way home, we stopped at my favorite pub, Beveridge Place, for a beer so that I could attend one event during <a href="http://www.seattlebeerweek.com/">Seattle Beer Week</a>. There was a beer geek trivia contest going on that we played, but we did terrible. I thought I was a beer geek, but those questions were hard!</p>

Dang, this is surprising, but it will speed up our summer BBQ prep.  Other things I learned:  half of the world’s asparagus is white – why is it so hard to find here then? – and each stalk keep growing after harvest.</p>
