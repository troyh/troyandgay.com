<p>_Even in the most pessimistic version of their model, they found that it would take about 5,000 downloads to displace sales of just one physical CD, the authors wrote. Despite the huge scale of downloading worldwide, that would be only a tiny contribution to the overall slide in album sales over the past several years, they said.</p>

<p>Moreover, their data seemed to show that downloads could even have a slight positive effect on the sales of the top albums, the researchers said._</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,115424,pg,1,RSS,RSS,00.asp">Bush calls for high-speed internet for all Americans</a> by 2007. He doesn’t say what he is going to do and I don’t know what the government can or should do about this, but I’m glad to see that he finally showed an interest in the internet. Apparently, Kerry is going to announce his broadband internet plans soon. Why is this a campaign issue?</p>

According to Pat Robertson, though,  God wants Bush to win in 2004. Is God trying to create a war?!</p>

<p>When someone says that God told them something you agree with, that person is a spiritual leader. But if it’s something you don’t agree with, that person is a lunatic. Weird how that works. Kinda like everything: people only believe what they want to believe.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We got home from our mini-vacation in Vancouver yesterday. Ate lots of good food while we were there, including <a href="http://www.evevancouver.ca/food/kitsilano.htm#Maria's">the best Greek food</a> I’ve had in 8 years. Seattle is terrible for Greek food and it’s one thing I really miss from Washington, DC.</p>

<p>One thing that surprised me about Vancouver is the beer selection. Most restaurants have local beers, but none were that good. I ended up just having Stella Artois (Belgian beer in British Columbia; why not British beer?!) most of the time. Although we went to a couple brewpubs for good beer, <a href="http://www.steamworks.com/">Steamworks</a> had the best beer and good pizza (but terrible terrible service at lunch time).</p>
