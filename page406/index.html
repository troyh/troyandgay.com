          <p>A few hiccups in the new caching mechanism, but they seem to be mostly ironed out now. But I was woken up by a squawking pager at 5am, at 6am and at 7am. Fortunately, it was nothing too serious and I had my laptop on the nightstand and could deal with stuff quickly without leaving bed. By 7am, I was up and by 10am had fixed a few bugs. And it’s running really well so far.</p>

<p>Oh, and it is <em>FAST!!!</em></p>

          <p>Except for the 2 trips to the vet and late lunch break of pot stickers, Gay &amp; I have been slaving away in front of our computers working on a <em>major</em> change to Recipezaar’s caching mechanism. We feel pretty good about it at this point and are working on pushing it up to the site. Hopefully this will go well tonight, but will require lots of monitoring and nail-biting.</p>

          <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/illy2.jpg" alt="illy2.jpg" />$250 later, Illy’s back home and is a new dog. She’ll be on <em>intestinal distress</em> food for a couple days, but otherwise, she’s perfectly healthy.</p>

          <p>Just heard from the vet. Illy’s doing “great” and we can pick her up at 4. “Great” is a lot more reassurring than “Probably not” when asked if she will die. That made Gay cry; this made her smile.</p>

          <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/ouzo.jpg" alt="ouzo.jpg" />I may as well put a picture up of our other dog, Ouzo. Both dogs are named after beverages for some reason. Ouzo’s a “licker”. Get it? Yeah, it really is that funny. Ouzo’s fine today, had a little ball-playing in the yard as he loves (and I mean loves) to fetch. He fetches to the point of obsessiveness. He just doesn’t stop. Ever.</p>
