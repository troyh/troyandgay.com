            <p>Another jump in Alexa. Up to <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details?url=recipezaar.com">9,150</a>. I hate to say it, but I enjoy that our biggest competitor, AllRecipes, is consistently falling in the same ranking. $20 million in debt and still losing $4 million/yr, AllRecipes should be humbled, but they are less than the nicest people in this biz and they’ve even tried to flex their muscle against us with copyright violation claims on recipes they stole from other people. I also think it’s funny that we’ve had more than one employee of theirs call us asking for a job. :-)</p>

            <p>After the longest outage in Recipezaar history (almost 4 hours), Gay &amp; I just got back from downtown Seattle after installing another new machine with a 120GB hard drive. This should be enough for the new caching system (for now). In case anyone doesn’t know, standing in a loud server room with the air conditioning blasting so much you get a headache from the cold, cramped between rack cases and no chair in sight is not a fun place to spend a few hours.</p>

<p>Since we had some time before the next ferry home, we stopped at a brewpub we discovered weeks ago in West Seattle. They have a really good Pale Ale that I really like and very good food for pub food. Beer is good. 5 minutes before the ferry left, we realized the time and bolted out the door and made the last few miles to the ferry dock in 4 minutes and was the last car on the ferry.</p>

            <p>Our new caching mechanism is great, but it requires a huge amount of disk space. We ran out of space in 12 hours after first installing it. And this was on a Sunday, which is a very slow day for the site. We made a quick-and-dirty change to pull disk space from another server. We’ll see how long that lasts. In the meantime, we’re working on getting more hard disk space. Good thing hard drives are cheap.</p>

            <p>To add to Gay’s analogy of running a 24/7 store, also imagine that you think your store is plenty big enough, your staff is sufficiently trained, the door is functioning at optimum performance in all your testing. You’ve planned and tested and  you’ve been building stores for your entire professional life. Then you put the “Open” sign up and within minutes your store is completely filled with people, all wanting different things at the same time, your staff is overworked and asking for higher pay and more benefits. Unfortunately, you’re not taking in any revenue from all these customers (you’re a store-builder, not a business(wo)man).</p>

<p>It can be extremely frustrating at times. Part of you wants to just shut it all down and give up. But the other part of you sees it as a challenge and you refuse to be beaten and you just know that if you work that much harder, you sacrifice yet another day/weekend/social event, you will win.</p>

            <p>My godmother Jean Craigen died last week.  I have not been close to my godparents since I’ve been in high school, but my mother has been.  I have a tremendous amount of respect for them both, and feel very sorry for Pat – I just don’t know what he’ll do without her.  Jean was perhaps the nicest lady in the world and had a distinctive voice and cadence that I always adored.  I would have missed work and traveled to the funeral Tuesday, but mom said if I could make my own peace with Jean’s death, then coming to provide support might be futile – I’d be lost in the sea of her admirers.  I hope to make a more meaningful visit to Pat later this year, and I’m glad she was well-remembered and loved.
Several other people have died…

My great aunt Babe passed away recently.  I was very angry with my father’s side of the family for not bothering to notify me about it until weeks later.  She was one of the more colorful relatives on that side of the family and lived here in Seattle.  I most certainly would have attended the wake had I known.
My neighbor down the street died after a long battle with cancer.  We’d met “cancer man” shortly after we moved here after an unfortunate incident with our dog Ouzo.  We got into a bit of a fight with him that we deeply regretted, and he did too.  We saw him again a couple of days later and both sides apologized profusely.  I can’t imagine I would have cared as much had the same occurrance happened in Seattle, esp. in our old neighborhood.  I felt like that incident signaled that the change of moving from Seattle to Vashon was much bigger than a zip code.  I’ve spent lots of time chatting with Mark and Mary at the bus stop with their kids since.</p>

<p>Friday I got the opportunity to make a salad for a potluck dinner provided by our neighbors for the many visitors and extended family in town for Mark’s funeral service.  I was glad to get the opportunity to do something – we didn’t attend the service.  Funny isn’t it that I actually gave something to basically strangers, but for the family deaths I only sent cards.</p>
