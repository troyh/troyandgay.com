          <p>Just heard from the vet. Illy’s doing “great” and we can pick her up at 4. “Great” is a lot more reassurring than “Probably not” when asked if she will die. That made Gay cry; this made her smile.</p>

          <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/ouzo.jpg" alt="ouzo.jpg" />I may as well put a picture up of our other dog, Ouzo. Both dogs are named after beverages for some reason. Ouzo’s a “licker”. Get it? Yeah, it really is that funny. Ouzo’s fine today, had a little ball-playing in the yard as he loves (and I mean loves) to fetch. He fetches to the point of obsessiveness. He just doesn’t stop. Ever.</p>

          <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/illy.jpg" alt="illy.jpg" />Illy was shaky this morning and couldn’t even walk around much. We thought she may have had a stroke. We made a vet appointment and a few minutes later she threw up a huge amount of green gunk. She felt much better after that but we took her to the vet anyway. The vet thinks she just ate some toxic or just rancid food (we have a “pig farm” nearby where she goes to steal food) and gave her something that made her throw up even more to get it out. We left her there all day while they run some tests on her. Poor Illy.</p>
