          </h3>
            <p>I’ve always thought that software companies were living on borrowed times by being protected from lawsuits due to defects in their products. Now, a South Korean group <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,1054790,00.asp">is suing</a> Microsoft for the SQL Slammer virus. This was a bad one across Asia and even impacted Recipezaar due to other servers on the subnetwork we’re on using MS SQL Server. I think the biggest effect on software in the next decade will be retraction of the EULA agreements we all agree to when we open the package. If Ford can be sued for damages in their defective products, why can’t a software company?</p>

Appropriately the dirty bomb is scheduled to go off at the the Tully’s coffee roasting plant (mwhahaha).  I sort of wish I could volunteer to be a victim/actor – it is as close as I hope to be to a real attack, but it would be interesting to see how it all goes down.</p>

            <p>Watched a very moving <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/burden/">Frontline</a> on <a href="http://www.pbs.org">PBS</a> (which is by far the most interactive media company) which dealt with the burdens faced by those that have been released from prison as a result of DNA testing.   I can’t even fathom 10 or 20 or more years in prison when you are innocent of the crime.  Only 17 states have some type of retribution laws (not Washington) and the federal max is $5,000.  I’m giving to <a href="http://www.innocenceproject.org/">The Innocence Project</a> this year.</p>

            <p>I just (re)discovered <a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/online/index.html">The Visual Thesaurus</a>.  Granted, they don’t have a large data set yet, but I think the spider diagram is actually a very effective representation…much better than the traditional Roget’s double look-up.  Wonder how we could represent related recipes or similar chefs this way – am I too obsessed that this was my first thought?

            <p>We completely redid the recipe pages on the site, which will result in a much faster system and much better caching system, similar to the way the browse pages are done. But it looks like there’s a few minor bugs on the recipe page. Not bad for the amount of work we did last week on this, though.</p>
