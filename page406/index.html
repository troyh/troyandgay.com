          <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/raccoon.jpg" alt="raccoon.jpg" /> The dogs went nuts at 4am. They refused to shutup so I turned on the light on the back deck and saw nothing. Then a huge <a href="http://www.loomcom.com/raccoons/">raccoon</a> ran by the door! I guess the dogs don’t like raccoons. Anyway, I layed awake thinking about how to improve the caching mechanism on Recipezaar, and at 6:30 just decided to get out of bed. Of course, the dogs thought it was breakfast time. I explained it wasn’t and they went back to bed and probably fell asleep within 30 seconds. Stupid dogs.</p>

<p>I reassembled a new server we’re building because the fan noise was driving me nuts all day yesterday. Need to go make some coffee…</p>

          <p>It seems like the nice days of Spring are over in Seattle. Yesterday it was pouring rain and today is not looking promising. I need to get out and ride my bike too!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Mid-afternoon it cleared up and the sun came out. Went for a 45-minute ride at 4:30. Uneventful, but it was nice to be out.</p>

          <p>Up to 9,500 on <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details?url=recipezaar.com">Alexa</a>. It’s weird how their charts go, though. Traffic steadily increases month to month but looking at their <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=recipezaar.com">chart</a>, March was way down and April is only as high as February, which is definitely not true based on our figures.</p>

          <p>We went to a friend’s house for Easter brunch. Lots of good food. And it was actually a hot morning in Seattle, must’ve been 75 degrees!</p>

          <p><a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/pacificnw/2003/0420/cover.html">Vashon Island</a>, described by activist Rita Schenck as “one-third artists, one-third environmentalists and one-third lawyers.”  I guess that makes us lawyers.  Cover story of this week’s Pacific Northwest Magazine talks about Vashon’s efforts to be self-sustaining.  There’s evena guy here who makes his own bio-diesel fuel by recycling oil from deep-fryers – “his exhaust smells like french fries” and his operations recently burnt down.</p>
