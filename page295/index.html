            <p>A former Defense Dept. employee <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2004/03/10/osp_moveon/">reveals the truth about the misleading claims</a> used to create the reason for war.</p>

<p><em>Will Americans hold U.S. policymakers accountable? Will we return to our roots as a republic, constrained and deliberate, respectful of others? My experience in the Pentagon leading up to the invasion and occupation of Iraq tells me, as Ben Franklin warned, we may have already failed. But if Americans at home are willing to fight – tenaciously and courageously – to preserve our republic, we might be able to keep it.</em></p>

            <p><a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2004/03/001929.php#001929">Troy and I disagree about “Capturing the Friedmans.”</a>  While the father, Arnold, was undoubtedly a pedophile, it is doubtful that he and the son Jesse should have been convicted on hundreds of counts of molestation when not a scrap of physical evidence was ever found.  The police, caught up in ‘80 mass child rape hysteria, told children they would end up gay if they didn’t agree to the detectives’ assertions of occurrences of sodomy.  Many of the children only “remembered” these (outrageous) incidents after Recovered Memory Hypnotherapy.
To me the movie was less about the tragedy of Jesse’s innocence – though I do agree with Troy the outline of the movie does not divulge Arnold’s guilt early enough – than the tragedy of seeing a family dissolve in real time with the family videos captured during the time of the trial.  There is a very haunting video journal scene that was never meant to make it to the big screen, and the honesty is scary.  The real tragedy is that (because of bad advice from lawyers and Arnold’s guilt) Arnold capsizes his whole family.  An effort to save Jesse, actually convicts him.  A mother vilified for not standing by her family, is simply honestly confused.  The children do not seem to understand that she has a different relationship with her husband (wife) which makes the situation more difficult for her.
I believe the film is ambiguous, and that is what is so interesting about it.  It was not just some bleeding-heart documentary filmmaker out to do justice (<a href="http://www.wm3.org">Free the West Memphis Three</a>), because wrongs were done on both sides.  This is the type of story you normally see in an independent film (fiction), the fact that it is true and you see original sources makes it all the more haunting.</p>

            <p>Last October, I <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/10/001753.php">posted</a> about my frustrations with FedEx. That post is very high, currently 7th, in Google’s results for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=fedex+sucks&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">“fedex sucks”</a> so I get a lot of comments on it from other frustrated FedEx customers. But even more interesting is that several FedEx employees have posted explaining their side of the story. Very interesting.</p>

<p>And again, I say: I love the web!</p>

            <p><a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/163536_msftsco07.html">Microsoft denies</a> they are funding <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2004/03/001923.php#001923">SCO’s lawsuits against linux</a>. Good news, but Microsoft has a tendency to lie in their denials, specifically the recent (but considerably less significant) <a href="http://www.toiletmuseum.com/iloo.html">iLoo</a> and their <a href="http://www.macmerc.com/article.php?sid=374">faked “Switch story”</a>. I’m sure the truth will be revealed eventually.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> There are now reports that the SEC is investigating Microsoft and SCO for “under-the-table” financial dealings.</p>
