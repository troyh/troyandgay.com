          </h3>
            <p>I kegged my beer last weekend and it’s carbonated, cold and drinkable now. It’s an IPA and the second time I brewed this one this year because it’s so good. It’s nicely hoppy in both aroma and a lasting aftertaste.
<img src="http://troyandgay.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/IMG_0852.JPG" alt="IMG_0852.JPG" /></p>

<p>Here’s the recipe:</p>

<p>6.6 Lbs  Coopers Light Malt
1 Lbs Coopers Light Dry Malt
8 oz Crystal 40L
8 oz Cara-Pils
1/2 oz Galena hops @boil
1 oz Columbus hops @ 40 minutes
2 oz Cascade hops @ 55 minutes
White Labs California Ale Yeast</p>

<p>For Christmas 2003 Gay got me a beer tap setup. It’s almost dangerous to have a beer tap in your house.

            <p><a href="http://troyandgay.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/IMG_0809.jpg"><img src="http://troyandgay.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/IMG_0809.jpg" alt="IMG_0809.jpg" /></a>An order of 10 servers arrived yesterday. This is the largest order of machines we’ve ordered yet. As Gay says, we bought the equivalent of a car from Dell. Now I know how Dell makes so much money while GM and Ford are on the verge of bankruptcy!
When you order one server, Dell ships it UPS. When you order 10, they ship them freight. These went through four carriers to get here: Conway Express to Watkins Motor Lines to Oak Harbor Freight to Vashon Trucking.</p>

<p>These are our first batch of Dell servers. I’ve never been a fan of Dell; I think their desktops are really cheap and their customer service is terrible. But the first server we ever bought back in 1999 when we started was a Dell, and it was suprisingly well-made.</p>

<p>After various problems with servers from our current vendor and the lack of good <a href="http://www.intel.com/design/servers/ipmi/">IPMI</a> support in the machines, I decided to look into other vendors. To make a long story short, Dell’s prices were comparable and have great IPMI support built-in. Even better, Dell assigned us a sales rep who gave us significant discounts on hardware. With that, we could buy 5 Dells for the price of 4 from our current vendor.</p>

<p>Their tech support is still lousy – I had to buy a machine to answer the questions myself that tech support couldn’t answer beforehand. But Dell has so many customers that the community of Dell owners, via mailing lists, forums, etc., who are knowledgeable provide better support than their own tech support. And overall, I’m impressed with the quality of the hardware and Dell’s documentation – I’ve actually had questions answered by reading their documentation! I don’t think that’s happened with hardware or software for me since 1988.
These 10 servers will bring the total number of servers we manage to 38. Yahoo or Google probably throw away 38 machines a day, but I’m amazed at the amount of hardware we manage. And by this time next year, we’ll probably have 60+ servers. I remember thinking years ago that at most Recipezaar would require 5 servers (but then again, I’m also the guy who originally said we could do everything with Microsoft software).</p>

            <p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/32/88715108_d1a8443323_m.jpg" alt="" />We sold the Grand Cherokee on eBay on Thursday to a Marine stationed in Okinawa, Japan. That’s something that would’ve been impossible just a few years ago! He lives in the Seattle area and hopes to come back in July. His parents came to complete the transaction yesterday, somewhat concerned that their son bought a car on the internet.</p>

<p>It is and was a great car. Gay and I started dating shortly after I helped her find the car in 1998 – she wanted a Nissan Pathfinder and I wisely talked her into a Grand Cherokee (I also owned one a the time). We took it to California that summer to tour Napa Valley, to San Francisco and camping in the Redwood Forest. I dented the side when I was teaching Gay how (not) to parallel park.Oh the memories.I hated to see it go. But we now have a Jeep Commander that Gay talked me into this time.</p>

<p>I still have my beautiful 1985 BMW 535i – not a 528, a 535! – relaxing in the garage. One day I may even drive it again.</p>

            <p>Moved the site from an ancient server to a newer, better, more powerful server, upgraded to WordPress 2.0, put a stock theme on it. Done. Now I can go brew my beer.</p>

            <p>I just bought a couple of things I’m absolutely in love with:
<a href="http://thepubshoppe.com/British%20Pint%20Glasses.html"><img src="http://thepubshoppe.com/Glassware/Pint-glasses--x-2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
half-pint glasses (for kid-size beer)</p>

My stylist has been recommending Mason Pearson hair brushes for years to me, but I could never imagine spending a bunch on a brush (!), but this brush really is amazing.  Smoother than any other brush ever, and it will last for many years with proper care.  It really is better than any brush or comb I’ve ever had, and makes my hair fall smooth and straight.  It is most amazing that the brush itself (and all of its packaging) has not changed since the brushes were first made in 1905.</p>
