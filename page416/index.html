            <p>Saw [](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/RoadtoPerdition-1114614/)Road to Perdition last night – first dvd we’ve watched in a month or something.  Paul Newman was easily the best part of the film; he delivers several amazing speeches/lines and commands your attention every moment he is on screen.  The story is good, but it is cloddingly revealed.  Jude Law tries to act creepy and uses one too many tricks to prove it, so he just is annoying.  The cinematography is excellent – god, does it ever stop raining there – but in the end I’m completely outside the core dilemma: Newman (family before good business) v. Hanks (good business before family).  Hank’s choice let him to perdition. Mendes’s [](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/AmericanBeauty-1093536/)American Beauty was a much better movie.  As Troy says “He made American Beauty, no wonder I didn’t like this.”</p>

            <p>The mastermind behind the hijacking of the <a href="http://www.terrorismvictims.org/terrorists/achille-lauro.html">Achille Lauro</a> in 1985 was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/04/15/sprj.irq.abbas.arrested/index.html">caught today</a> in Iraq, attempting to escape into Syria.  It’s becoming more and more clear that Iraq was a supporter of terrorism. I wonder how many more of these rocks they’ll turn over in Iraq.</p>

            <p>I haven’t paid taxes since the 1999 tax year since my income has always been negative, but this year, with a slightly positive income, I am getting $231 back because of the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=96456,00.html">Earned Income Credit</a>. And it’s going to be donated to <a href="http://recipezaar.com">my favorite charity</a>.</p>

            <p>Sounds like <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/04/14/sprj.irq.war.main/index.html">the war is over</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s summarize:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>27 days long (3 days less than the anticipated 30 days)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Less than 100 US casualties (in ‘91, the US had 147 casualties)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hundreds of Iraqi civilians dead</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unknown, but likely thousands, of Iraqi military dead</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We don’t know where Saddam is, but we know he’s not in power</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We haven’t found any chemical weapons yet</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>$75 billion spent so far</p>
  </li>
</ul>

            <p>My mom was here for a visit this weekend.  Friday potluck with Gary &amp; Nancy and John &amp; Deborah…so much fun, so much wine.   Hilariously, Nancy revealed her jealously of her granddaughter (perhaps a common syndrome, I dunno, I found it facinating) and we had a regular Prozac Nation group session.  Funny.  The effortless honesty of these folks makes me proud to call them my friends and perhaps is a sharp contrast to other relationships.</p>

<p>Sunday we had my mom’s cousins for dinner, Jimmy &amp; Donnie and Linda &amp; Mike.  They all tease each other so much Troy was confused as to who was married to who with all the bickering.  I could…

…listen to Jimmy tell stories and make faces all night, but it was a conversation with Mike that hangs with me.  They are best friends with their kids (who are my age).  No really, they all go on vacation together every year, and do everything together.  Not in a Mormony way, but because they all just love to have fun.  Mike told me how much he loves his grandchildren too and how he wants to take his grandkids fishing and teach them stuff.  He wants to be like his dad was to his kids: available.  When you are young and  making a living you can’t always be available.  He told me “don’t wait too long to have kids, because you don’t want to miss out on really being able to enjoy being a grandparent.”</p>
