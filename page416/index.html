            <p>We’ve got a pair of bald eagles in our neighborhood.  For the past year it has been fun to watch them riding the thermals in the bay.  Today we noticed one carrying branches to make a nest in a Douglas Fir in our front yard.  We had hoped they were picking branches from our enormous yard waste pile (we even contemplated putting up a sign for them: Free Nest Stuff), but it turns out eagles make nests by flying by living trees, grabbing branches off the top with their feet and breaking them off.  Snap, snap, snap.  It was sort of weird.  <a href="http://baldeagles.org/baldeagl.htm">Eagles live to be 40 and mate for life</a> –  I sure hope they preparing for babies.  Guess we won’t be building anything in our yard anytime soon, at least not without the permission of the Secretary of the Interior …eagles nests are protected as they are still classified as endangered (though technically they are not)</p>

I tells ya, Yale press puts out some quality paperback – nice stock, good font, sexy cover, lots of quality photos, etc.  The content was a little lacking in what I was seeking: actual solutions for keeping a natural yard.  That said, I learned a few nuggets…

Before EPA new emissions standards for lawnmowers manufactured after September 1997, “in the one hour it takes to mow a lawn, the power lawn mower emits pollutants equivalent to driving 350 miles.”</p>

<p>“Yard waste is the second largest component of the waste stream; three-quarters of yeard waste is grass clippings from our lawns.  Clippings generally get bagged in large polyurethane or paper bags and find their way to the curb on garbage day.” … Not only are our landfillings filling quickly, but this practice is bad for serveral other reasons:  Clippings should not be considered waste.  Removal of clippings may result in a loss of up to 100 pounds of nitrogen per acre of lawn per year.  An additional problem is that decomposing lawn wastes in landfills can produce methane, one of the most powerful greenhouse gases….  Pesticide-laden grass clipping also interfer with the process of biological decomposition that would otherwise help to break down our garbage, thereby adding to the rapidity with which we fill up our solid waste dumps.</p>

<p>“Clover has a microorganism that lives in close association with its roots.  This microorganism takes nitrogen from the air and converts it to a form that the clover can use.  When the clover dies or loses plant parts, nitrogen is added to the soil, where both grass and clover can use it again.  This unique arrangement reduced the need for nitrogen fertilizers.  Clover also has attractive white flowers, its roots bind the soil, and it can live in harmony with the grass.
“You might ask why this wonder plan tis not a more widely accepted component of today’s lawn.  Several decades ago, clovers <em>was</em> a part of most American lawns.  Although some people have never appreciated its bee-attracting flowers, clover officially went out of style when a large seed and chemical company launced a campaign agains clover in the lawn. …</p>

<p>“Longer grass blades act to shade teh soil and to reduce evaporation and root stress.  Longer greass usually means deeper, more efficient roots that can better withstand drought and disease.  … Because rotary mowers tend to rip the blades, which increases water loss, it is a good idea to keep you rotary blade sharp.  Frequent sharpening and balancing of your mower blad can reduce fuel consumption by as much as 22 percent. …</p>

<p>“Most homeowners apply twice as much water as lawns need.  …Frequent light watering will produce shallow roots, making the plant highly susceptible to drought. Less frequent but deep watering produces deep roots that are able to withstand modest drought.”</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Our local newspaper, <a href="http://www.vashonbeachcomber.com/">The Beachcomber</a>, ran the story about the delivery of a chair we had shipped recently:</p>

<p><em>A taxi wanting to cross from Point Defiance to Tahlequah at 9:15 a.m. last Thursday was detained by Washington State Ferries.
The cab’s trunk was open, and the occupants appeared to be of Middle Eastern descent.
WSF called the police because ferry personnel are not allowed to look inside vehicles, according to WSF spokesperson Susan Harris.
She said that the police found that there was a chair in the trunk.
“In these heightened times,” Harris said, “we have potential security problems. It turned out to be no big thing.” The taxi was allowed on the boat.</em></p>

<p>The delivery people refuse to drive their truck on the ferries, so they find creative ways to get our chairs to us. What they don’t tell you is that the taxi wasn’t the only car detained, they held the ferry for 45 minutes so all the people were detained waiting for the police to arrive.</p>

<p><em>Sarcasm Mode on…</em></p>

<p>Gotta hand it to that crack team at the WSF, though. They can spot those open trunks, and they know the 100s of closed trucks and 1000s of closed trunks that ride the ferries daily certainly do not have bombs in them.</p>

<p>And of course, terrorists are trying desperately to blow up the Tahlequah ferry. Not the larger and more trafficked Fauntleroy-Vashon ferry or the even bigger Bainbridge ferries. Terrorists correctly see the tiny Tahlequah-Tacoma ferry as the linchpin to the American psyche.</p>

<p><em>…Sarcasm Mode off.</em></p>

            <p>Acccording to MSNBC, Ali Hassan Majid (“Chemical Ali”), Saddam’s cousin, has just been confirmed dead by the British military in Basra. This guy was <a href="http://www.hrw.org/press/2003/01/iraq0117.htm">vicious</a>.</p>

<p>It’s 12:30am and I’m going to sleep. The reports are that they are moving very rapidly through Baghdad at this point. I just may wake up and find that Baghdad has fallen.</p>
