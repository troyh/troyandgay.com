            <p>Normally, I wouldn’t bother too much with the status of someone’s marriage, but this is bigger than a marriage, it’s about the Tour. I’m glad that <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=ap-armstrong-marriage&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns">Lance Armstrong and his wife are reconciling</a>. I’d really like to see him win a 5th straight Tour de France this year and go on to do what no one has ever done and win a 6th next year. Did I ever mention that I met Lance at the start of Stage 2 of the Tour DuPont in 1995?</p>

            <p>I changed my mind about how I will donate my tax refund. Recipezaar and I  have benefitted an enormous amout due to the work of <a href="http://www.stallman.org/#serious">Richard Stallman</a> and the FSF. So I just became an <a href="http://member.fsf.org/">Associate Member</a> of the <a href="http://fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>From college through my career in software, I’ve benefitted from the unselfishness of people who contribute to the FSF and open source software. <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">gcc</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/">flex</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/bison.html">bison</a>, <a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a>, <a href="http://kernel.org">Linux</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">bash</a>, <a href="http://www.perl.com/">perl</a>, <a href="http://php.net">PHP</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">gmake</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vi</a>, <a href="http://openssh.org">ssh</a> and countless others are tools that I use on (almost) a daily basis today. Not only is each one of those products high quality, they are all superior to their commercial (and very expensive) counterparts. That deserves my money today, and hopefully one day I’ll be able to contribute my programming skills, which are probably worth less than the $120 I just gave, to the FSF and Open Source projects.</p>

<p>Now to find a recipient for the other $111…</p>

            <p>Saw [](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/RoadtoPerdition-1114614/)Road to Perdition last night – first dvd we’ve watched in a month or something.  Paul Newman was easily the best part of the film; he delivers several amazing speeches/lines and commands your attention every moment he is on screen.  The story is good, but it is cloddingly revealed.  Jude Law tries to act creepy and uses one too many tricks to prove it, so he just is annoying.  The cinematography is excellent – god, does it ever stop raining there – but in the end I’m completely outside the core dilemma: Newman (family before good business) v. Hanks (good business before family).  Hank’s choice let him to perdition. Mendes’s [](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/AmericanBeauty-1093536/)American Beauty was a much better movie.  As Troy says “He made American Beauty, no wonder I didn’t like this.”</p>

            <p>The mastermind behind the hijacking of the <a href="http://www.terrorismvictims.org/terrorists/achille-lauro.html">Achille Lauro</a> in 1985 was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/04/15/sprj.irq.abbas.arrested/index.html">caught today</a> in Iraq, attempting to escape into Syria.  It’s becoming more and more clear that Iraq was a supporter of terrorism. I wonder how many more of these rocks they’ll turn over in Iraq.</p>

            <p>I haven’t paid taxes since the 1999 tax year since my income has always been negative, but this year, with a slightly positive income, I am getting $231 back because of the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=96456,00.html">Earned Income Credit</a>. And it’s going to be donated to <a href="http://recipezaar.com">my favorite charity</a>.</p>
