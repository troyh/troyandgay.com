          <p>After today’s time trial, Lance is set to win his 5th straight Tour de France becoming only the second person ever to win 5 straight. And he <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/cycling/tour_de_france_2003/3099759.stm">promises to try for a 6th</a>, something nobody has ever done. He mentioned in a post-race interview that there’s some things people don’t know about this Tour, and he suggested that the team was sabatoged. When he was pulled off his bike by a fan, I wondered if it wasn’t intentional and the replays sure seemed suspicious to me. But he won and realizes that he needs to improve for next year. And Ullrich is going to come back with a much better team I’m sure.</p>

<p>And Tyler Hamilton, riding with a broken collarbone, jumped ahead 2 places in today’s time trial to take 4th overall, ahead of the undeserving and poor sportsman, Iban Mayo. I like that too.</p>

          <p>We live on Vashon, little else does.  However, one of Washington States best wineries is here (the grapes are grown in Eastern Washington and shipped here to be fermented, etc.).  So we take a little pride when <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/foodwine/2001211130_andrewwill230.html">Andrew Will winery gets a mention</a>.</p>

          <p>Gay pointed out this lyric that she liked a lot. I like it a lot too, after Gay pointed it out. And did I mention that Gay pointed it out?</p>

<p><em>The sprinklers that come on at 3am
Sound like crowds of people asking
“Are you happy what you’re doing?”</em></p>

<p>– <a href="http://www.grandaddylandscape.com/">Grandaddy</a> “The Group Who Couldn’t Say”</p>

<p>I am happy what I’m doing. I was recently talking to my dad who expressed regret that he and my mom weren’t supportive of us kids and what we wanted to do. I’m sure all parents wish they could’ve met the impossible goal of being the “perfect parents”, but I don’t see why my parents could have any regret. At 12 years old, thanks to my parents, I knew I wanted to spend my days as a programmer and I get to do it every single day, and even some nights, of my life. And sometimes I do hear the sprinklers come on at 3am, but they don’t sound like crowds of people asking me if I’m happy what I’m doing.</p>

          <p>Cringely has an <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20030724.html">idea</a> to kill the RIAA once and for all. It doesn’t make enough sense to me, though. For example, if I own 1% of a CD, do I really have the rights to listen to 100% of it? Nevertheless, it’s an interesting concept.</p>
