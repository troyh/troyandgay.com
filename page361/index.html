          <p>Gay pointed out this lyric that she liked a lot. I like it a lot too, after Gay pointed it out. And did I mention that Gay pointed it out?</p>

<p><em>The sprinklers that come on at 3am
Sound like crowds of people asking
“Are you happy what you’re doing?”</em></p>

<p>– <a href="http://www.grandaddylandscape.com/">Grandaddy</a> “The Group Who Couldn’t Say”</p>

<p>I am happy what I’m doing. I was recently talking to my dad who expressed regret that he and my mom weren’t supportive of us kids and what we wanted to do. I’m sure all parents wish they could’ve met the impossible goal of being the “perfect parents”, but I don’t see why my parents could have any regret. At 12 years old, thanks to my parents, I knew I wanted to spend my days as a programmer and I get to do it every single day, and even some nights, of my life. And sometimes I do hear the sprinklers come on at 3am, but they don’t sound like crowds of people asking me if I’m happy what I’m doing.</p>

          <p>Cringely has an <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20030724.html">idea</a> to kill the RIAA once and for all. It doesn’t make enough sense to me, though. For example, if I own 1% of a CD, do I really have the rights to listen to 100% of it? Nevertheless, it’s an interesting concept.</p>

He moved up a little in the overall standings, but probably not close enough to get on the podium at the end. But it was his first Tour stage win.</p>

          <p>Google’s new ad program is the worst thing to hit the internet since, well, since the internet. Google had a “brilliant” idea to put their text ads on sites that are targetted to the content. But they do this not by referencing their cache of pages on their own servers, but they do it by immediately doing a request to the site to find out what is on the page. So, in effect, Google doubles the load on a site immediately! There’s smart people at Google, why couldn’t they figure out that their idea was a very very bad one?</p>

<p>We have no choice but to remove Google’s ads from our site.</p>
