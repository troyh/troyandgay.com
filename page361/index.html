          </h3>
            <p>Our good friend Nicki is leaving Sunday for a 3 month trial job in New York City.  We had a lovely dinner to say goodbye last night (with friends Eric &amp; Steve as well).  This is such a great opportunity: “try out New York, no strings attached, we pay your rent…”  I’m quite jealous, and at the same time, saying goodbye always makes you realize you should spend more time with your friends before the bon voyage parties.  As an aside, we heard a HORROR story about a dinner they had at <a href="http://www.theherbfarm.com/Index2.tmpl">The Herbfarm</a>, one of Seattle’s most expensive restaurants.  For a prix fixe menu well over $100/person you would not expect servers to rudely grab unfinished plates, balk at requests for coffee, loudly announce the mistake of providing an expired credit card, to only begrudgingly provide wine information, to not accommodate outdoor smokers. …actually the list goes on…did I mention that they lectured the customers for 45 minutes before dinner on every detail of the place and the meal in such a way as to make everyone aware of just how lucky they are to be at their pretentious establishment, and yet all the gaudy restaurant decorations are not so subtlety advertised for sale – how tacky.</p>

            <p>Just two days after the cancellation of his “bet on which Americans will die next” plan, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3115135.stm">Poindexter plans to retire</a>. Poindexter is also the creator of the <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/iao/TIASystems.htm">Total Information Awareness</a> program, trying to get rid of those pesky civil rights we Americans enjoy. I guess the Bush Administration will need to find someone else to skirt The Constitution. Does <a href="http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/60.htm">Joseph McCarthy</a> have any offspring?</p>

            <p>If there was any doubt that the Pentagon enjoys death and destruction, their <a href="http://www.policyanalysismarket.org/index.html">organized betting</a> on terrorist attacks proves it. I’m sure this is just the DoD’s way of insulting the CIA &amp; FBI because, for some reason, they all hate each other, but to actually defend it is even dumber. Now, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/07/29/terrorist.market.ap/index.html">they’re going to stop it</a>, at least stop it from being public. Government at work.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2003_07_01_archive.asp#105950543265868558">William Gibson makes a good point</a>, though: “The last time DARPA got too imaginative, we wound up with the Internet. “</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/27/business/yourmoney/27WALM.html?th">Wal-Mart is a topic at business schools for all the reasons you would think</a>: case studies in channel dominance, maximizing profit by lowering costs, trucking expense, and their unbridled success.  Surprisingly it is also discussed for destroying downtowns (by moving shopping to the mall and putting mom and pops out of business), lowering the American Dream (now that the mom and pops that pay better are out of business and you have to punch a cash register at Wal-Mart for half the money, you can only afford to shop at Wal-Mart), and the prices really aren’t that low when you figure in all the costs (what you get is made cheaply and you drove farther to buy it, polluting more and contributed to our trade deficit by buying imported goods made in countries where the labor standards are are horrific).</p>

<p><em>It proves something I have been trying to teach for years: the indifferent equivalence of everything with everything else, for an audience that has no concern for that difference, and no discernment of quality.</em></p>
