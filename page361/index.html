            <p><a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/08/001617.php#001617">Gay makes a good point</a> about the oft-cited airplane scenario. I am probably in the upper-percentile of people who fly. I am on a plane 3-4 times a year. Not 3-4 times a week like the columnists and tech geeks and execs do, but still more than most people. And when I’m on a plane, I don’t use my computer at all. And I’m a geek always in front of a computer. I wouldn’t even use my laptop on a plane much if my battery did work for the entire flight. These people seem to think we’re all jet-setting around the world and living out of hotels on a daily basis and they’re ready to dismiss any technology that doesn’t handle this case flawlessly.</p>

<p>Claiming that apps need to work offline is like claiming that computers need to work without electricity. Yeah, it’d be handy, but it’s not necessary and people will survive with that requirement. Network connectivity is becoming ubiquitous. We should embrace that and push for it rather than talk like we live in 1992.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.crn.com/weblogs/stevegillmor/2003/07/28/28.asp#43577">Steve Gillmour (no relation) contemplates that if email and web browsing developed rich client apps over time so will RSS</a>.  This couldn’t be more wrong.  Ignoring the fact that e-mail started as a main frame app so of course it was all terminal emulation, client apps are only useful for creation (word, photoshop).  Email is essentially a creator and file system.  <em>This</em> is why we have developed a rich client app, and my guess is that over time web-based <em>will</em> evolve to be good enough (heck it is for most people according to the number of hotmail and yahoo addresses in my book).  RSS is really just content.  It is just stuff to read.  There is absolutely no need for a client solution except for the “read on the plane” offline case*.  My guess is that widely available wi-fi will solve this before a offline clients are common for this purpose.  Client apps are inherently poor net-citizens with their constant polling, and redundant downloading.  Disk caching helps browsing, but proxy servers are even better.  Why require each user to cache when a central server could do it better.</p>
