              <p>For anyone who runs a website this story is normal, but for the benefit of those that don’t…</p>

<p>One of our members has <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=42884">a problem with certain pages on our site which causes his browser to crash</a>.  He also has the same problem with FoodTV, so the problem is not just us, it is some code on our page which triggers a bug in IE.  We have another member with the same problem, so it is not just his particular set up either.  Obviously we want our site to work for these folks, but there is nothing further we can do.  We’ve tried to send mail or report these bugs to Microsoft before, but they simply do not have time to work on a bug that only hurts such a small number of folks, and I understand that.  If we could get their source code we could actually debug this problem ourselves and tell Microsoft exactly where the problem lies and provide them with a fix.  We have an incentive to work on this, they don’t, but we can’t fix it.</p>

<p>This is why…
<!-- more -->
…“open source” software is good.  Because anyone who has an incentive to figure out the problem can, and then they can submit the fix and hopefully make the world a better place for everyone.  Software doesn’t have to be free to be open…open is good.  You can open the hood of your car to try and fix it right? it really is no different.</p>

<p>For now, we’re just stuck.  And there is nothing further we can do to help those folks.</p>

<p><img src="http://textamerica.com/mlogs/IMG_4875/Thumb/IMG0814144403953.jpg" alt="" />Everyone knows how fast stuff spreads on the web and all that but <a href="http://blackout.textamerica.com">this site</a> allows anyone to post pictures of the blackout via email (they dumbly call them “moblogs”).  I don’t get how textamerica lets people do this for free…but whatever, it is cool.</p>

              <p>Just to dispel any doubt that Microsoft has a monopoly on desktop apps, they’re <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1012-5063546.html">pricing Office 2003</a> at up to a 33% increase in cost over the last version. Gates talks a lot about how computers are getting less expensive and he’s right, the average price of a computer is now $600. Yet the software to run it is going up and can easily double the cost of a computer if it includes Microsoft software (Windows and Office). Only a monopoly has the power to do that.</p>

<p>But people will pay it. They’ll buy the $99 DVD player over the $199 player, they’ll buy the $6 bottle of wine over the $8 bottle of wine, they’ll shop at WalMart &amp; Costco and they’ll use coupons at the grocery store and they’ll complain bitterly that the government takes taxes. But they’ll shell out the equivalent of their annual car insurance bill, enough money to buy baby food for three months, their annual cable TV bill, four dentist appointments, two car payments, eight pairs of shoes, etc. for a word processor and spreadsheet that does nothing more than the one they bought six years ago and that they use a few times a year. And they won’t even question it. And they’ll name Microsoft as the <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/030724/nyth165_1.html">#2 brand for value</a>!</p>
