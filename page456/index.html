            <p>The <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=2161">Moxi PVR</a> sounds really cool. It’ll be hard to beat TiVo’s great UI, but it’s something to watch – I’m sure we’ll be needing to upgrade or add a TiVo-like device in the not too distant future.</p>

            <p>Got up on the roof and cleaned the gutters. Removed a lot of standing water but the leaves are still too wet to take down, so I just swept them out of the way and into piles.</p>

            <p>Yet another online grocer, <a href="http://freshdirect.com">FreshDirect</a> with a <a href="http://www.fortune.com/indexw.jhtml?channel=artcol.jhtml&amp;doc_id=210233">Fortune article</a> on it. Same model as WebVan but on a smaller scale (Manhattan area only). The founder also founded a grocery store in Manhattan in the early 90s that was known for extremely fresh produce. FreshDirect seems to follow the same model but also has fresh-baked stuff. I do like the little food icons they use. :)</p>

            <p>We worked on the new Talk until 7 or so and then went to Bishop’s for dinner. We came home, watched some TiVo and went to bed. Got up early (6am) thanks to the dogs and my pager going off (MySQL connections maxed out). Need to finish the new Talk stuff and get it up tonight. I’d like to relax tomorrow.</p>

            <p>Dan Bricklin’s <a href="http://danbricklin.com/log/tabletpc.htm">first impressions</a> on the TabletPC. In short, he likes it because it’s named “TabletPC”, but it really sucks, he just won’t admit it. Typical geek-boy fascination.</p>
