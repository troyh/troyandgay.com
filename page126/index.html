          <p>I happen to find “this blog”:http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/11/kindle-20-to-hi.html on Wired.com googling for “Kindle 2.0” and thought the photo was familiar. It turns “it’s one of mine”:http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2584801338/. At least he credited me with the photo.<a href="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/picture-11.png"><img src="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/picture-11.png" alt="" /></a></p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>The Seattle Post-Intelligencer “published a story”:http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/394617_shippingwoes03.html about the delivery problems with UPS and FedEx in Seattle, linking to this site, even including my lazily-titled “Seattle UPS finished sucking (for me, at least)”. Nice. But it blames the problems on the snowy and icy roads and Seattle’s government, but that’s incorrect, at least in my case. UPS and FedEx could both deliver to our house in the days before Christmas while several other packages were sitting in the UPS hub in Seattle. The problem was that the packages were not put on the trucks making deliveries in our area. In some cases, packages were taken off trucks and not put back on for a over a week! It’s not the roads or the weather, it’s a logistical problem at Seattle’s UPS hub and an inability to efficiently deal with a backlog of packages. It can’t be explained any other way.</p>

<p>The article also fails to point out that 2nd Day Air packages are not delivered any faster than Ground deliveries. In my case, 2nd Day Air “seemed to be lower-priority”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/12/30/seattle-ups-finished-sucking-for-me-at-least/ than Ground! If you read through the comments on “my original post”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/12/29/seattle-ups-sucks/ and “on the Seattle PI’s article”:http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/soundoff/comment.asp?articleID=394584, others saw the same results. I’d love to hear UPS’ explanation for that.</p>

<p>The article also mentions UPS spokespeople claiming that they have no idea how many packages are in the backlog, as if that excuses their failures. Think about that, UPS tracks every package with tracking numbers that are recorded in their computer system and can be tracked on their route around the country, but they have no way to <em>count</em> them?!? I wouldn’t have believed that even if the two customer service reps I talked to gave me counts. One said there were 60,000 packages and another said 10,000 packages an hour later. Obviously, those numbers are made up too because they didn’t deliver 50,000 packages between the two calls I made. When I questioned the discrepancy, I was told that the 10,000 figure was the last update they have – they do have counts for the backlog, apparently. So either UPS’ customer service reps are lying to customers and UPS has no way to count packages to be delivered, or the spokespeople used in this article are lying that they can’t count them.</p>

          <p>My highlights of 2008, in chronological order:</p>

<p>I’m not much of a car person, but “buying a Lexus LS 460”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/01/05/new-car-2008-lexus-ls-460/ was a treat. It’s still a pleasure to drive and we took it to “Cannon Beach, Oregon”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/01/11/drive-to-cannon-beach-oregon/, “California”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/19/los-gatos-to-eugene-oregon/, “Vancouver”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/18/vancouver-3/ and “Whistler”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/19/whistler/. I hope to use it to take more driving trips in 2009. We took a “trip to Mexico”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/02/01/mexico-vacation/, not in the car, which was relaxing because we spent most of the time doing nothing.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>“Havana learned to walk”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/04/16/havana-walking/, we celebrated “her 1st birthday”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/04/30/happy-birthday-havana/ and “threw her a party”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/03/havanas-1st-birthday-party/. She’s really grown-up this year and I have a lot of fun playing with her and watching her learn.</p>

<p>We took a “trip to Florida”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/04/14/florida-trip/. I didn’t (and still don’t) like Florida much at all, but it was good to see my parents, brother and sister-in-law.</p>

<p>“Getting a Kindle for Father’s Day”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/06/15/fathers-day-2008/ has encouraged me to read a lot more and I’ve done that. I read 20 or 25 books this year, which must be a record for me. I wish I had it on all the trips we took this year, it’d be great for traveling! I hope to continue to read books at a steady rate in 2009 because I’ve got quite a stack of books waiting for me.</p>

<p>“Hudson’s birth”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/25/hudsons-birth/ was one of the two biggest highlights of my life, and certainly of the year. Two years ago I didn’t have any kids and today I’m the father of <em>two</em> kids. He’s only 4 months old so he’s just starting the period where he will grow up quickly. 2009 should be a lot of fun with him and Havana.</p>

<p>We gave ourselves “4th wedding anniversary presents”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/12/anniversary-presents/ that I hope to have forever. I don’t have many keepsakes, these are precious ones.</p>

<p>“My 39th birthday”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/11/01/troys-birthday/ was my usual quiet affair, the way I like it. Hitting 39 is only a highlight because I’m not yet 40.</p>

<p>Ah, politics was big this year. Being a Hillary Clinton supporter, it wasn’t looking good for a while there, but I really enjoyed “the beginning of McCain’s implosion”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/30/mccain-proves-he-is-a-moron/ and the many shockingly stupid mistakes he made. The finale with an “Obama victory”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/11/05/obama/ will be a moment I doubt I’ll ever forget. Not since 1992 have I felt more optimistic about America.</p>

<p>Finally, my favorite holiday, “Thanksgiving”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/11/27/thanksgiving-2008/, reminded me of everything I have to be thankful for.</p>

<p>The lowlight of the year was “Ouzo dying”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/09/11/ouzo-1999-2008/, on 9/11, of all days. I miss him.</p>

<p>My beers of the year were “Deschutes’ The Abyss”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/29/deschutes-brewerys-the-abyss/, “Raison D’Extra”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/24/dogfish-head-raison-dextra/, the second of which I plan to have tonight for New Year’s Eve, and “Stone Imperial Russian Stout”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/07/03/stone-imperial-russian-stout/, which I did have two of this year.</p>

<p>Best music of the year: Coldplay’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RPTQ1C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000RPTQ1C">Viva La Vida</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000RPTQ1C" alt="" /> (say what you will, it’s a great album), Colin Meloy’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013P6TK6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013P6TK6">Colin Meloy Sings Live!</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0013P6TK6" alt="" />, Ryan Adams’ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GJ7ZMK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001GJ7ZMK">Cardinology</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001GJ7ZMK" alt="" />, Decemberists <em>Always the Bridesmaid</em> EPs, Mogwai <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CVCBLM?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001CVCBLM">Hawk Is Howling</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001CVCBLM" alt="" />, Sigur Ros <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ACY8D2?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001ACY8D2">Med Sud I Eyrum Vid Spilum Endalaust</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001ACY8D2" alt="" />.</p>

<p>Best books of the year:</p>

<p>Easily the best book I read all year was Alice Schroeder’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553805096?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0553805096">The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0553805096" alt="" />. I couldn’t put this book (the Kindle, actually) down, often staying up until 1am until I couldn’t keep my eyes open. Warren Buffett is an interesting and quirky guy with an obsession, collecting money, which almost completely destroys his personal relationships.</p>

<p>John Bogle’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470398515?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0470398515">Enough: True Measures of Money, Business, and Life</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0470398515" alt="" />, which is less repetitive than previous books and a good message for us all.</p>

<p>Tom Perkins’ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592404030?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1592404030">Valley Boy: The Education of Tom Perkins</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1592404030" alt="" />. Love him or hate him, he invented modern venture capital, which has had an enormously positive impact on the world we live in. He’s had an interesting personal life too.</p>

<p>Steven Landsburg’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416532226?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1416532226">More Sex Is Safer Sex: The Unconventional Wisdom of Economics</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1416532226" alt="" />, always a fun economics writer. I love his proof that an increasing population is good for the world and his simple argument against black-and-white thinking that seems to pervade society today: arguing for extreme solutions, rather than middle-ground solutions, is akin to concluding that, because eating less will make you lose weight and live longer, eating nothing will make you live forever.</p>

<p>The other book I couldn’t put down until I finished it was James Conaway’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618257985?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0618257985">Napa: The Story of an American Eden</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0618257985" alt="" />. Who knew the rise of Napa Valley was so colorful, political and downright fascinating?</p>

<p>Robert Mondavi’s inspiring companion to Conaway’s <em>Napa</em> (and partial attempt at modesty), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0156010569?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0156010569">Harvests of Joy: How the Good Life Became Great Business</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0156010569" alt="" />. Sadly, Robert Mondavi died this year.</p>

<p>Thomas Friedman’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374166854?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0374166854">Hot, Flat, and Crowded: Why We Need a Green Revolution–and How It Can Renew America</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0374166854" alt="" />, which I haven’t yet finished, but it’s a page-turner, even if I’m not convinced by all his points.</p>

<p>Matthew Bishop’s and Michael Green’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1596913746?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1596913746">Philanthrocapitalism: How the Rich Can Save the World</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1596913746" alt="" />, just for insight into the difficulties of effective philanthropy.</p>

<p>I (half-heartedly) recommend Eric Weiner’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/044669889X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=044669889X">The Geography of Bliss: One Grump’s Search for the Happiest Places in the World</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=044669889X" alt="" />, not because of any wisdom it gives, but because it’s an example of the futility of searching for happiness outside yourself.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2008/12/31/seattle-ups-finished-sucking-for-me-at-least.html">Seattle UPS finished sucking (for me, at least)</a>
        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>The last of my packages from Christmas were finally delivered today as well as a few more that I didn’t have tracking numbers for that were also delayed for a long time. After “I posted about my problems”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/12/29/seattle-ups-sucks/, several people posted their similar stories. “The Kitsap Sun”:http://www.kitsapsun.com/news/2008/dec/30/ups-still-working-on-holiday-backlog/, a tiny newspaper (way) outside of Seattle, is the only place I’ve seen this story covered in the local media.</p>

<p>What is amazing to me about UPS is how poorly they handled this. Lots of packages for Christmas is not new to UPS and neither is weather. As bad as the weather was in Seattle, it wasn’t <em>that</em> bad and certainly minor compared to the weather they get in other parts of the country. They obviously don’t have a system in place to handle a case like this.</p>

<p>Severe weather can be understood and customers are generally forgiving of unusual circumstances, but only if the company can communicate effectively. UPS can’t. Their customer service, in my experience, was dismissive of the problem and was not interested in finding a solution for me and expressed absolutely no interest in improving the company for such situations in the future. As another sign of a company with problems, UPS in California “had to apologize for labeling a customer a terrorist”:http://www.turnto23.com/north_river_county/18385526/detail.html because he wore a turban. These problems are caused by poor management – employees are powerless and uninformed, suggestions for improving the company are clearly not welcome and their is little evidence of pride in being a UPS employee. UPS is unlikely to ever be a great company.</p>

<p>Here’s my updated list of deliveries, clearly 2nd Day Air got short shrift:</p>

<p>Ground packages were idle in Seattle for an average of 6.67 days, 2nd Day Air packages were idle for 8.67 days, or 30% longer even though it cost twice as much to send them 2nd Day Air. If/when I ever ship anything UPS, I’ll never choose anything but UPS Ground – it’s cheaper and higher-priority.</p>

          <p>Humans are lousy at making correct rational decisions in life. The brain is easily tricked by things that only matter to the irrational part of the brain. For example, people prefer to get $50 now rather than $60 one month later because being patient is rational. When told an item is now on sale, people think they’re getting a good deal even though they wouldn’t have paid the sale price before finding out about the sale. People fear terrorism but not swimming pools even though you are many many more times likely to die in a swimming pool than in a terrorist attack (this is also why terrorism is so powerful a tool).</p>

<p>The author of the great book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400077427?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1400077427">Stumbling on Happiness</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1400077427" alt="" />, gave a talk at TED that talks about these things:</p>

<p>One of the points he makes is about comparison-shopping. This is something I learned years ago. Just in the last year, I’ve had several conversations about people who are thinking about buying a new TV. When I tell them that I just go to Amazon.com, sort by best-selling, read the reviews of several items and buy one, they think that’s dumb. They believe going to the store to compare TVs side-by-side is the smart way to select a TV. I always say “But when you’re at home watching it, you never remember that other TV in the store”. I think I save a lot of money (and time!) this way and Daniel Gilbert explains why.</p>
