              <p>I am program managing our wedding, so my schedule and phone now acts like a very busy person’s.  It is incredibly fun, and I am very excited.  The world will not know or appreciate the how difficult it was to iron out certain details, it will just seem “nice”.  I will know the number of phone calls and connections it took to nail down the keg and the special English tap it required in order for my fiance to have his favorite beer at his wedding or the connections dragged out for us to get a last minute dancing lesson so “our song” (whatever it turns out to be in the next 48 hours) will look natural, and the numerous small decisions about color lights and placements of paper lanterns and christmas lights to make the whole place glow…and don’t get me started on the opinionated calculus to determine the number of water bottles, tonic water and bourbon to make it through.  Right now, it doesn’t matter.  Bring on the relatives, I’m ready to wed!</p>

              <p>I installed <a href="http://isg.ee.ethz.ch/tools/postgrey/">Postgrey</a> on our mail server yesterday and, to my surprise, cut our spam down to close to zero! I used to get hundreds of spams a day, but since yesterday, I’ve received two, both from the same sender. The (Bayesian) junk mail filter on my mail client did an admirable job, but I still had plenty of spam in my inbox to annoy me. I’m amazed that such a simple mechanism like <a href="http://greylisting.org">greylisting</a> actually works.</p>

              <p><a href="http://sippey.com/b/2004/06/where-does-rss-belong.html">It’s true</a>, reading news is best done in your browser, not in an email-like application. Geeks today adopting RSS love the “email model” because they live in email, and really bad 7-pane (!) email clients like Outlook, to boot. But the masses will read news in their browser. And yes, RSS replaces the act of web browsing.</p>

              <p>You know what is scary about America? Not McDonald’s. Not Budweiser. Not that <a href="http://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2003/01/31/how_many_america.php">so few Americans have passports</a> or venture outside the US borders. Not even that Americans watch Bill O’Reilly, <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/002046.shtml">a raving idiot who distorts facts and spouts outright lies</a>. What’s scary is that Americans believe morons like Bill O’Reilly. People believe what they want to believe, the facts are nuisances.</p>

              <p>Gay has done the majority (all) of the work in planning the wedding so far. But even though it’s been all her, that doesn’t mean it’s easy on me (poor poor Troy!). Making any wedding-type decision for a man is far more painful than for a woman. ;) But that aside, I highly recommend eloping if you’re thinking of planning a wedding. Weddings are a scam…. try it yourself, call a photographer to take some photos and they’ll charge $100/hr. Mention “wedding” and the price is suddenly $500/hr, if not more. Same for everything else. My advice: set your budget, halve, and halve it again. You’ll end up paying your original budget in the end.</p>

<p>But I do have my jobs… aside from my suit, I have to get the beer (!) and handle the music setup. We’re not doing a band, we’re doing music streamed from our laptops. Which also means I’ve been selecting the music. I don’t know what I’d do without the internet; I don’t want to buy Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, any 80’s one-hit wonder CDs, or any stuff my parents like (Kenny Rogers, Dolly Parton, etc.) because I just want a song or two. Thanks to P2P, I’ve got a nice set of wedding music.  And I don’t know how I’d do this without a computer; just 5 years ago and I’d have to hire a DJ to swap CDs all night. But now I can just set up playlists that mix nicely all by itself, and if our friends want to, they can do their own DJing at our wedding. Technology!</p>
