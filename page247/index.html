            <p>So the term “October Surprise” was “invented by Republicans in 1980”:http://slate.com/id/2108884/ to pre-empt something that never happened. What is it with Republicans and preemption? Why are they so scared of the future? Why do we still talk about an October Surprise? Why do I ask so many rhetorical questions today?</p>

          </h3>
            <p>So bin Laden (yes, he’s <em>still</em> alive!) released a videotape today. In March 2002, Bush “said he’s not concerned with bin Laden”:http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/03/20020313-8.html (“video”:http://homepage.mac.com/njenson/movies/notconcerned.html). Is he concerned about him now? If not, when? If he’s not concerned about him, should we be concerned about him?</p>

          </h3>
            <p>“Online publishers warn about Google”:http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/story1120.shtml. And they’re right. Google is fast becoming a monopoly on search so it controls what people find on the web. And Google’s PageRank algorithm tends toward stagnation of the rankings, making it more difficult for new sites to break in. One critic points out that “The web should be more about small players having an equal hand.” and Google’s rep responds with “I don’t think [big publishers] will be losing sleep about threats from small publishers”. Exactly. But the promise of the web was that they should be. Google, by their own admission, is anti-web.</p>
