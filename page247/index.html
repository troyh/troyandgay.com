            <p>I love my iPod. I love my Mac. I love Apple. I love my digital camera. I love technology. And Steve Jobs is 100% right that video on the iPod is a dumb idea. But I’ve been trying to figure out why I would want the “iPod Photo”:http://apple.com/ipodphoto. I can’t download my photos from my camera straight to the iPod Photo, so it’s not a replacement for a laptop on vacation (even if I didn’t want my laptop on vacation). Never in my life have I ever (or even wanted to) go to a friend’s house to show them my photos on their TV – I believe the only person who wants to see the majority of my photos is me. I already have TiVo that does the slideshows on my own TV, even if I were inclined to move the dock from my desktop to my TV or go find the cable to plug into the TV. And I really don’t understand why someone would want to carry 25,000 photos around.</p>

<p>But I’m sure the iPod Photo will sell like crazy. What are people going to really do with it?</p>

            <p>Crime is going down in the US, which is good, except that “murders are going up”:http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=542&amp;u=/ap/20041025/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/fbi_violent_crime_6&amp;printer=1. In 2003, 16,503 people were murdered in the US.</p>

<p>In other words, we <em>know</em> that  16,000+ Americans will be murdered next year. But, as a nation, we fear the unlikely event of a terrorist attack that will kill far fewer people some years from now. Americans expect the unlikely and ignore the guaranteed…. I guess that explains why Americans buy lottery tickets, which is something else I’ve never understood.</p>

            <p>Christian Science Monitor’s article “How bin Laden Got Away”:http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0304/p01s03-wosc.html: “In retrospect, it becomes clear that the battle’s underlying story is of how scant intelligence, poorly chosen allies, and dubious military tactics fumbled a golden opportunity to capture bin Laden as well as many senior Al Qaeda commanders.”</p>
