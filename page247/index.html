This place is a hotel without the rooms. It’s an extremely trendy place with extremely trendy customers. It sits right on the beach and has sunbathers and people lounging around on the seats. In fact, it’s not possible to not lounge on the seats, they’re just benches with thick cushions on them. I imagine the concept for the place is to attract people who are staying at low-end hotels or hotels not on the beach so they created a place where you can hang out all day and be served drinks. The exciting thing is that they have <a href="http://makersmark.com">Maker’s Mark</a>; this is the first time we’ve seen it here so we had to have a manhattan. We had a couple drinks and watched the surfers and the sunset before moving to the dining area for dinner. If you look closely, you can see surfers out in the water.</p>

<p>Dinner was excellent. I had braised lamb neck and Gay had the saffron seafood risotto. For the first time in Bali, I felt like I was not in Bali – the only Indonesians were the staff.</p>

<p>After dinner, we came back to the hotel and swam in the (heated?) pool and then to bed. We’ve been getting up at about 6:30am every day so by 9pm, we’re ready for bed, and in an air-conditioned room. I’m going to try to get on a similar schedule at home, although 9pm is still too early for me to go to bed.</p>

        <article>
          <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_1996.jpg" alt="IMG_1996.jpg" />We rode to Seminyak this morning from Ubud. The drive took about 45 minutes, although if there was no traffic on the roads, it’d have taken maybe 15. Driving in Bali is pretty tough due to the masses of motorcycles and mopeds on the roads. Cars are constantly passing them, so it’s almost like there’s 3 lanes in the road which makes head-on collisions seem inevitable.</p>

<p>Along the way we ran into a procession to a cremation ceremony, so we pulled over and snapped a few photos. From what we understand, everyone is cremated in Indonesia and then the ashes are buried in cemeteries. When someone dies, they spend three days preparing the grounds for the ceremony and then the entire town gets dressed up and marches to the cremation grounds where the cremation is done. In contrast to western funerals, Indonesian funerals are lively events.</p>

<p>Speaking of non-western Indonesian customs, we’ve learned that Indonesians don’t make a big deal out of meals. In fact, families don’t eat meals together – the mother typically prepares food and leaves it in the kitchen all day for family members to eat when they want to. One of the expats we met told us that if you’re invited to a Indonesian’s house for dinner, the food is served buffet-style and you take some and eat it by yourself, usually in the corner. Very strange. I thought all cultures made food a key part of social events. It just goes to show that there’s an exception to every rule.</p>

<p>We arrived at our hotel, <a href="http://www.oberoihotels.com/resortdetails.asp?hi_id=19&amp;hotelcode=TXL-OB-HBDPSOB&amp;hl_id=5">The Oberoi</a>. Now this is a hotel! Even better than the Four Seasons, I think. And we once again have the privacy we wanted that we didn’t really have in Ubud. This should be a relaxing way to end our honeymoon. :)  The only drawback is the lack of WiFi internet in the room, we have to go to the “library” to get internet access. But we still have dialup through <a href="http://www.telkom.net.id/">TelkomNet</a>, which seems to provide free dialup to everyone – we’re using the same phone number, account name and password that they provide on their site. Free dialup internet in Indonesia. Go figure.</p>

<p>A nice thing about Seminyak is that we can walk into town and to the restaurants and shops. No scheduling a driver here. And it sounds like there’s lots of good restaurants here, including a <a href="http://www.indomykonos.com/">Greek restaurant</a> that we’ve heard good things about.</p>

After a morning of lounging by the pool (again), we went to the Monkey Forest in Ubud. I was hesitant to go to see the monkeys because I thought it was soooo touristy and would be disappointing. But it was incredibly fun! I’ve seen monkeys on TV, of course, but nothing compares to seeing them in real life… it struck me how human they behave. It’s those opposable thumbs that make all the difference!</p>

<p>We bought bananas to feed them and boy do they go after them. The young ones are aggressive in the way they grab them from you (they have to be quick, or the big monkeys win) but the older monkeys are very polite – you can just hand it to them. Not thinking, I assumed I had to peel the bananas for them and the first monkey was not patient while I did that so Gay explained that they know how to peel the banana. And they do… they peel it just like a human, it’s just amazing to watch.
We took almost 100 photos and a few mini-movies, we couldn’t get enough. We can’t post them all here yet, but when we get back we will.</p>

<p>Then we stopped in at the <a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/forward.weml?property_name=sayan&amp;">Four Seasons in Sayan</a> for a drink just to see what it was like. From the rooftop (a lotus pond) we could see the villa we were staying in. And the bar itself was beautifully designed.</p>

<p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_1974.jpg" alt="IMG_1974.jpg" /></p>

<p>Then back to Nuri’s for dinner, a delicious steak, and we met even more expats, one from the US even. The Canadian guy living in Bali, when he heard we are from Seattle, gave us an earful about Microsoft and their “crappy products that never work”. I always find it interesting to experience the visceral negative reaction to Microsoft among non-tech people. He was embarrassed, but still adamant, when he found out we used to work at Microsoft, but was happy to hear we use Macs (he’s a film documentary-maker so he uses Macs to edit his video) . ;) An Australian, who seemed half-insane, was fun to listen to. And Brian was an hospitable host once again. :) If you go to Nuri’s, ask what isn’t on the menu because we found out after we had dinner that they also serve cheesesteaks!</p>

          <p>We’re both getting tired of Ubud. So we spent most of the day at the villa by the pool and reading. Fortunately, the chainsaws were only running part of the day. We went into Ubud for lunch and came right back home for more nothing-doing. And it was a humid day with little or no breeze. I was sweating just sitting in a chair and couldn’t drink enough water. This is DC-style humidity. I’m ready to see the beach (and the breeze off the water) again.</p>
