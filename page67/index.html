          </h3>
            <p><strong>The National <em>High Violet</em></strong></p>

<p>If the Great American Novel had a soundtrack, I think this would be it. This is not only one of my favorite albums of 2010, but one of my favorite albums in my life, ranking up there with Rush’s “Moving Pictures”, Nirvana’s “Nevermind” and Radiohead’s “OK Computer”, albums I played on repeat for a long time and still listen to today. It sounds like cut-and-dried rock on the first several listens, but there’s a lot of subtlety and odd changing drum beats, which always hook me and I really like his voice. Favorites: it’s a perfect album so all songs are great, but “Sorrow”, “Little Faith”, “Afraid of Everyone”, “Conversation 16” and “England” are especially good.</p>

<p><strong>Jonsi <em>Go</em></strong></p>

<p>This is the solo album from one of the founders of Sigur Ros, an Icelandic band that we like. This album is more approachable than Sigur Ros and more pop-oriented, but still good and has that Sigur Ros atmospheric sound. Favorites: “Animal Arithmetic”, “Tornado”, “Boy Lilikoi”, “Kolnidur”, “Grow Till Tall”, “Hengilas”.</p>

<p><strong>Belle &amp; Sebastian <em>Write About Love</em></strong></p>

<p>It’s an alternative cliché, I guess, to like Belle &amp; Sebastian and I look like an aging art school nerd for holding onto this band for all these years, but I can’t help liking them. I think this is their best album since their 2000 album, “Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like A Peasant”.  Favorites: “I Didn’t See It Coming”, “Calculating Bimbo”, “I Want The World To Stop”, “Read The Blessed Pages”.</p>

<p><strong>Arcade Fire <em>Suburbs</em></strong></p>

<p>Their first album in 2004, “Funeral”, was amazing and it’s taken them this long to make something as good. I think their albums run together as one long song so it’s hard to pick out individual songs, but I’ll try: “The Suburbs”, “Modern Man”, “City With No Children”,  ”Half Light II”, “Suburban War”, “We Used To Wait”, “Sprawl II”.</p>

<p><strong>Gorillaz <em>Plastic Beach</em></strong></p>

<p>I generally don’t like rap and hip-hop, but if Damon Albarn makes it, I like it. I even like the Snoop Dogg track, which I would’ve guessed would be impossible. Favorites: “Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach”, “Rhinestone Eyes”, “Stylo”, “Empire Ants”, “Broken”, “Plastic Beach”, “On Melancholy Hill”.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Gay and I got Illy in 1999 from <a href="http://www.pslra.org/html/rescue.htm">Lab Rescue</a>. She was 4 years old and was being given away by her owners because the mother developed terminal cancer and couldn’t care for her anymore. They got her as a puppy and their child grew up with her for the first few years of their life. Lab Rescue told us that they had tried a few times to let her go and canceled at the last minute each time because they didn’t want her to go. We feel the same.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/22000136/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/15/22000136_0efd970355.jpg" alt="Illy" /></a></p>

<p>When we met her at the foster house she was spry. She even played fetch with me, something she never did since. We put her in the back of the Jeep and drove her home. On the way, we realized our getting a dog wasn’t well-planned and we didn’t have anything at home for her. We stopped at a pet supply chain, Petco, for some supplies. We got a collar, dog dish, food, etc and continued to home.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Her original name was Maggie, but we didn’t like the name. We read that to change a dog’s name it’s best to change it to one that rhymed and with the same number of syllables so the dog would have an easier time learning it. We tried several names on her and she didn’t respond to any of them. One day, while trying names on for size, I saw a can of Illy coffee on the counter. It rhymed and, like Maggie, had 2 syllables so I tried saying “Illy!”. Her head perked up right away and she looked at me waiting for my next word. Success! Her new name was Illy.</p>

<p>Illy was always well-behaved. She was house-broken, she was good with people, she didn’t bark unnecessarily and she didn’t chew on furniture. But whenever we left the house, she’d be up on the couch by the time the door closed. We could see her through the window by the door that she was relaxing on the couch and we’d yell through the window to get off the couch. She ignored us and we gave up even trying after a few days. She could do anything she wanted and we’d still think it was cute.</p>

<p>When we quit our jobs and started our own business out of the 2nd bedroom, she would lay right in the middle of the room behind our chairs. We’d constantly slide our chairs into her and she’d just pick her head up and look at us. After a year of living in close quarters like that, we decided we needed a bigger place to live and work. Long story short, we bought a house on Vashon Island.</p>

<p>The new house had a big yard and Illy had no one to play with. We decided we should get another dog for her. We got <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2008/09/11/ouzo-1999-2008/">Ouzo</a> and Illy pretended like he didn’t exist.  He loved Illy, though. He loved being with her, he always let her have food before trying to get it and he always let her go through doors ahead of him. I think she secretly like him, but she never showed it – she wasn’t a dog person.</p>

<p>In the new house, we had a bigger shared office, but she still sat close enough to us to be hit by a chair sliding out unexpectedly. She was never far from us. She was not overly affectionate, but she preferred to be near us than far from us for no apparent reason. If we moved to another room, she’d come over and lay by our feet. If we were in separate rooms, she’d lay where she could see both of us. When we left the house, she’d watch us leave and would wait by the door until we got back. Getting to the office required her to climb up a staircase and down another. She did this every day. Even when she was so arthritic it took her 10 minutes to climb the stairs and she struggled to get down the other staircase, she came up to the office so she could lay near us. And after Havana and Hudson were born and their lunches were served in the kitchen, she’d make the referse trek back to kitchen every single day to see if there were any scraps of food that might fall on the floor. The last few years, she needed help climbing stairs so she needed help. At first, it was just words of encouragement: “Go Illy go! Go Illy go!”. As time went on, I’d have to pick up her rear legs and put them on the first step to get her started. Before she gave up climbing stairs altogether, I had to hold her rear legs up while she pulled herself up the stairs with her front legs.</p>

<p>As she approached 15 in November, she was slowing down. She was as good as deaf, she couldn’t see very far, not even far enough to find food on the floor, and she struggled just to walk due to her arthritis. Soon after turning 15, she deteriorated rapidly. She experienced <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2010/12/07/illys-sick/">another bout of dizziness</a> that she only partialy recovered from. She wouldn’t eat or drink so the vet gave her an IV to get her nutrition back. She was improving for a day or two but stopped eating and drinking again. She couldn’t get up on her own anymore and could barely control her bowels. The vet suggested some things to try but also reminded us of her age. We held out hope that she’d improve and have a few more weeks or months more.</p>

<p>She only got worse. I’d pick her up and help her walk outside to go the bathroom but she couldn’t stand up long enough to finish and she’d fall down. She started vomiting often and we’d wake up to her dried vomit and a wet bed. We decided that her quality of life was not very good and it was time to let her go.</p>

<p>We’ll miss you, Illy.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>She was born today at 2:47pm, 7 lbs 14 ounces, 19 inches. The labor was smooth and uneventful, a little quicker than Havana and a little slower than Hudson. She and Gay are doing well.</p>

<p>P.S. Her first name is pronounced like Eva Peron and Eva Gabor, not like Eva Longoria. :-)

            <a class="post-link" href="/our%20life/2010/12/12/mudslide.html">Mudslide</a>
          </h3>
            <p>Our neighbor, who is not neighborly, came to our house this morning with another unfriendly neighbor with shovels in their hands. They live down by the water about 200-300 feet below us. They told us that there was a mudslide that affected the road that runs down to their houses. They said they brought shovels to “redirect the stream of water running off our property” that caused the mudslide.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5265337034/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5201/5265337034_61c6bdb638.jpg" alt="Mudslide" /></a></p>

<p>What they didn’t realize is that Seattle had record rainfall for the last few days and their were mudslides all over the county and our mudslide was one of many (and not very significant). They thought that ours wasn’t caused by heavy rain, but by some kind of river that we made that is running over the edge of our property. When they realized that there wasn’t any water running over the edge, they left promising, in a threatening way, to “be back!”. Ooh, scary.

Background on these women: one woman has never seen what happened on 9/11 because, as she proudly declares, they don’t own a television, as if anyone who owns a television isn’t as enlightened as she is. Classic Vashon. The other friend didn’t like our dog because she barked at her car when she drove by our house so one day when she didn’t realize I was watching, she drove really slowly by our house, waited for Illy to walk over (she’s old, it takes her a while) and had her kid spray something (I don’t know what it was; I hope just water) from a spray bottle at her when she got near enough. I ran down the driveway when I saw that and she sped off. She was teaching her kid how to be cruel to animals, I guess. Classic Vashole. I shouldn’t be surprised that they don’t understand what heavy rain and gravity does to steep slopes.</p>

<p>I called the husband of one of these women to talk about the slide rationally. He apologized for his wife’s attitude that morning and we had a decent conversation about what to do to prevent any more damage.</p>

<p>In summary, they needed a favor from us and their first idea was to come at us aggressively demanding it. When that didn’t work, they decided to be polite.</p>

<p>Update: We had a geotech come over the next morning to look at the slide. He was unimpressed. In fact, he was concerned the road below because it is filled with cracks, meaning that slides are imminent below the road. He suggested putting straw down on our slope to prevent any more sediment from coming down, but as expected, he just said that this is life on a steep slope and you can’t fight nature and gravity. I called the neighbor to report what the geotech said and left a voice mail message. I never heard a thing, I assume because we haven’t had much rain since and there haven’t been any more slides. I imagine they’ll just wait for the next problem to react to (and be angry at us over) rather than try to be proactive. The motto of the ignorant: blame everyone else for your problems and expect others to solve them for you. I just hope that no one is driving a car on their road when it gives out.</p>
