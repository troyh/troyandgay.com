It includes Volunteer Park Cafe, which is just a couple blocks from our house in “one of Seattle’s oldest and prettiest neighborhoods.”</p>

<p>This reminds me, we just found out from one of the children of the previous owner of our house that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Nickels">Greg Nickels</a>, the previous Mayor of Seattle, grew up right next door to our house.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Gay met with the interior designers for round 2 of their plans. After <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/03/03/furniture-fabrics/">the first round</a>, we felt we were pretty far away from something we liked. But this one is much closer. We still need to find out how much some of the things cost before committing to them and we need to convince ourselves that some of the furniture is worth the price, but for the most part, we like the paint colors, fabrics and most of the furniture.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5559138760/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5188/5559138760_678bc5f3a0.jpg" alt="Foyer" /></a></p>

<p>She also met with the landscape designer to see round 2 of that. Again, we’re very close to finishing that design. We need to get a better idea of the cost of things and make some minor adjustments.</p>

<p>She also saw the fireplace installed and talked to the tile guy about laying out the kitchen tile. No decision is simple; deciding where the full tiles should be and where the partial tiles should be in the room is always a trade-off and the tile guy doesn’t quite agree with the interior designers, so the decision ends up with us.</p>

              <p>Kelly could work late to watch the kids so we could go out to dinner for <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/03/22/happy-birthday-gay-4/">Gay’s birthday</a>. We left at 1pm, went to the house to check on progress and then to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=roche+bobois+seattle&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=roche+bobois&amp;hnear=Seattle,+WA&amp;cid=1891254643517170645">Roche-Bobois</a> downtown to look at a sectional that the designers suggested. We checked out a couple other furniture stores near there and then made our way to <a href="http://www.tavernlaw.com/">Tavern Law</a> for a drink before dinner.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I made a reservation at <a href="http://www.spinasse.com/">Cascina Spinasse</a> for 6:30p and they stressed to me that they can’t hold a reservation so we had to be there promptly at 6:30p. A couple days earlier, I had secretly emailed some of Gay’s friends telling them they can meet us at Tavern Law at 5:30 for a drink if they were nearby. I didn’t know how long we’d be at the bar, so I was worried it’d be hard to make our reservation on time. That turned out to be true, we ended up staying at the bar with everyone until after 7.</p>

<p>Gay was surprised to see her friends showing up and some of her friends were surprised it was a surprise. I’m terrible at planning Gay’s birthdays because my ideal birthday (actually, my ideal day) is having a quiet dinner at home but Gay likes to be out and about celebrating with people. Reid, Marissa, Megan, Jon, Stephanie, Matt and Renuka all made it and we practically filled the tiny place. Technically, Alex and Niles made it too, but they misread my confusing mail and showed up the previous night (and emailed me asking where we were).</p>

<p>For dinner, We ended up just walking up the street to <a href="http://www.barriorestaurant.com/">Barrio</a>, which we saw on our way to Tavern Law and liked the looks of the place – big steel doors, thick wood tables, etc. This place has a very cool interior with an amazing wall of candles (that apparently takes 45 minutes to light). As we sat down, Kelly texted Gay and said that Havana and Hudson both had diarrhea so Gay was anxious about that, but Kelly assured her that they’re fine. We had a good dinner and made the 10:20p ferry home.</p>

              <p>Gay turned 41 today. It’s the first time since 2008 that we celebrated her birthday at home. I made dinner tonight and we’re going out to dinner tomorrow night.</p>

<p>She’s more wise, more fun and more beautiful than the day I met her. I met her just before she turned 27. She was successful and a powerful personality at Microsoft then, a difficult thing in a male-dominant environment like Microsoft at the time, and I loved her confidence and ability to make things happen. 14 years later, she’s my wife, business/career partner and the mother to my 3 kids. It’s been a great time for me (less so for her, I’m sure) and I hope it lasts another 80 years.</p>
