          <p>Before the kids went <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/10/31/halloween-2/">trick-or-treating</a>, we went in the house to see the basement floor. It can be walked-on now, but will be curing for a couple weeks. After that, they’re going to lightly acid wash it to expose some of the aggregate.</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5124089981/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1128/5124089981_8e4e51417a.jpg" alt="New concrete in theater" /></a></p>

<p>After:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5136654776/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1393/5136654776_d7a61edb02.jpg" alt="Concrete is curing" /></a></p>

<p>This week they hooked the old boiler back up to get some heat in the house, so the radiators were on for the first time since we inspected it and the first time we’ve been in it while it was heated. It was nice and the radiators, as expected, are not too hot to touch.</p>

<p>The radiant heat in the basement floor isn’t yet hooked-up, but they said they’d connect it to the boiler and use the heat to help the concrete floor cure. So hopefully we can walk on it barefoot to test out how that feels.</p>

<p>We sent mail to the neighbors offering the wood from <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/10/27/monkey-puzzle-tree-removal/">the trees we cut down</a> and told Schuchart/Dow’s people they could take it too. I was surprised to find that all of it had been taken! We were going to post an ad on <a href="http://seattle.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a> for free firewood and let people haul it away for us, but we didn’t want to have a bunch of free-stuff-scavengers coming over at all hours of the day.</p>

          <p>We went to the house for the third time this week. This time we took the kids with us because today they were pouring the concrete in the basement and we wanted to put our handprints in the floor so the people renovating the house in 100 years find it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5124697042/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4147/5124697042_2af41623c2.jpg" alt="Handprints" /></a></p>

<p>When we got there, <a href="http://www.westlakeconcrete.com/">Westlake Concrete</a> was there and about halfway done with the floor. They were waiting on the second concrete truck to deliver more concrete. We got to see them pouring and leveling it. We had to wait for the concrete to set a little before we could put our handprints in it, so we went to Elysian for lunch. By the time we got back it was ready. Havana marched right into the basement and put footprints in the wet concrete before we could stop her. Mark, the superintendent, put some foam core down for me to walk on and Gay handed me the kids and I pushed their hands into the concrete. Gay put her hand in and then I put our name in using some alphabet letters we bought at a toy store on the way to the house.</p>

<p>Before we left, we had a phone call with Mark and the structural engineer, Eric, to talk about yet more beams he wants us to put in the attic. I feel like we’re making the house into a bomb shelter the way it’s being reinforced. The engineer insists it’s all necessary (and no one can argue because of liability concerns) but I can’t imagine every old house does as much as we’re doing to this roof. In the end, the entire roof will be rebuilt other than putting a new surface on it.</p>

          <p>We took the 9:00a ferry in to see the Monkey Puzzle trees being taken down. We got to the house about 10a and <a href="http://www.bartlett.com/locations/Kenmore-WA.cfm?a">Bartlett Tree Service</a> was about half-done limbing the first tree. By about 1pm the first tree was down to a stump and they were starting the other tree. We left at 2:30p and they thought they’d finish it, but by 5pm they hadn’t. It was limbed and topped, but a 40-foot trunk was still standing and needed to schedule a day to finish it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5121685715/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1133/5121685715_6f0bc2452d.jpg" alt="Limbing tree #1" /></a></p>

<p>We also met with another electrician and another plumber to bid on the project. And the people from <a href="http://www.pacgal.com/">Pacific Galleries</a> came to take some lighting fixtures that we’re going to sell at their auction in November.</p>

<p>The foreman for Bartlett Tree Service made a point of thanking us for hiring them. I assume it’s because of the state of the economy, most people are happy to even have a job these days, but you don’t hear it very often even now. He didn’t have to do it, of course – they do their job, we pay them, it’s a fair trade and we’re both satisfied – but it shows good character (and doesn’t take much). I’m more inclined to hire someone in the future who appreciates the work than someone who doesn’t. Some people we’ve hired over the years behave as if they’re owed a job and that we should be thankful that they’re willing to accept our money.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Today we had a lunch at the house for all the people involved in the house renovation. The architects, interior designers and contractors have worked separately with us as the conduit. Some people hadn’t even met yet. So we wanted to get everyone together at one time, talk and just have a friendly get-together. After a stop for another ultrasound and an OB/GYN appointment, Gay &amp; I picked up cupcakes (a favorite) at Cupcake Royale, beer and sodas at QFC and sandwiches at Volunteer Park Cafe and met everyone at the house.</p>

<p>People who were there: Nancy, My, Jim, Katie, Mark, Doug, Todd and us. Tom had to cancel because his mother had passed-away last week. Besides me, only Todd drank a beer during lunch. I can’t believe I can’t get construction workers to drink beer. This is the third time we’ve brought beer for them and the third time they’ve refused to drink it. Maybe we’ll try white wine spritzers next.</p>

<p>We talked mostly about the stuff the interior designers are working on and walked around the house to talk about some things that Schuchart/Dow is working on. Nancy and Jim agreed with me that the exposed wall in the basement is ugly. Nancy helped us pick out a concrete for the basement from all the samples they did, which was becoming a danger to keeping on schedule.</p>

<p>Eric, the structural engineer, came over later to talk about the stuff he thinks we need to do in the attic. We’d never met him and, except for a couple phone conversations, always talked to him through the architect. It was helpful to finally talk face-to-face with him. We discussed again how we can get rid of the cross-ties in the attic that I don’t like. There’s 2 options: 1) replace every cross-tie with either a steel cable or a steel rod or 2) build 3 trusses with steel beams joining them and put in a ridge beam. The 2nd option may (engineer-speak for “absolutely positively will”) require changes to the lower floors too. Schuchart/Dow will price those options, but I’m guessing we’ll continue with the current plan and keep the cross-ties.</p>

        <article>
          <p>We went to <a href="http://www.seattlesymphony.org/benaroya/">Benaroya Hall</a> to see <a href="http://www.belleandsebastian.com/home.php">Belle &amp; Sebastian</a> (name taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_and_Sebastian_(TV_series)">a cartoon</a>, not the names of people in the band). We ran into Peter Johnson and his cousin in the lobby, which was a surprise. He said that <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/05/15/reid-marissas-wedding/">Reid and Marissa</a> were also there. I should have expected that. We did see them across the hall once we got into the show and texted Reid to say “Hi”.</p>

<p>It was a good show, although our seats weren’t very good. They played a cross-section of their songs, but with so many albums and EPs they’ve made over the years – they used to be very prolific – a 90-minute show seems short. I’m surprised they didn’t play “Stars of Track and Field”. I like the newer albums but I miss the older songs with the trumpet and horns. I didn’t think to bring the better camera, but at least I took some videos with my iPhone.</p>

<p>I still remember the last time we saw the band. It was <a href="http://www.belleandsebastian.com/tour.php?view=event&amp;event=62">3 days after 9/11 at the Moore Theatre</a>. A bunch of us met down the street for dinner before the show and, of course, talked about 9/11. Belle &amp; Sebastian’s happy music was a nice distraction from it. The band is Scottish and the founder of the band (who shares a birthday with Hudson), wore an American flag shirt and expressed his sympathies. At the time, the world was united against terrorism for the first time in history. It’s amazing how less than a year after that the Bush Administration destroyed any goodwill the rest of the world had for us and squandered the opportunity to bring the world’s armies against terrorism by acting like stupid cowboys bent on re-fighting the Iraq war from 1991.</p>
