              <p>My iPad 2 finally arrived. I ordered it on the Monday after the Friday it was released, when<a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/03/11/ipad-2-day/"> I didn’t get one at the local store</a>. Almost 4 weeks later, it arrived. My SmartCover arrived a couple weeks ago.</p>

<p>It’s quite a bit faster than the older iPad and I really like how the SmartCover props it up for typing. But why doesn’t iTunes sync the app organization?!? It took me an hour to rearrange all my installed apps.</p>

              <p>I had to go to the house today to move the speakers I installed in the foyer. They had to be installed early because they’re installed into the drywall and the drywallers needed to tape and mud it over. But the interior designers picked some <a href="http://www.restorationhardware.com/catalog/product/product.jsp?productId=prod80525&amp;searchId=1301502757719">antelope</a> <a href="http://www.restorationhardware.com/catalog/product/product.jsp?productId=prod80521&amp;categoryId=">heads</a> we want to hang in the same place the speakers were installed, so the speakers need to be moved over to make it possible to mount the heads.</p>

<p>Gay, Eva and I took the 9:40a ferry and got to the house by 10:30a after a quick stop at Top Pot Doughnuts. Mark from Twisted Metalworks was there finishing the bracket installation in the attic, the tile guys finished the kitchen floor and were getting ready to do the bathroom walls, Kurt was busy with window and door trim, Colin was finishing up the blocking in the basement ceiling (which looks original!), and the cabinetry was being installed in the kitchen and butler’s pantry.</p>

<p>Colin and I worked on the foyer speakers, he did the south one and I did the north one, but we had to go before we finished, so I left it to Colin to finish.</p>

              <p>We went to Seattle today for some errands and for me to go install the gas springs on the garage trapdoor. Mark from Twisted Metalworks happened to be there installing the brackets in the attic for the moving wall that they’re going to build.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5579318427/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5180/5579318427_23e40536fc.jpg" alt="Attic wall bracket" /></a></p>

<p>They had made the brackets that were installed in the ceiling months ago. Now he had the rods that screw into those brackets and hold the lower brackets fastened to the cross-ties. These brackets will hold the track for the wall. Olson Kundig designed them and, on paper, weren’t that interesting to us, but now that we saw them we really like them. The brass washer is a nice touch, although we’re not sure it was intentional.</p>

<p>I helped out a little handing the rods up to Mark (from Twisted Metalworks, not Mark from SD) while he was standing above the cross-ties so he could screw them into the hidden brackets in the ceiling. While Gay left and ran her errands, I went to the garage to install the gas springs on the trapdoor. I had tried a couple weeks ago to install them but found out that the ones I bought were too short and weren’t strong enough to lift the door, which turned out to be heavier than I thought it was. I had ordered longer and stronger versions, including better brackets as the others were bending under the weight, and had them installed pretty quickly. It works pretty well too… after you lift the door about 16 inches the springs take over and lift the door the rest of the way all by themselves. No more feeling like you’re about to be pulled into the hole in the floor! It’s also much easier to close it, you can just push it from the other side a couple feet and it closes by itself, so you don’t have to reach across the opening or stand on the side and lower it.</p>

<p>A bunch of the cabinetry had been delivered this week and was being installed. All the cabinetry in the bathrooms, except for the master bathroom, had been installed and the installer was finishing up Eva’s cabinetry today.</p>

<p>All the wood for the trim around the house arrived while I was waiting for Gay to get back and the guys hauled that in. The kitchen tile had been started yesterday and was getting closer to completion today. That looks great. Things are moving fast now but we’re told everything will feel like it came to a screeching halt when painting starts, hopefully in a few weeks.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>We found out today that two big problems we’d been worrying about for weeks were solved.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5571725669/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5255/5571725669_0020b93ffa.jpg" alt="Master bath tile mock-up" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The master bath tile looked like it would be difficult to set on corners of the bathroom because of its unusual surface – it has a bevel on the top and bottom and the face is convex. At the corners where the wall ends, some of the tiles would be cut and, because of the surface, it would be hard to make it look right, especially on outside corners. The tile guy was very worried about it and built a little wall to do a mock-up and it didn’t look good. So for weeks we’ve been going round and round about it with the tile guys, the designers and the manufacturer trying to figure out how to make it work. It seemed that it was meant to only be used on one wall but we wanted to use it on all walls of the bathroom, which requires going around corners. Everyone seemed convinced that it wouldn’t work and we had to pick another tile. I kept at it because I loved this tile the second I saw it but even I was considering giving up. With the master bath finally prepped for tile, they did a mock-up on the wall and, lo and behold, it looks good!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5572314850/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5224/5572314850_a8a96fab7c.jpg" alt="Kitchen tile cleaned" /></a></p>

<p>The other problem was the kitchen tile. When it arrived, they unpacked it from the crates, laid some down and they saw ugly stripes of burnishing in them. They were packed with two lengths of padding between each stone. As they traveled from China by boat, the vibration of the boat caused the padding to rub and wore stripes into them, as if they were sanded. It took 5 weeks to get the tile here, so we couldn’t just order more because that would delay a lot of work that was waiting for the kitchen floor to be done. While Mark worked with the US retailer in San Francisco to see if they would either replace the tiles or pay to have it repaired and we tried to figure out if we could arrange in the kitchen so that the worst of it was not visible – not likely, it turned out that 120 of the 130 tiles were damaged. Another shortened long story, Mark tried cleaning it with a mild cleaner and the burnishing came right out and they look great!</p>
