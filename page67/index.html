        <article>
          <p>Googling for “<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=octane+fitness+err+3&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Octane Fitness Err 3</a>” doesn’t provide much help, so I’m writing this to get it into Google to provide more info…</p>

<p>We bought an <a href="http://www2.octanefitness.com/">Octane Fitness</a> elliptical machine almost 4 years ago. It’s a great machine and we love it. A year ago it started showing “Err 3” on the display after being used when the Cool Down program finished. We could still use it, we just had to hit the Clear button and it was fine. I couldn’t find much of anything about this online so we called the dealer where we bought it. They concluded that it needed a new right stride motor – the motor that adjusts the length of the running stride. Octane shipped them a new one for free and we paid the $125 or so for their repair man to come over and install it. That fixed it for a while. It started doing it again a few months later so Octane thought it was one of the logic boards that was failing. They shipped them a new one of those and we paid the $125 or so for the guy to install that.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>It worked fine for several months until about 4 weeks ago, when it got much worse. It used to go to “Err 3” only after  a run, but this time it would do it after running just 1/4 mile or so. I could reset it and keep running but it would continue every few minutes or even less. This made using the machine impossible. I called Octane Fitness myself this time and talked to a very helpful tech support guy. It almost always showed Err 3 but this time it was also showing Err 2 some times. Because of this, he thought it was the logic board again so he sent me one for free and said I could install it myself and save the $125. I got it a week later and he was right, it was easy to install. But it didn’t fix it. There was no improvement at all.</p>

<p>I called Octane Fitness again, talked to the same guy and he went through some tests on the machine with me over the phone and concluded that the right stride motor was again the problem. He sent me a new stride motor for free and, again, shipped it directly to me and said I could install it myself. At this point, I hadn’t used it for over a week and wanted to get the part quicker. I explained that I appreciated him sending me the part for free, but I offered to pay for overnight or 2nd Day shipping to get it sooner. He refused to take my money and shipped it 2nd Day. I got the part, installed it, which was not as easy as the logic board, but it did fix the problem.</p>

<p>I learned that Err 3 means the right stride motor is failing and Err 2 means the left stride motor is failing. Err 3 is much more common because it always checks the right motor first and only checks the left if the right passed the test. The logic board runs tests on it frequently and any error at all causes it to show the error code. It’d be nice if there was a way to bypass the error-check and continue to use the machine, just without the ability to adjust the stride. I still don’t know what the problem was because I was seeing both Err 3 and Err 2. Either the left stride motor is about to fail too or the logic board <em>and</em> the right stride motor were faulty and both needed to be replaced.</p>

<p>It’s annoying that the stride motors on the machine are so apt to break, but I am very happy with Octane Fitness’ tech support and customer service for sending me parts for free every time and not even charging me for shipping! And the tech support guy (Eric?) was very polite, friendly and patient. Several weeks ago I was very upset with the machine and was expecting to have to buy a whole new machine and from a competitor (who probably has other problems with their machines). But today, I wouldn’t hesitate to buy another Octane Fitness machine. In fact, the new models look so nice I’m considering getting a new one anyway.</p>

          <p>As of today, I’ve made 41 trips around the sun. I hope I get a lot more. Gay made me birthday dinner, as usual, and got a ton of nice beers for me to pick from while she cooked. Knowing I’d have wine with dinner, I took it easy and had Sierra Nevada’s 2010 Celebration Ale, one of my favorite winter beers.</p>

<p>Summary of my 41st year:</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Just a few days before my 40th last year, my dad had a sudden visit to the hospital and they found he had cancer in his kidney. <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/11/22/my-dad-is-cancer-free/">He had it removed</a> and is cancer-free.</p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/12/06/seattle-to-cabo/">We went to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico</a> for a winter vacation.</p>

<p>We were working with Tom Kundig on designing a new house on Vashon and were getting cold feet about staying on Vashon, so we took three trips, in <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/01/15/san-francisco-2/">January</a>, February (with Havana) and in March with both kids via <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/03/21/tahoe/">Tahoe</a>, to San Francisco to see about real estate there.</p>

<p>Havana had <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/03/25/havanas-first-ski-lesson/">her first ski lesson</a> while in Tahoe.</p>

<p>Hudson had his first (and hopefully last) <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/03/11/hudsons-first-stitches/">stitches</a> after mysteriously falling on something (we still don’t know).</p>

<p>We celebrated <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/04/30/happy-birthday-havana-3/">Havana’s 3rd birthday</a>.</p>

<p>We decided to not build the house on Vashon and <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/06/01/moving-back-to-seattle/">to buy a house in Seattle</a> instead. We finally <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/06/16/bought-a-house-in-seattle/">bought a house in Seattle</a> in June and closed on it July 19. It’s been under renovation ever since.</p>

<p>Gay and I celebrated <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/07/31/6th-wedding-anniversary/">our 6th wedding anniversary</a>.</p>

<p>Hudson <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/08/25/happy-birthday-hudson-2/">turned 2</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/08/04/baby-3-20-week-ultrasound/">Baby #3</a> was conceived and is mostly done.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Trick-or-treating is not very good on Vashon, so we took the kids to the new house for their first Halloween. Seattle is supposed to be <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/10/27/pf/best_trick_or_treat_halloween/index.htm">the best city in the country for trick-or-treating</a>, lucky kids. Havana was a mermaid and Hudson was a shark. We drove around Capitol Hill to see all the decorated houses. Havana pointed out every house with jack-o-lanterns out: “Pumpkins!”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5136661062/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1065/5136661062_c742572a5e.jpg" alt="1st Halloween" /></a></p>

<p>We’d been hearing about 18th and 19th Avenues, which really put on a show. The streets were blocked-off to cars, but the streets were filling up even before dark and the houses we could see were elaborately decorated. It wasn’t advisable to bring young kids to those streets because it was <em>too</em> scary, so we stayed on our street. Most of the houses on our street were decorated but it was more low-key.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Hudson was tired by the time we got to the end of our street and, to make matters worse, he was frightened by one house with scary music playing and a moving ghost. We made it down the other side of the street before they were both ready to quit. It took a few houses before they got the hang of trick-or-treating.</p>

<p>We talked to several of the neighbors, most that we’d already met, but we met a few more. We also learned that the house two doors down from us that was recently sold was bought by a couple with a 3 year-old. Another couple has twins (dressed up as Thing 1 and Thing 2) that are about 2 years old, I think, so there will be other kids Havana and Hudson’s ages.</p>

<p>We left just after 7pm, picked up pizza on the way home and got on the 7:40p ferry back to put the kids to bed and watch the Steelers/Saints game.</p>

          <p>Before the kids went <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/10/31/halloween-2/">trick-or-treating</a>, we went in the house to see the basement floor. It can be walked-on now, but will be curing for a couple weeks. After that, they’re going to lightly acid wash it to expose some of the aggregate.</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5124089981/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1128/5124089981_8e4e51417a.jpg" alt="New concrete in theater" /></a></p>

<p>After:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5136654776/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1393/5136654776_d7a61edb02.jpg" alt="Concrete is curing" /></a></p>

<p>This week they hooked the old boiler back up to get some heat in the house, so the radiators were on for the first time since we inspected it and the first time we’ve been in it while it was heated. It was nice and the radiators, as expected, are not too hot to touch.</p>

<p>The radiant heat in the basement floor isn’t yet hooked-up, but they said they’d connect it to the boiler and use the heat to help the concrete floor cure. So hopefully we can walk on it barefoot to test out how that feels.</p>

<p>We sent mail to the neighbors offering the wood from <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/10/27/monkey-puzzle-tree-removal/">the trees we cut down</a> and told Schuchart/Dow’s people they could take it too. I was surprised to find that all of it had been taken! We were going to post an ad on <a href="http://seattle.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a> for free firewood and let people haul it away for us, but we didn’t want to have a bunch of free-stuff-scavengers coming over at all hours of the day.</p>

          <p>We went to the house for the third time this week. This time we took the kids with us because today they were pouring the concrete in the basement and we wanted to put our handprints in the floor so the people renovating the house in 100 years find it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5124697042/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4147/5124697042_2af41623c2.jpg" alt="Handprints" /></a></p>

<p>When we got there, <a href="http://www.westlakeconcrete.com/">Westlake Concrete</a> was there and about halfway done with the floor. They were waiting on the second concrete truck to deliver more concrete. We got to see them pouring and leveling it. We had to wait for the concrete to set a little before we could put our handprints in it, so we went to Elysian for lunch. By the time we got back it was ready. Havana marched right into the basement and put footprints in the wet concrete before we could stop her. Mark, the superintendent, put some foam core down for me to walk on and Gay handed me the kids and I pushed their hands into the concrete. Gay put her hand in and then I put our name in using some alphabet letters we bought at a toy store on the way to the house.</p>

<p>Before we left, we had a phone call with Mark and the structural engineer, Eric, to talk about yet more beams he wants us to put in the attic. I feel like we’re making the house into a bomb shelter the way it’s being reinforced. The engineer insists it’s all necessary (and no one can argue because of liability concerns) but I can’t imagine every old house does as much as we’re doing to this roof. In the end, the entire roof will be rebuilt other than putting a new surface on it.</p>
