              <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2337.jpg" alt="IMG_2343.jpg" />Steve came over on Friday to help us out with colors for the office (and the rest of the house!). We still like the green (after a whole week!) so we’re sticking with that. We, or Gay &amp; Steve actually, chose a purplish/brown color called “Wild Raisin” for the window wall. The trim will be white and Steve liked our choice of carpet. We’re still figuring out the ceiling color, which can’t be white because the trim will be white.</p>

<p>We finished the second coat of green on the three walls and Gay put a coat of the Wild Raisin on the window wall. The green, by the way, is named “Olive Range”. Why are paint color names so food-oriented?</p>

              <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2334.jpg" alt="IMG_2334.jpg" />We painted one wall in a green that we like. We’re still not sure about what to do with the red wall. I want to paint it a darker red and Gay wants to paint the whole room the green color. Hopefully red and green won’t look like Christmas colors if we go darker red. And we’re not sure what to do about the trim; I’m leaning towards keeping it all one color.</p>

<p>Here’s the carpet we’re thinking…

              <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2328.jpg" alt="IMG_2328.jpg" />We put one coat of the red on the window wall. We’re not sure we like it though, it’s a little too pink for our tastes. But we do like the red wall as it has a nice contrast with the view outside the windows which highlights the windows. We’re still trying to decide on a color for the other walls.</p>

<p>We also discovered another problem with the construction work: the trim was mounted too low. On the other wall where the trim was not removed, it’s a half-inch above the floor so that flooring can be installed underneath the trim. But the reinstalled trim is mounted flush with the floor. So we think the trim has to be redone for the second time. And because of the outlets, the existing trim can’t be reused.</p>

<p>(I need to clean the lens on the camera!)</p>

              <p>It was a great game (because they won) but they almost blew it by penalties – although a couple were bad calls by the ref, the Steelers looked stupid and sloppy.  Nevertheless, they won 17-16 by a last minute field goal and are now 11-1 for the season. Unfortunately, the Steelers are looking worse heading into the playoffs while New England and the Eagles are both getting better.</p>

              <p>I never posted about our second Thanksgiving dinner we had the Saturday after <a href="http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2953">Thanksgiving</a>. Gay cooked all day Friday and Saturday. Eric, Steve, Steve (“Biff”) and Renuka and baby Owen, Mark, Lee and Mark’s parents, visiting from Minnesota, came over. Steve made sweet potatoes and Mark brought Pumpkin Pie. Biff made the mashed potatoes. And I took pictures, but only of food.
