            <p>The kids dressed as Harry Potter characters. Hudson was Harry Potter, Havana was Hermione and Eva was Crookshanks, Hermione’s cat. The kids with Gerene and Cheryl:</p>

<p>This was the first year they all went up to the doors by themselves, we could stay on the sidewalk. They were all excited about sorting their candy and, of course, eating it and that lasted through the next morning too. After that, they forgot about the candy, just like previous years.</p>

            <p>We went to the parent-teacher conferences for Havana and Hudson. Both are doing great.</p>

<p>Hudson’s story:</p>

<p>Havana’s favorite feature about herself, her eye lashes:</p>

<p><img src="/img/IMG_5027.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Havana wrote a story about her first cross-country meet:</p>

<p><img src="/img/IMG_5030.jpg" alt="" />
<img src="/img/IMG_5028.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Interestingly, she thinks she used to live in Washington, DC. I think she gets confused between Washington, DC and Washington State and/or she thinks that because I grew up there she thinks she did too.</p>

<p>What Havana thinks of school:</p>

          </h3>
            <p>As we were putting the kids to bed during a wind storm tonight, the power went out. All 3 were unnerved by it. This was a common Fall and Winter occurrence when we lived on Vashon Island but the kids were too young to remember those outages. It’s rare in the city so this was new to them. The power company predicted we’d be without power until noon tomorrow. The kids didn’t like that!</p>

<p>Havana did not want to go to sleep with the power out, even though her room was always dark at night (but maybe slightly less dark).</p>

<p>Hudson wanted to know how long it would take to have it fixed and didn’t understand why it would take so long.</p>

<p>Eva didn’t understand at all that electricity even existed and had a difficult time understanding that the lights just don’t work.</p>

<p>Havana and Eva ended up sleeping together in Havana’s bed.</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of electricity and I find it frustrating that in a modern city in a modern country that we have power outages when the wind blows. But I enjoyed this one. Gay and I had a quiet night reading by candlelight. The power came back at 10:30pm, I caught the last 5 minutes of the Huskies game.</p>

            <p>Havana’s 2nd grade class ran the (K-5, a.k.a. Lower School’s) Monday Morning Meeting this week, which is a big deal. They did a presentation on composting (only in Seattle!) and Havana gave the finalé, thanking everyone for coming, ushering the 5th graders out and reminding everyone to compost.
