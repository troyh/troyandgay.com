          <a class="post-link" href="/2004/10/09/debate-3.html">Debate #3</a>
        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>I thought this debate was far more lopsided in Kerry’s favor than the first presidential debate, but the polls so far show it much closer. Did anyone see Kerry’s complete command of the facts and figures while Bush continued to just make platitudes?! Maybe I’m biased after Bush referred to web sites as “the internets”. ;)</p>

<p>One thing that struck me was when Bush said “I was not happy when they didn’t find any [WMDs]”. Why was he unhappy? If he was so concerned that Iraq was putting WMDs into the hands of the terrorists they harbored, wouldn’t he be ecstatic that his fears were unwarranted? For someone who claims to be protecting our country, I am terrified that he <em>wanted</em> WMDs to be found.</p>

<p>And when Bush said “I’m a good steward of the environment”…. WOW…. did <em>anyone</em> fall for that?!</p>

<p>Bush said he would only pick a Supreme Court judge who interprets the Constitution and then went on to say that he wouldn’t pick a judge who would remove “Under God” from the pledge of allegiance. Hey Bush, that ruling was made from a strict interpretation of the Constitution, you know, the whole “separation of church and state” that is pretty central to the Constitution. And citing the Dred Scott case as an example of what he doesn’t want our Supreme Court to do? Good to know that Bush doesn’t support slavery. I’m with him there. But was he trying to imply that Kerry is for slavery?</p>

<p>When asked specifically for three examples of mistakes he made, Bush couldn’t name a single one. Crikey.</p>

<p>And Kerry, when Bush criticized the UN for not being able to get Hussein out of power, said:</p>

<p><em>The goal of the sanctions was not to remove Saddam Hussein, it was to remove the weapons of mass destruction. And, Mr. President, just yesterday the Duelfer report told you and the whole world they worked. He didn’t have weapons of mass destruction, Mr. President. That was the objective. And if we’d used smart diplomacy, we could have saved $200 billion and an invasion of Iraq. And right now, Osama bin Laden might be in jail or dead. That’s the war against terror.</em></p>

<p>In other words, if we were smart, we’d be $200 billion richer, Iraq would still be powerless and bin Laden wouldn’t still be bombing hotels in Egypt. But, of course, Bush still won’t say what he wants to say: that kicking Saddam out of power <em>was</em> his objective.</p>

          <p>This is what our cook calls me – I love it.  Troy is just “Mr.” luckily; he has a hard enough time being called “Mr. Jillmore” because I made many of the hotel reservations.</p>

<p>Speaking of names, in Bali (we haven’t determined yet whether this is true for all of Indonesia), there are only 4:  the first child (boy or girl) is named Wayan; the second, Made; the third, Ngyoman; and the fourth, Ketut.  After that, they start over again.  There is some word for “the second”, as in “Wayan, the second” but we didn’t catch exactly what it is.  I would think this would be highly confusing.  Our housekeeper (female) is “Wayan”, as is our driver (male).  We regularly pass dozens of “Made’s Warungs (shops)” and “Wayan’s Cafes”.  I would imagine the family name would be more prominent, but we have yet to hear anyone use it.</p>

<p>We have learned very little of the Indonesian Bahasa language (which is spoken more than the native Balinese or other local dialects now), but we say “Thank you” a lot, which is funny because their version is 5 syllables so you begin to feel like a doof saying it so much.  One thing we are struggling to learn are the various “Good day”s.  You say “Selamat pagi” (good morning) until 11am, then “Selamat siang” (good day) from 11am til 3pm, then “Selamat sore” (good afternoon) from 3pm until 7pm, and then “Selamat malam” (good evening) after that.  Not only do they observe more “sections” of the day than we do, they are slightly different.</p>

<p>One linguistic convention I think is clever, yet presents more difficulty to us, is the two forms of goodbye.  If you are leaving you say “Selamat tinggal”, but the person who is being left says “Selamat jalan” (note the similarity to the various good days).</p>

<p>Funniest Bahasa so far: the word for water is “air”.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2004/10/07/buying-alcohol-in-bali.html">Buying alcohol in Bali</a>
        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Speaking of buying alcohol, it’s strange here. When you go to a grocery store, the alcohol (excluding beer) is in a separate section. In the grocery store in Ubud, it looks like how you’d see jewelry being sold in the US – it’s in a glass case with a clerk standing behind it. Except in this case, there’s four clerks squeezed behind a counter about 6 feet long.</p>

<p>You tell them what you want and one of the clerks starts filling out the paperwork while another opens the case and gets the bottles you ordered. The paperwork takes a while, so the other three clerks tend to just stand there. This is something you see in socialist countries – restaurants routinely have more staff than customers, for example.</p>

<p>Once the paperwork is filled out, you get a copy and you take that to the cashier. The cashier then leaves the register and goes back to the alcohol counter to get your order. By this time, the two bottles of wine had a rubber band around them with another copy of the paperwork attached to them.</p>

<p>At the other place we bought alcohol (the <a href="http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2846">Walmart-like place</a>), the process was similar. But we could actually walk into the section and pick up the bottles we wanted. As we left, a woman standing there stops us, takes the bottles, fills out the paperwork, gives you a copy and you are allowed to take the bottles to the cashier yourself. Another difference was that the alcohol section only had the good wine and other alcohol. Cheaper wine and beer was available in a totally different location in the store.</p>

          <p>Instead of going to Denpasar, we opted for Gianyar instead (it’s closer). We wanted to get Baba Guling (suckling pig) and Gianyar is “famous” for it. We got there and found that the fame is apparently earned by just two places. We walked to one but it looked less than sanitary, so we kept walking and found the second place. It also looked unsanitary, but we ate there anyway.</p>

<p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_1846.jpg" alt="IMG_1846.jpg" /></p>

<p>We got a bowl of rice with chopped green beans and the typical Balinese sauce (garlic, turmeric, onions, etc.) and a few pieces of pork on top, some including skin, and a piece of pig intestine stuffed with something (eggs?). And on the side were two skewers of what appeared to be barbecued organs of the pig.</p>

<p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_1843.jpg" alt="IMG_1843.jpg" /></p>

<p>I ate everything except the skewers and the intestine. Gay ate considerably less. Total cost with one 650ml Bintang: ~$4.</p>

<p>Outside the place was a girl making several types of pork satays. We got a few of those (~50¢) and ate them right there. A German couple was standing outside and before entering turned around to us and asked “Is good?” and we politely nodded so they went in. I hope they think we were Australians. ;)</p>

<p>We walked down the street and got some ice cream (it’s hot here!) and then went back to the car. We drove around for 20 minutes or so looking for the post office to mail some postcards. Our driver did not know his way around Gianyar so had to stop and ask directions a few times. Eventually, we found it and sent 10 postcards home.</p>

<p>We then drove on to a tiny beach town/tourist trap. We thought we could go sit on the beach, have a beer and just watch the waves and people. The (black sand) beach was empty except for a string of tables of people selling drinks and candy. We got two beers, sat down on a bench and were immediately swarmed on by four people trying to sell us crap. No amount of “Tidak”s (“No”s) worked, so we had to sit there and drink our beers with people constantly showing us things we could buy. We quickly drank our beers and went back to the car and rode silently home to our villa.</p>

<p>This is the point I remember from Cuba where the poverty and the begging start to get to me. It’s one thing to be reminded of how relatively affluent you are as an American, but another to feel guilty for it. Part of me wants to give them money, part of me wants to tell them to fix their government. The Dutch control of Indonesia for 300 years brought wealth and prosperity to an almost-bankrupt Netherlands through selling spices, gold, oil, wood, etc. Japan kicked the Dutch out in WWII and Indonesia ran itself with a corrupt and ineffective government since. Now it’s time for Indonesia’s newly-democratic government to get capitalist and bring wealth to their people the same way the Dutch used the country’s resources to bring wealth to Europe.</p>

<p>Back at our villa, we sat down with a glass of whiskey and talked about the day while listening to more chainsaws chopping down trees below us. The staff chef was preparing our dinner. During our stay at our villa, the travel agency provides a staff of <em>three</em> people to be here all day. One cooks, one cleans and the other helps both. Ideally, we’d have total privacy, and we’ve been progressively having them do less so they can  go home and leave us here alone. But when our chef asks what we would like for breakfast or lunch or dinner the next day and we say we don’t want anything, he looks so dejected. We’ve been trying to understand why this is, but his English and our Indonesian are not very good so we haven’t been successful, until last night.</p>

<p>We correctly assumed that they all get paid whether they work or not, which made us feel better in sending them home. But we also learned that they are paid ~$50/month. To put that in perspective, we gave them $50 when we arrived to buy groceries while we were here. That made six (!) meals, with some change to spare. Imagine if your monthly salary was the equivalent of six home-cooked meals. The bottle of Jack Daniels we were drinking cost half their monthly wage. Obviously, they are not eating as well as we are at their home. We can’t even figure out how they can go out to a restaurant for lunch. Yesterday’s very cheap $4 lunch would be 8% of his monthly salary! That’s the equivalent of the average American earning $32,000/year having a $213 lunch!</p>

          <p>We lounged at the villa all day yesterday and then walked down the street (by “street” I mean the main highway through Bali) in Sayan, before stopping at a restaurant for dinner. During dinner it rained really hard, and not a Seattle-style rain, but an east coast rain. Came home, went to bed and was woken up by another hard rain.</p>

<p>Today, we’re planning to go to Denpasar to see “the big city” and then drive through Nusa Dua.</p>

<p>For the last couple days, we’ve listened to chainsaws and falling trees. They’re cutting down seemingly-healthy coconut trees in the river gorge below the villa. Indonesia has the second largest rain forest in the world, but over the last couple decades, it’s been shrinking faster than even Brazil’s. I guess they need to make furniture and wood carvings (naked women sometimes in lesbian embraces, penis bottle openers, etc.) more than they need forests.</p>

<p>One thing you can’t help but notice in Bali is these little palm leaf boxes filled with food, flowers, leaves that are placed everywhere, though mostly in doorways. They also burn a stick of incense by them. Every single day, people put these out as an offering to the demons (both good and bad demons). The offerings to the good demons are placed in decorative boxes positioned in prominent places.
<img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_1838.jpg" alt="IMG_1838.jpg" /></p>

<p>The offerings to the bad demons are on the ground, in less prominent locations.
<img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_1840.jpg" alt="IMG_1840.jpg" /></p>

<p>From reading the travel books, they do this to show respect to the good demons but place the offerings to the bad demons in “non-chalant” ways to appease them, but to act as if they were mistakes, I assume so as not to anger the good demons.</p>

<p>The result is that you see birds and dogs eating the food in them and they’re just strewn around the streets since they’re never picked up. What I wonder about is not the incredible loss of productivity in Bali from everyone doing this once or twice a day, but who makes all these little palm leaf boxes? That’s the business to be in! :)</p>
