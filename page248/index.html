            <p>The carpet and the vinyl flooring has been pulled up, the drywall and insulation was removed from the exterior wall, the roof was supported with a brace and today the holes for the windows were cut. The spaces for the windows are surprisingly big, it was shocking to walk into the room for the first time.</p>

<p>From the outside:

<p>Tomorrow the windows should go in and the electrician is coming on Monday to do all the electrical work. We still need to pick out the flooring. Right now, we’re planning to go with a dark brown bamboo flooring. Bamboo is extremely durable and eco-friendly since bamboo is essentially a weed, so there’s no shortage of it.</p>

<p>According to this graphic, which colors the state in shades of blue and red based on the percentage of Democrat and Republican votes in each state, shows that the US is less red than the electoral map indicates. That’s encouraging, in fact, the country appears to be very moderate to left-leaning. Very interesting. “This graphic”:http://s-train.kaphmedia.net/archives/blog-misc/2004countymap2.gif, which shows the breakdown at the precinct-level, i.e., all-or-nothing counting the way the electoral college works.</p>

            <p>Bush’s “acceptance speech”:http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/11/20041103-3.html: <em>Reaching these goals will require the broad support of Americans. So today I want to speak to every person who voted for my opponent: To make this nation stronger and better I will need your support, and I will work to earn it. I will do all I can do to deserve your trust. A new term is a new opportunity to reach out to the whole nation. We have one country, one Constitution and one future that binds us. And when we come together and work together, there is no limit to the greatness of America.</em></p>

<p>I hope he’s as successful in uniting the country as he was in dividing it.</p>
