          <p>They’re <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002064801_oilspill16m.html">close to catching</a> the people who spilled the oil all over south Puget Sound and Vashon. One of the two suspects “has a history of pollution incidents”. A few lawsuits will make the corporation be more careful next time.</p>

          <p>We made it to Taipei! We watched a movie called <a href="http://www.thenotebookmovie.com/">The Notebook</a> on the plane. Never heard of it, but Gay cried like a baby. After a 2-hour layover we’re off to San Francisco for an 11-hour flight. Hopefully we’ll make our connecting flight to Seattle, catch the 11:30pm ferry to Vashon and be at home by midnight. :)</p>

          <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2130.jpg" alt="IMG_2130.jpg" />We went to the shipping place and arranged for our shipment. Then came back to the hotel for our massage and facial. I’ve never had a massage before and certainly not a facial and I was apprehensive about it, but it was fun.</p>

<p>We had our private dinner on the beach. It was very windy, but the wind kept the mosquitos and humidity away. The dinner was a four-course meal: prawns sembala, papaya soup, duck with rice and vegetables and dessert was a fruit plate with black rice pudding. Everything was very very good. And we had a good bottle of wine too.</p>

<p>We were very full and it was late when we came back to our room at 9pm. We fell asleep on the lounge chairs by the pool.</p>

<p>I realized we hadn’t posted photos of our hotel room, so here’s a few random ones of the area outside the room starting with the entrance to the villa/room. The “room” is surrounded by a 7-foot wall so we had plenty of privacy and living area.</p>

          <p>Watching CNN in Indonesia… one of the most important things they talk about is the price of oil. It’s barely a news story in the US, but CNN Asia &amp; CNN Europe can’t get enough of it. I’ve never heard the terms “Sweet and sour” or “Light” referring to oil – they talk about the different types of oil all the time, and I’m not sure why.</p>

<p>The other big story here is the US elections…. just goes to show that the US is <em>not</em> an island and what happens in the US does affect the rest of the world.</p>

          <p>Today’s the last day of our honeymoon. We’re going to see about shipping stuff home, have a massage (my first ever!) and then have a “romantic dinner for two” (hotel’s words) on the beach tonight for the last dinner of our vacation. Then all day traveling tomorrow and, hopefully, be back at home late Saturday night. :)</p>
