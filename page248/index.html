          <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2068.jpg" alt="IMG_2068.jpg" />We went out walking around Seminyak. Pictured is a temple near our hotel. This time I wore a cotton t-shirt and it made all the difference… 3 hours walking in the hot, humid weather and I was much better. It’s best to listen to Gay when she says “Are you really going to wear that thick linen shirt?”. ;)

We did some shopping and stopped at a swanky bar/club for a light lunch (satays and spring rolls) and beers. The picture shows the view from our table overlooking the “lawn” and pool. Then more and more and more shopping, walking around half the town of Seminyak.</p>

<p>We stopped and had dinner at the highly-recommended Mykonos, very good Greek food for Bali. Then back to the hotel for some wine by the pool. :)

One thing I have to point out is the state of sidewalks in Bali. The pictured sidewalk is very common here and makes walking around town difficult (which I doubt the taxi drivers mind). If you look into the hole in the sidewalk, you’ll see running water. I don’t know if it’s there irrigation system for the rice paddies or what, but I have seen people dipping buckets into the water (I hope not to cook with!). But at least there are sidewalks… some streets have no sidewalk or even a shoulder, which makes walking less fun.</p>

          <p>I think we just had an earthquake here in Bali.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: It’s <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/SP276054.htm">confirmed</a>, a 5.0 quake hit right near us off the coast. We talked with a couple locals about it and they did feel it too but thought nothing of it since minor quakes hit Bali often. And living in Seattle, quakes are fairly uneventful unless they hit 6.0 (10x more powerful than a 5.0) or more.</p>

          <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2065.jpg" alt="IMG_2065.jpg" />We spent most of the day at our hotel sunbathing and reading. It’s so humid here that you can only sit outside, even in the shade, for 30 minutes before you have to get in the pool to cool off. So that’s what we did all morning and afternoon: alternate between the chaise lounge and the pool. This was the most relaxing day we’ve had for over a week. And Gay’s even learning to swim!</p>

<p>In the afternoon, we decided to go for a walk on the beach. But I made the mistake of wearing a long-sleeve and heavy linen shirt. It was fine on the breezy beach, but when we walked into the town of Legian, the lack of a breeze and shade was too much and the hour-long walk through town ended in me being drenched in sweat. So we returned to the hotel to get back in the pool.</p>

<p>For dinner, we went to the hotel’s restaurant and to see the Indonesian dancing on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The buffet-style dinner was nice (barbecued beef, lamb and chorizo; salads; soup; lots of desserts). And the hotel has spotlights on the surf so you could see the white of the waves breaking even after sunset, which is a nice effect that I’ve never seen a beach hotel do.</p>

<p>By this time, it was <em>way</em> past our bedtime (9:30!), so we came back tired and went to bed.</p>

          <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2024.jpg" alt="IMG_2024.jpg" /><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2027.jpg" alt="IMG_2027.jpg" />For dinner, we went next door to a highly-recommended restaurant, <a href="http://kudeta.net/">Ku De Ta</a>. This place is a hotel without the rooms. It’s an extremely trendy place with extremely trendy customers. It sits right on the beach and has sunbathers and people lounging around on the seats. In fact, it’s not possible to not lounge on the seats, they’re just benches with thick cushions on them. I imagine the concept for the place is to attract people who are staying at low-end hotels or hotels not on the beach so they created a place where you can hang out all day and be served drinks. The exciting thing is that they have <a href="http://makersmark.com">Maker’s Mark</a>; this is the first time we’ve seen it here so we had to have a manhattan. We had a couple drinks and watched the surfers and the sunset before moving to the dining area for dinner. If you look closely, you can see surfers out in the water.</p>

<p>Dinner was excellent. I had braised lamb neck and Gay had the saffron seafood risotto. For the first time in Bali, I felt like I was not in Bali – the only Indonesians were the staff.</p>

<p>After dinner, we came back to the hotel and swam in the (heated?) pool and then to bed. We’ve been getting up at about 6:30am every day so by 9pm, we’re ready for bed, and in an air-conditioned room. I’m going to try to get on a similar schedule at home, although 9pm is still too early for me to go to bed.</p>
