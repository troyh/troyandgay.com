          <p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,59381,00.html">Jonathan Ive on the design</a> of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/powermac/">new PowerMac G5</a>. I’m amazed by Apple’s designs. In an industry that believes technical design is all that matters, it’s fun to have a company like Apple that pays so much attention to things that matter to humans. Apple makes you want the things they make. The rest of the industry makes you pay for things begrudgingly.</p>

          <p>Boy, I can relate to <a href="http://www.theonion.com/onion3924/area_man_constantly.html">this</a>. I can’t even begin to count the number of people who’ve made it clear to me that they don’t own a TV in the last year or so. And a sure-fire way to get people to make this claim is to tell them how great TiVo is. I’m the last person to like TV, but geez, 90% of TV being lousy is not a reason to not own a TV. 90% of books are lousy too, but you’ll never hear these enlightened intellectuals say “I don’t own any printed dead trees”.</p>

          <p>We saw <a href="http://www.realwomenhavecurves.com/">Real Women Have Curves</a>, a movie about an intelligent not-skinny Mexican teenage girl living in Los Angeles whose own mother repeatedly disparages her weight thinking it will prevent her from getting married. It’s cute and simple and short, but it’s undeveloped and unsurprising. It’s more about a modern girl’s ambitions versus her mother’s older generation expectations for females.</p>

          <p><a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2084727/">Slate on Linux surpassing Macs as the #2 desktop OS</a>. He’s right, Linux will surpass the Mac, if it hasn’t already. But Apple doesn’t need to worry, Microsoft does. Few people are trying to decide between a Mac and Linux – they’re deciding between Linux and Windows. The appeal of the Mac is great design and usability, something nobody will beat Apple at anytime soon. Certainly not Linux. Not even the wealthy Microsoft has been able to match Apple on that turf. But Windows is not well-designed, so it’s clearly susceptible to Linux’s similarly-poorly-designed GUI.</p>
