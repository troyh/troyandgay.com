        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>We met the home inspectors at the house at noon. Jim Dow and Doug, from <a href="http://www.schuchartdow.com/">Shuchart/Dow</a>, and <a href="http://www.nbdesigngroup.net/">Nancy Burfiend</a>, the interior decorator who helped us with our current house, and a couple of her colleagues came over too. By 6pm we were all done. Two hours is my normal meeting limit so I was tired of talking.</p>

<p>Gay and I stopped at <a href="http://www.smithseattle.com/">Smith</a>, a restaurant in our new neighborhood, for dinner and to relax before driving back to Vashon. Kelly had taken the kids to the museum and zoo in Tacoma, so they also had a long day but we got to see them before they went to bed.</p>

<p>We had a lot of information to process, so neither of us could sleep. We tried, but we didn’t get to sleep until after 2am.</p>

<p>The inspection went better than we thought. We were expecting major problems, like the entire exterior surface of the house had to be taken off and replaced, but that doesn’t appear to be the case. That’s good. The written report should tell us more. And next week we’ll have the contractor’s sub-contractors take a look.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>18 months ago we decided to stay put on Vashon and build a new house to replace our house that is one bedroom too small and that we generally don’t like. We hired an architect, fired that architect and then hired a much better architect. We got throughout schematic design and had a great design. But we were increasingly weary of committing to raising the kids on Vashon for the next 20 years. The crazy Vashon people and their fear of progress, the lousy elementary and middle schools, the low percentage (50%) of high school kids going to college and the lack of diversity make for a place where I’d regret raising the kids. I went to high school where education and learning were not respected and very few of my friends went to college. I could do better than that for my kids.</p>

<p>We started house-hunting in the San Francisco area. We figured if there was a good time to buy in San Francisco, the Great American Housing Crisis was it. We took 3 trips down there but couldn’t find anything we liked or could afford in or out of the city. Then we started house-hunting in Seattle, which seemed cheap in comparison to San Francisco.

We narrowed in on Capitol Hill and Washington Park neighborhoods quickly just based on access to good public schools, walkability to restaurants and parks and larger yards. We made an offer on a house in Capitol Hill but couldn’t agree on price and we lost a poorly-handled bidding-war on a second house in Washington Park.</p>

<p>We weren’t using a real estate agent thinking we could do it ourselves (with the internet) and thinking we could pay less for the house by saving the seller the 3% broker commission. In both cases, we think it hurt us not having an agent – other agents just don’t feel comfortable talking directly with buyers. Or maybe they fear their obsolescence and resist?</p>

<p>We decided to enlist a real estate agent and picked one of Seattle’s best, Bob Bennion. Bob proves that there is such a thing as a valuable agent. He has decades of experience and is well-connected. We found a house in Capitol Hill that needed lots of work but has tons of potential. Bob advised us not to buy it. We brought our contractor along to check it out and he too told us not to buy it (and he’d get paid to renovate it!). We made an offer anyway and after 3 weeks, we agreed on a price.</p>

<p>Now for the inspection…</p>

        <article>
          <p>The second annual <a href="http://seattlebeerweek.com">Seattle Beer Week</a> came and I only made it to one event, like “last year”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/05/13/date-night-2/. Tonight, we took the kids into West Seattle to <a href="http://www.circawestseattle.com/">Circa</a>. Circa was having a <a href="http://stonebrew.com">Stone</a> event so they had 4 Stone beers on tap: Levitation Ale, Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale, Ruination IPA and Imperial Russian Stout. We’d never even heard of the first two and have never had any of them on tap. I love their Imperial Russian Stout and make it a point to get it when they make it two times a year, so I was happy to see that and knew I would have it for my dessert beer.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>While we waited for a table, I went to the bar to get the Ruination IPA. I was almost done with it by the time we got our table. Gay ordered the Sublimely Self-Righteous and when I was done, I ordered Russian River’s Pliny The Elder, which was also on tap. We quickly ordered food for the kids since it was getting late and they were very hungry. While they ate, we ordered our food. I got the venison braised in Stone’s Imperial Russian Stout (yum!) and Gay ordered the beef. For dessert, I had the creme brulee, which was huge and very good with the sweet stout. Gay and the kids got chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream. A representative from Stone gave us a few stickers and we were heading to the 8:10pm ferry. The kids were very well-behaved and quiet, which is always a risk when taking them out these days, especially so close to their bedtime. It was a fun time and I’m glad I got to attend at least one event this year. Next year, I hope to do more.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/23/magazine/23strikes-t.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">published an article</a> about a friend of ours (the husband of a friend of Gay’s), Mike Romano, about his work to get egregious life-terms under California’s strict 3-strikes policy overturned. I’m all for locking career criminals up for life, but not for petty crimes. Accused murderers get more free legal resources, and a better chance of acquittal or successful appeal, than those accused of their 3rd strike:</p>

<blockquote>In practical terms, Romano points out, the difference between being  convicted of capital murder and a small-time third strike is this: a  murderer is entitled to a far greater share of legal resources.  California spends at least $300,000 on the defense side of a capital  murder trial. The courts give extra scrutiny to each capital appeal that  comes before them. And it's only in death-penalty cases that the state  pays lawyers to file a writ of habeas corpus, the route to challenging a  conviction once direct appeal has been exhausted.</blockquote>

<p>The article talks of a guy who was convicted of three thefts over 15 years amounting to a few hundred dollars in property. He was thrown in jail for the rest of his life.</p>

<blockquote>In court, Romano and his students don't simply argue that their clients  are minor offenders who don't deserve to spend the rest of their lives  in prison. ... Romano argues that, as in capital cases, his clients deserve to ask for  lesser sentences based on "mitigating evidence" -- often of child abuse,  mental illness or mental retardation.</blockquote>

<p>Mike’s a lawyer who is using his powers for good instead of evil. (That’s a joke, I have a ton of respect for good lawyers).</p>

          <p>We planned to go to the <a href="http://www.alwaysfreshgoodness.com/">Volunteer Park Cafe</a> last night and made a reservation the day before. We ended up not being able to make it so I called to cancel my reservation. I always do this and even call when we’re running late for a reservation because it’s the right thing to do. I imagine most people don’t call and just don’t show up so the restaurant is left holding a table too long. I assume that’s why I’ve <em>always</em> been thanked for it. I was surprised, however, when the person I talked to wasn’t appreciative and sarcastically said “Thanks for canceling at the super last-minute” (“super last-minute” being three hours before the 7pm reservation). I thought it was such bad form that I posted my <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/volunteer-park-cafe-and-marketplace-seattle#hrid:0xBAegCMomVD2h40esl2BA">first-ever review on Yelp</a> about it.</p>

<p>This afternoon, having seen the review, the manager called me to apologize and explain that it was him I talked to and that  he was having a stressful day. He was very contrite. Little things like that go a long way and I have a lot more respect for someone who can admit that they were wrong and apologize for it.</p>
