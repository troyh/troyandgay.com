              <p>The <a href="http://www.nbdesigngroup.net/">interior designers</a> completed the first round of elevations for the rooms they’re doing: the kitchen, all the bathrooms and the laundry room. 30 pages of drawings! These specify the exact locations of sinks, faucets, appliances, wall sconces, cabinetry, shelving, shower heads and controls (even the locations of toilet paper holders) as well as wall and floor surfaces. They also included a complete list of fixtures and tiles, although we aren’t yet decided on all of those yet.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>They also had to decide how the kitchen windows would be changed to fit the new kitchen. They surprised us by doing just one big window rather than two on either side of the stove. I don’t know why we never considered a single window; it looks great. They also got my shower controls on the outside of the shower, something I’ve wanted in a shower for decades – I hate having to get into the shower to turn it on and try not to get a splash of freezing cold water on me and my clothes. They also did a nice laundry room cabinetry design with a built-in drying rack and ironing board.</p>

<p>We have some changes we want to make but, as they’ve always done with us, they got 90% of everything right on the first try.</p>

              <p>It took a few more days than planned, but Todd at Olson Kundig got the documentation together today. Gay went in to pick it up and take it to the <a href="http://www.cityofseattle.net/dpd/">Seattle DPD</a> to get our permit.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4953961393/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4080/4953961393_2847631401.jpg" alt="Permitted to build!" /></a></p>

<p>The structural engineer had some concerns about the changes we were making and initially said we’d need to add three beams to the main floor, a floor we are trying not to disturb at all, and reinforce the concrete footings in the basement. He asked to see the existing structure in the walls and ceilings in the first floor and to see the basement foundation. Schuchart/Dow opened up a couple walls and dug into the basement floor to give him access. He did his math and determined that the existing house structure is good enough. It turns out that the main floor had two steel beams at the north and south walls of the foyer. This house sure was built well. How many houses built in 1909 have steel beams? The footings in the basement also are much deeper than they thought at first.</p>

<p>The structural engineer did require us to strengthen the rafters in the roof because we are adding insulation and drywall to the attic ceiling, which increases the load. And the garage requires a new steel beam because we are lowering the floor above the garage to use for storage and it will carry more weight. The existing steel beam is also very rusty due to water damage from a leaky roof.</p>

<p>The building permit doesn’t cover the garage because the permit clerk couldn’t find any documentation on the garage in the records for the house because it was built so long ago. Without that, he couldn’t be sure that we aren’t changing its original use or even that the garage is legally built. He approved the permit for the house only. He told Gay to go to the microfiche department to find old records of the garage. There was nothing on microfiche, but they did find a building permit for the garage in 1911 in the original Seattle ledger, a book that is practically disintegrating. So this should be adequate evidence to prove that the garage was legally built as a garage. The old permit application also mentions a greenhouse on top of the garage, so that may be enough to prevent it from being considered a “change of use”. Gay got an appointment with the planning review people for September 30 where we can try to get the permit for the garage and, hopefully, do it without a plan review and get it that day.</p>

<p>But at least we can do the work on the load-bearing walls in the house now. And once we get the final estimate from Schuchart/Dow for everything we’re doing, we can work on getting the construction loan.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Hudson was born <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/25/hudsons-birth/">2 years ago today</a> and he’s come a long way. He’s still a great sleeper and is mostly very laid-back. He follows his sister everywhere and he puts up with a lot of abuse from her but has recently been fighting back and asserting himself. He has a big vocabulary but needs work on his pronunciation. For example, he says “No” for No and “Nyah” for Yes, which are often hard to distinguish and he pronounces his sister’s name “A-wana”, better than “Wa-wa” from a few months ago.</p>

<p>He loves cars and trucks, which surprises me because I certainly haven’t taught that. His favorite toys are always cars and trucks, he points out trucks on the road and his favorite movie is Pixar’s <em>Cars</em>.</p>

<p>He hates wearing shoes and always wants his shoes off. He seems to have a bug bit allergy as he gets very swollen. He hasn’t had any big injuries since <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/03/11/hudsons-first-stitches/">cutting his eyebrow</a> in March, but he’s had quite a few minor ones – he’s just more clumsy than Havana was at his age, I think because his head (90th percentile) is so big relative to his body (55th percentile).</p>

<p>He’s not close to potty-training, although recently has started to sit on the potty to mimic his sister, but doesn’t understand  what he’s supposed to do. He loves peanut butter and honey sandwiches, chocolate Cheerios, dried and fresh blueberries and cashews.</p>

<p>For his birthday, we got him <em>Toy Story</em> and <em>Toy Story 2</em> DVDs since he loves the <em>Toy Story</em> book on the iPad. We gave him a bunch of books and his big present was a bouncy house, that he can share with Havana. He loved the one we rented for Havana’s birthday so we set up the bouncy house for him but he didn’t want to go in it. Havana sure did, though. We eventually got him in if I went in with him and helped him jump and he liked it more.</p>

<p>We had dinner and then birthday cake. They watched half of <em>Toy Story</em> and then went to bed.</p>

<p>Happy Birthday, Hudson!</p>

              <p>Hudson had his 2-year doctor’s appointment today, so Gay and I had alone time with him today while Havana had Kelly all to herself. He was weighed and measured, his doc looked him over, he got one shot and we were on our way. Now he only needs to see the doctor once a year. Congratulations, Hudson.

<p>We went down the street to Metropolitan Market to get some sushi, pasta salad, cherries and some cookies to-go. Hudson fell asleep in the car on the way to the house, so to give him more nap time, I ran into the liquor store to get a bottle of Maker’s 46 – you’re welcome Hudson. He woke up so on after we got to the house. We had lunch on the patio while waiting for Katie and the window guy, Troy (I like him already), to arrive. We chatted with Colin, who got engaged on vacation last week, and he told us that a gift was dropped off at the house. It was two bottles of wine and some homemade bread from one of the people who grew up in the house. With it was a nice card welcoming us to the house.</p>

<p>While Gay walked around with Katie and the window guy, I called Qwest’s tech support (Why is this so hard?) to get the DSL modem set up so the crew has internet access. Doug also arrived to talk about the advice that the structural engineer, <a href="http://swensonsayfaget.com/homepage.html">Swenson Say Fagét</a>, gave upon his review of the plans and the  house last week. Some of what he said is a concern to us because he thinks the first floor needs new beams in the ceiling to support the changes we’re making on the 2nd floor. We think there already are beams there and we aren’t really changing load-bearing walls or changing the way the load is distributed from above, so neither us or the contractor understand why he thinks this is necessary. Doug is going to talk to him directly and get some clarification.</p>

<p>In the attic, the engineer suggested that we either do nothing with the existing cross-ties or, if we want to get rid of them, to put 3 steel cross-ties in as well as a steel C-beam across all the rafters and put a steel beam underneath the peak of the roof. I think that would look great and open up the space, but Tom thinks we should leave it as-is. <em>Wha?!</em> He thinks that the skylights will bring in so much light that it’s not necessary to really open up the space. Whenever we disagree with Tom we later realize he is right, but I think this time may be different. Gay’s more willing to go with Tom. We need to talk to him and see if he can convince me or I can convince him (who can convince Gay).</p>
