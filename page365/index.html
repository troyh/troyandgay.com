            <p>Whoa, is the mainstream media actually starting to understand the meaning of “free software”? <a href="http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20030731.gttwtico31/BNStory/einsider/?query=Linux">The Globe And Mail</a>:</p>

<p>Myth: Linux succeeds only because it’s free.</p>

<p>Reality: Linux is free, therefore hard to compete with. But it’s not that it’s just like free beer. It’s also free like the English language, in that anyone can see how it works and add new parts that make it better. And it’s free in that it runs on computers from many manufacturers, meaning more competition. Linux is also better. It’s reliable. It doesn’t crash much. It resists hacker attacks. With Linux you can have your cake (openness and competition) and eat it too (dependability)._</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Our good friend Nicki is leaving Sunday for a 3 month trial job in New York City.  We had a lovely dinner to say goodbye last night (with friends Eric &amp; Steve as well).  This is such a great opportunity: “try out New York, no strings attached, we pay your rent…”  I’m quite jealous, and at the same time, saying goodbye always makes you realize you should spend more time with your friends before the bon voyage parties.  As an aside, we heard a HORROR story about a dinner they had at <a href="http://www.theherbfarm.com/Index2.tmpl">The Herbfarm</a>, one of Seattle’s most expensive restaurants.  For a prix fixe menu well over $100/person you would not expect servers to rudely grab unfinished plates, balk at requests for coffee, loudly announce the mistake of providing an expired credit card, to only begrudgingly provide wine information, to not accommodate outdoor smokers. …actually the list goes on…did I mention that they lectured the customers for 45 minutes before dinner on every detail of the place and the meal in such a way as to make everyone aware of just how lucky they are to be at their pretentious establishment, and yet all the gaudy restaurant decorations are not so subtlety advertised for sale – how tacky.</p>

            <p>Just two days after the cancellation of his “bet on which Americans will die next” plan, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3115135.stm">Poindexter plans to retire</a>. Poindexter is also the creator of the <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/iao/TIASystems.htm">Total Information Awareness</a> program, trying to get rid of those pesky civil rights we Americans enjoy. I guess the Bush Administration will need to find someone else to skirt The Constitution. Does <a href="http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/60.htm">Joseph McCarthy</a> have any offspring?</p>

            <p>If there was any doubt that the Pentagon enjoys death and destruction, their <a href="http://www.policyanalysismarket.org/index.html">organized betting</a> on terrorist attacks proves it. I’m sure this is just the DoD’s way of insulting the CIA &amp; FBI because, for some reason, they all hate each other, but to actually defend it is even dumber. Now, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/07/29/terrorist.market.ap/index.html">they’re going to stop it</a>, at least stop it from being public. Government at work.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2003_07_01_archive.asp#105950543265868558">William Gibson makes a good point</a>, though: “The last time DARPA got too imaginative, we wound up with the Internet. “</p>
