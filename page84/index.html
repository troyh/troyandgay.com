              <p>We were supposed to go to Schuchart/Dow’s office to go over the estimate today but after yesterday’s ferry trouble that we didn’t want to repeat, and because Kelly wanted to leave early for a long weekend we’d lose child care, we decided we’d do a conference call instead.
<!-- more --></p>

<p>We had preliminary cost estimates based on vague ideas about our plans. But now that we had design schematics, they could get better estimates. They provided us with the latest estimate and schedule. That meeting went well, about what we expected. We’ve decided to forego insulation altogether other than in the roof and basement. We’re leaning towards a finished concrete floor in the basement too, as opposed to a concrete subfloor with carpeting or something else on top.</p>

<p>The architects are still working on some minor changes and still need to finish our office moving wall, skylights, roof cross-ties, garage, basement stairs and the “barn doors” that will show up in various places in the house. The designers will be working on “elevations” of the kitchen, bathrooms, etc. so we know how the cabinetry, other casework, etc. will look and refining our choices for fixtures and floors.</p>

<p>We will start working with a lighting guy who can help us decide how built-in lighting will be done in the kitchen, basement and offices. Next week, we’ll visit the plumbing showroom to look at fixtures in real life and also at kitchen appliances at the appliance place.</p>

<p>The goal is to have everything decided in the next few weeks so we can start construction with minimal changes while the work is going on. That’s the goal, at least.</p>

<p>We are now getting an idea of how our vision for the house will start becoming a reality.</p>

              <p>It took us 2 hours to get over to Seattle today because of ferry delays due to morning fog. Hey Vashon bridge opponents: a bridge always runs on time!</p>

<p>We stopped at the house to do some measurements on the garage and we walked around a bit in the house. The asbestos abatement company is doing their work this week, so nothing much else is going on.</p>

<p>We made a quick stop at Swedish medical center for Gay to give blood for a study they’re doing on pregnancy and migraines – she doesn’t have migraines, she’s in the control group. Side note: During the last pregnancy, she gave blood for a study trying to see if it was possible to identify and extract baby’s cells from the mother’s blood rather than from the amniotic fluid. It turns out the work was successful so, in a few years, the dangerous method of poking a big needle into a pregnant woman’s stomach will be a thing of the past. Very cool.</p>

<p>We then went to the interior designer’s office to see what they’ve picked out for the house. As usual, they did a great job. We wanted them to try to maintain the style of the house but have a more contemporary look and feel. Ideally, the house would look more like a modern version of the original rather than an old house that was obviously remodeled. Hard to do, especially when you also want modern conveniences and appliances. They picked “subway tile” for our bathroom to recreate the original white tiles of the time, but they look just slightly more modern. I love that. They also picked out some great marble hexagon tiles for the kids’ bathroom that look very much like the original tile that was there, but marble. The marble for the master bathroom and kitchen island looks very classic. They picked a dark wood for cabinetry throughout the house so match the dark wood that already exists in the house. They picked a very cool dark kitchen tile floor with rough edges – it looks very old and worn – and a nice granite for the kitchen counters. They had a great idea for the wood from the Monkey Trees on the powder room counter, which could look amazing. The fixtures for all the sinks is a little up in the air. They picked nice ones, but they’re expensive <a href="http://www.dornbracht.com/en/">Dornbracht</a> fixtures, and we just don’t love them enough to justify the cost. They also picked all the sinks in the kitchen and bathrooms and the back splash for the butler’s pantry.</p>

              <p>Great “article on Meyer-Wells”:http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/business/energy-environment/08sustain.html?_r=3 in the NY Times on Saturday. 4 or 5 years ago, they did two fireplace mantles, the casework for our bookshelf in our bedroom and a really cool side table that we put our drinks on every night. Glad to see their business is doing well. We’re talking to them about making something out of the Monkey Puzzle Trees we’re going to take down. They’ve never worked with wood from a Monkey Puzzle Tree so they’re excited about it. I hope we can turn those hideous things into something beautiful.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Kelly worked today to watch the kids so we could go to Megan’s 40th Birthday Party tonight. We stopped at the grocery store to pick up beer, our assignment for the party. I got some good beers too, that was the best beer selection at a party I’ve been to in a long time! :) Gay made a fruit salad, a pasta salad and crab cakes. Jon bbq’d a salmon and brought the cake. Mary and Melanie made bbq’d corn and had a bunch of appetizers and wine out.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>As usual, we had to leave early to catch a reasonable ferry back so Kelly could go home. We can’t move back into the city soon enough.</p>

<p>More proof we live in a small world: The party was at Mary &amp; Melanie’s house, friends of Megan, and Mary went to law school with the youngest kid of the people who we bought our house from. She even had been to the house to study a few times in the 90s. They still keep in touch and figured out, independently of us, that the family sold the house to us. What are the odds of that?</p>

<p>She told her that the previous offer on the house a year earlier was from an older woman who wanted it as a second home that she’d use while visiting Seattle. The family didn’t like that. I think the deal fell apart over price, but she said they were much happier that we are going to live there full-time and raise kids there.</p>
