              <p>This afternoon I heard and felt two loud explosions that shook the house. It felt like a bomb went off at the neighbor’s house. I thought it was a big earthquake because you always hear a loud sound when an earthquake starts. It turns out that Obama was in Seattle today (<a href="http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2009/01/07/when-and-where-obama-lived-on-this-capitol-hill">he lived on Capitol Hill as an infant</a>, by the way), a small sea plane inadvertently entered the restricted airspace around the President, <a href="http://www.kirotv.com/news/24664589/detail.html">two F-15 fighters scrambled to intercept</a> causing a sonic boom. I’ve never heard one before. The Pacific Northwest Seismic Network <a href="http://www.king5.com/news/local/Puget-Sound-area-rocked-by-sonic-booms-100922594.html?gallery=y&amp;c=y&amp;img=1#gallery-image">captured it</a> on their instruments.</p>

              <p>Got up at 5:30am, had breakfast, Kelly got here a little early and we got on the 8:15a ferry. Went to <a href="http://albertleeappliance.com/">Albert Lee</a> to look at appliances, <a href="http://www.bestplumbing.com/">Best Plumbing</a> and <a href="http://www.seattleinteriors.com/">Seattle Interiors</a> to look at fixtures, had a delicious lunch and a beer at <a href="http://brouwerscafe.blogspot.com/">Brouwer’s Cafe</a> and then went to Schuchart/Dow’s office to tour their metal shop and their wood shop. They have a very cool office space with lots of the exposed wood and steel plating that we like. The metal shop is industrial with big steel workbenches that came from Boeing. They were building a huge steel table for a client that was going to have an ice bucket in the middle of it. I wish I had taken a photo of it. The wood shop was building a couple sets of cabinetry and, thanks to my ability to ask a lot of dumb questions, we got a little education on wood and laminates. They’ll be building our cabinetry and I assume the metal shop will be making the steel for our deck railings and parts of doors.</p>

<p>Katie then took us to a few houses they worked on to see pivot doors they’ve made so we could see what we think of them and how we want ours to work. The walls in our family room will be doors that open up to create a bigger indoor/outdoor space. They’re too big to be supported by hinges, so they will pivot open instead. We wanted to see and touch similar doors. We were concerned that they’d be too heavy and difficult to open, but they aren’t. And they look very nice. We also saw a few “barn doors” in different styles that will be in various around the house. I can’t wait to see what our doors are going to look like.</p>

<p>We learned a few things at Albert Lee:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>All microwaves are made by either LG, Sharp or Panasonic. LG makes 80% of all microwaves, Sharp makes most of the rest and Panasonic makes a small number. Other brands put their case around them and different electronics to provide features (quick timers, reheat, popcorn, etc).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Microwave carousels are useless but people think they need them and won’t buy one without a carousel so they all have them. Microwaves heat the food uniformly but food naturally has cold and hot spots that people think carousels eliminate. They don’t. Stir the food instead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commercial Wolf stoves are made by Wolf, residential Wolf stoves are made by Sub-Zero (the parent company of Wolf).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

              <p>Gay got her iPhone 4 today. Great device; the screen is better than printed paper, FaceTime seems to work well, the speakerphone is much better and it just feels better to hold. We’ll see how long I can hold out before I have to have one.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>We were supposed to go to Schuchart/Dow’s office to go over the estimate today but after yesterday’s ferry trouble that we didn’t want to repeat, and because Kelly wanted to leave early for a long weekend we’d lose child care, we decided we’d do a conference call instead.
<!-- more --></p>

<p>We had preliminary cost estimates based on vague ideas about our plans. But now that we had design schematics, they could get better estimates. They provided us with the latest estimate and schedule. That meeting went well, about what we expected. We’ve decided to forego insulation altogether other than in the roof and basement. We’re leaning towards a finished concrete floor in the basement too, as opposed to a concrete subfloor with carpeting or something else on top.</p>

<p>The architects are still working on some minor changes and still need to finish our office moving wall, skylights, roof cross-ties, garage, basement stairs and the “barn doors” that will show up in various places in the house. The designers will be working on “elevations” of the kitchen, bathrooms, etc. so we know how the cabinetry, other casework, etc. will look and refining our choices for fixtures and floors.</p>

<p>We will start working with a lighting guy who can help us decide how built-in lighting will be done in the kitchen, basement and offices. Next week, we’ll visit the plumbing showroom to look at fixtures in real life and also at kitchen appliances at the appliance place.</p>

<p>The goal is to have everything decided in the next few weeks so we can start construction with minimal changes while the work is going on. That’s the goal, at least.</p>

<p>We are now getting an idea of how our vision for the house will start becoming a reality.</p>
