              <p>We’re both getting tired of Ubud. So we spent most of the day at the villa by the pool and reading. Fortunately, the chainsaws were only running part of the day. We went into Ubud for lunch and came right back home for more nothing-doing. And it was a humid day with little or no breeze. I was sweating just sitting in a chair and couldn’t drink enough water. This is DC-style humidity. I’m ready to see the beach (and the breeze off the water) again.</p>

              <p>Instead of calling our driver, we walked into Ubud from the villa. It’s not a terribly long walk, but the lack of a sidewalk, the uneven road surface and the hot humid weather makes it feel long. We happened across Naughty Nuri’s, a place that we had read about in a local book that is unique because they sell martinis. Martinis, and cocktails in general, are very rare in Bali. It was hot, we were tired of walking and it was lunch time so we decided to stop in to see how good the martinis really are.</p>

<p>The glasses came out of the freezer and put on the table in front of us and then the waitress poured from the shaker into our glasses, right to the rim. The exactness of the measuring was a marvel in itself. Another drop in either glass would have overflowed the glass.</p>

<p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_1868.jpg" alt="IMG_1868.jpg" /></p>

<p>As we were finishing our lunch and martini, the owner sat down at our table and asked us how we liked the martinis. An hour or so later, we heard his story, the story of the restaurant and discovered that some friends of his lived in the Seattle area (an island off the coast of Olympia). He called his friends and I got on the phone to talk to him. He and his wife run a salt business in Bali and knew the <a href="http://seasalt.com">Salt Works</a> people we know in Seattle. Small world.</p>

<p>Brian, the owner of Naught Nuri’s, is a New Yorker who one day decided to leave his brother-in-law’s successful car business and travel in Asia. He found Bali and decided to make it a home. He met Nuri, a Balinese woman, got married, opened the restaurant and had a kid. He’s been here for 10 years now and his kid, who we met, is 3.</p>

<p>We had some beers (draft Bintang!) and then walked down the street and did some shopping before returning to Nuri’s for another drink. By this time, it was getting crowded and we realized that Nuri’s is a hangout for expats. We met a German guy, a Canadian guy and an Australian guy (who demanded to know what is so naughty about Nuri) all who lived in Bali at least part of the year.</p>

<p>They also helped explain some of the questions we had about Bali and its people. They even have an acronym for some of the unexplainable behavior of Indonesians: ILF, Indonesian Logic Fatigue. :)  Of the things we learned, we discovered, at least according to Brian, that although kids all go to school, reading is not a priority. Many kids get out of school still not able to read. No explanation other than ILF.</p>

<p>We went home and found our crew of three cooking for dinner. The previous night we told them to make enough food for everyone and asked that they eat dinner with us. But the table was only set for two when we arrived. So we set three more places at the table and helped serve everything. The idea was that we would get to know them, but we only learned how shy three young (22, 22 and 19) Balinese kids can be. :)  About the only thing we learned besides their ages were that Nyoman went to school to be a chef and wanted to be a professional chef. Ketut and Wayan weren’t able to tell us what their plans were.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>I thought this debate was far more lopsided in Kerry’s favor than the first presidential debate, but the polls so far show it much closer. Did anyone see Kerry’s complete command of the facts and figures while Bush continued to just make platitudes?! Maybe I’m biased after Bush referred to web sites as “the internets”. ;)</p>

<p>One thing that struck me was when Bush said “I was not happy when they didn’t find any [WMDs]”. Why was he unhappy? If he was so concerned that Iraq was putting WMDs into the hands of the terrorists they harbored, wouldn’t he be ecstatic that his fears were unwarranted? For someone who claims to be protecting our country, I am terrified that he <em>wanted</em> WMDs to be found.</p>

<p>And when Bush said “I’m a good steward of the environment”…. WOW…. did <em>anyone</em> fall for that?!</p>

<p>Bush said he would only pick a Supreme Court judge who interprets the Constitution and then went on to say that he wouldn’t pick a judge who would remove “Under God” from the pledge of allegiance. Hey Bush, that ruling was made from a strict interpretation of the Constitution, you know, the whole “separation of church and state” that is pretty central to the Constitution. And citing the Dred Scott case as an example of what he doesn’t want our Supreme Court to do? Good to know that Bush doesn’t support slavery. I’m with him there. But was he trying to imply that Kerry is for slavery?</p>

<p>When asked specifically for three examples of mistakes he made, Bush couldn’t name a single one. Crikey.</p>

<p>And Kerry, when Bush criticized the UN for not being able to get Hussein out of power, said:</p>

<p><em>The goal of the sanctions was not to remove Saddam Hussein, it was to remove the weapons of mass destruction. And, Mr. President, just yesterday the Duelfer report told you and the whole world they worked. He didn’t have weapons of mass destruction, Mr. President. That was the objective. And if we’d used smart diplomacy, we could have saved $200 billion and an invasion of Iraq. And right now, Osama bin Laden might be in jail or dead. That’s the war against terror.</em></p>

<p>In other words, if we were smart, we’d be $200 billion richer, Iraq would still be powerless and bin Laden wouldn’t still be bombing hotels in Egypt. But, of course, Bush still won’t say what he wants to say: that kicking Saddam out of power <em>was</em> his objective.</p>

              <p>This is what our cook calls me – I love it.  Troy is just “Mr.” luckily; he has a hard enough time being called “Mr. Jillmore” because I made many of the hotel reservations.</p>

<p>Speaking of names, in Bali (we haven’t determined yet whether this is true for all of Indonesia), there are only 4:  the first child (boy or girl) is named Wayan; the second, Made; the third, Ngyoman; and the fourth, Ketut.  After that, they start over again.  There is some word for “the second”, as in “Wayan, the second” but we didn’t catch exactly what it is.  I would think this would be highly confusing.  Our housekeeper (female) is “Wayan”, as is our driver (male).  We regularly pass dozens of “Made’s Warungs (shops)” and “Wayan’s Cafes”.  I would imagine the family name would be more prominent, but we have yet to hear anyone use it.</p>

<p>We have learned very little of the Indonesian Bahasa language (which is spoken more than the native Balinese or other local dialects now), but we say “Thank you” a lot, which is funny because their version is 5 syllables so you begin to feel like a doof saying it so much.  One thing we are struggling to learn are the various “Good day”s.  You say “Selamat pagi” (good morning) until 11am, then “Selamat siang” (good day) from 11am til 3pm, then “Selamat sore” (good afternoon) from 3pm until 7pm, and then “Selamat malam” (good evening) after that.  Not only do they observe more “sections” of the day than we do, they are slightly different.</p>

<p>One linguistic convention I think is clever, yet presents more difficulty to us, is the two forms of goodbye.  If you are leaving you say “Selamat tinggal”, but the person who is being left says “Selamat jalan” (note the similarity to the various good days).</p>

<p>Funniest Bahasa so far: the word for water is “air”.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Speaking of buying alcohol, it’s strange here. When you go to a grocery store, the alcohol (excluding beer) is in a separate section. In the grocery store in Ubud, it looks like how you’d see jewelry being sold in the US – it’s in a glass case with a clerk standing behind it. Except in this case, there’s four clerks squeezed behind a counter about 6 feet long.</p>

<p>You tell them what you want and one of the clerks starts filling out the paperwork while another opens the case and gets the bottles you ordered. The paperwork takes a while, so the other three clerks tend to just stand there. This is something you see in socialist countries – restaurants routinely have more staff than customers, for example.</p>

<p>Once the paperwork is filled out, you get a copy and you take that to the cashier. The cashier then leaves the register and goes back to the alcohol counter to get your order. By this time, the two bottles of wine had a rubber band around them with another copy of the paperwork attached to them.</p>

<p>At the other place we bought alcohol (the <a href="http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2846">Walmart-like place</a>), the process was similar. But we could actually walk into the section and pick up the bottles we wanted. As we left, a woman standing there stops us, takes the bottles, fills out the paperwork, gives you a copy and you are allowed to take the bottles to the cashier yourself. Another difference was that the alcohol section only had the good wine and other alcohol. Cheaper wine and beer was available in a totally different location in the store.</p>
