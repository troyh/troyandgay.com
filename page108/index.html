              <p>The survey of the property complete, we are back to working with the architects to talk about location and basic structure of the house.</p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/l-2048-1536-f4a2b768-ea0a-43bc-8bb7-066c7d6864fc11.jpeg"><img src="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/l-2048-1536-f4a2b768-ea0a-43bc-8bb7-066c7d6864fc11.jpeg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>According to the survey, our property rises 50 feet (5 stories!) from the lowest point to the highest point. It sure doesn’t feel like that big a slope when you walk it, though. This makes it difficult to place the house given that moving dirt to level the grade is expensive and not always feasible.</p>

<p>They’ve worked up a couple ideas for the basic structure and location for the house, we gave our feedback and we’ll have another iteration soon.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Now that <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/08/30/snow-leopard-broke-control-and-caps-lock-swapping/">my huge problem</a> is solved, I can say what I really think of Snow Leopard: it’s definitely worth $29.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3864938283/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3491/3864938283_6762b087b8.jpg" alt="Snow Leopard (aka, &quot;Windows 3000&quot;)" /></a></p>

<p>Technically, we got the Family Pack so it cost us $49. On that topic, I love Apple’s Family Pack option. It’s totally unenforced, I could have bought the $29 version and installed it on several computers and Apple wouldn’t know, but I don’t because they offer a Family Pack option and trust me enough to pay what I really should pay for it. So I do it. This is something no one at Microsoft can get their heads around so they have onerous copy protection that ends up annoying legitimate people (like me!) more than pirates who seem to have no trouble at all pirating Windows. And on the topic of price, Microsoft is charging outrageous prices ($240 and up) for Windows 7 which only exists because Vista was such crap – Windows 7 should be free and come with a handwritten apology from every developer of Windows to everyone who suffered with their screwups. To their credit, they are offering a Family Pack with discounted pricing, but I’m sure it has the same annoying copy protection that always gets in your way.</p>

<p>Back to Snow Leopard…</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I gained 15GB of disk space after installing it. Apple claims people can get back up to 20GB, which is either impressive for Snow Leopard or shows how wasteful previous versions of OS X were. Nevertheless, when was the last time an OS upgrade gave you <em>more</em> disk space? I don’t think that’s ever happened for me, even Linux, the paragon of performance, gets bigger each version. That alone is worth $5-10 of the cost.</p>

<p>Snow Leopard is noticeably faster than Leopard. It’s not huge, 10% by some benchmarks, but it’s noticeable and appreciated. Apps seem to launch and run faster, waking up from sleep is faster, Dashboard is much faster, etc. This is not unusual, OSs are supposed to get faster with each release. Even Microsoft’s OSs used to do this: DOS 4, 5 and 6 each were faster than their predecessor and Windows 98 was much faster than Win95. Too bad Microsoft started getting lazy and relying on Intel to make computers faster.</p>

<p>Quicktime X is great simply because you can edit the videos without having to buy Quicktime Pro, which used to cost $30. I guess it has some fewer features than Pro does, but I never used them, I guess. And I love how it looks with the borderless window.</p>

<p>You can now have minimized apps get minimized into the Dock icon rather than to the right side of the Dock. I love this, I hated having a bunch of minimized icons sitting over there stretching out the Dock.</p>

<p>Exposé is easier to use, you just hold down the Dock icon and it shows you all the windows for the app. This is small but handy as I never got used to the F9 and F10 keys to do this.</p>

<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2009/08/mac-os-x-10-6.ars/">The definitive review</a> is much more in-depth.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Apple just released the first update (10.6.1) and it makes my Canon LIDE 60 scanner work natively with Image Capture! I don’t need Canon’s drivers or their terrible software to scan documents now. That alone is worth the $29 for Snow Leopard.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p><strong>9/1/2009 Update:</strong> The problem turned out to be related to the wireless USB hub fo<a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/mice_pointers/mice/devices/130&amp;cl=US,EN">r Logitech’s MX Revolution</a> (and others?) mouse. If you unplug it before you change the Modifier Keys the changes do take effect. You can then plug the Logitech USB dongle back in and everything works fine. I tried every combination of plugging my keyboard into my computer but the Logitech dongle was plugged into the back of my display so I didn’t think to try it. <a href="http://mtrichardson.com/">Michael Richardson</a> figured it out.</p>

<p>I installed Snow Leopard this morning and discovered that they broke the most important feature of any OS: swapping Caps Lock and Control. The Control key isn’t used much by most users, but developers use it all the time. In fact, it’s safe to say that no developer worth his/her salt doesn’t swap their Control and Caps Lock keys and I haven’t had an OS in decades that didn’t do this… until now. Actually, Mac OS X didn’t do this officially until 10.4, but you could edit a .plist file to swap the keys, which was good enough. In 10.4 they conveniently put the feature in System Preferences and officially supported it. Until Snow Leopard broke it. Not even <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20020222094159459">the manual way to change it</a> works anymore.</p>

<p>To be clear, this setting in the System Preferences Keyboard pane has no effect whatsoever, not just for Caps Lock but for any of the keys:</p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/screen-shot-2009-08-30-at-25523-pm.png"><img src="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/screen-shot-2009-08-30-at-25523-pm.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>It’s bad that the retarded <em>[Update after finding out the true cause of the problem: My apologies to the Apple developer for calling them “retarded”, I should be calling the Logitech developer “retarded” because they obviously did something non-standard with their driver for the USB dongle]</em> developer that broke this didn’t even bother to test their change themselves. It’s inexcusable that the entire time this was broken during the development of Snow Leopard (12 months?) <em>nobody at Apple noticed it</em>, not even their developers.</p>

<p>This is like an auto mechanic never noticing that his wrench is broken. Or a bartender never noticing that his corkscrew doesn’t work.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>That no developer noticed this means that either the developers at Apple don’t use the Control key or they don’t mind bending their pinky back to reach the normal Control key the 3,000 times a day that every programmer’s editor requires that you use the Control key. It’s not possible that they don’t use the Control key because even the crappy editor in XCode, Apple’s development IDE, makes heavy use of the Control key. In my 20+ years of software development I have never known an editor that doesn’t use the Control key more than any other key. Even vi, the (great) editor whose design goes to great lengths to avoid using anything other than alphanumeric keys, uses the Control key heavily.</p>

<p>So the only logical conclusion is that Apple’s developers use the Control key in that god-awful location in the lower-left of the keyboard. That’s good, because it means that Apple will one day get sued by all their employees for the injuries that keystroke causes.</p>

<p>How long until 10.6.1 comes out? 3 months? 4 months? And will it even be fixed in that??! Apple is notoriously slow at fixing bugs or even acknowledging them, especially ones like this they obviously think is minor, that they make Microsoft look downright responsive to bug-fixes. Sometimes I really really hate Apple.</p>

<p>Postscript: When are we going to finally get rid of the stupid Caps Lock key anyway?!? Who has used that key in the last 40 years? What kind of typist types <em>anything</em> in all caps or can’t be bothered to hold the Shift key down? All Caps were useful back in the 1940s when people didn’t have <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italics</em> or underlines on their typewriters. Why are we still making keyboards with this worthless and dangerous key?</p>

<p>He’s on the verge of walking by himself, I can feel it. And he’s developed a brutal scream that he uses just whenever, not when he’s upset or hurt, just to make noise. Havana is not one to mind loud screams but even she tells him “That’s too loud, Hudson” and “Inside voices” when he does it. He’s been a great baby, is very happy and giggly and laid-back and able to put up with Havana. The next year should be even more fun as he becomes more active and independent and is able to play with Havana more.</p>

              <p>I got the latest Comcast bill notification email and looked at my bill and discovered a charge for $13.40 under Comcast Cable Television:</p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/picture-312.png"><img src="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/picture-312.png?w=300" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The funny thing is that we don’t have Comcast Cable TV. We used to years ago, so I assume that “Inactive DCT Lease” means that we’re being charged for the inactive Digital Cable TV set-top box leases that we used to have (we only had 2, not 4, though). I contacted their customer service and they credited us for the charge and for the charges back to June when they started charging us for this. In June and July they only charged us for one lease. Either someone screwed up in the billing department and this happened to lots of people (likely since the customer service rep seemed not surprised by this and quickly fixed it) or Comcast is evil. I am assuming the former… for now.</p>
