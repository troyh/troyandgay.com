              <p>Kevin &amp; Rachel and Reid &amp; Marissa threw a lovely engagement party for Mark &amp; Emily – only EIGHT years in the making ;-).  Mark’s sister Lisa is about to strike out in her own law practice (let me know if you need a great family law attorney in Seattle).  I just love hearing about people starting their own businesses.  Also learned Stork (Chris) is working on becoming a psychologist; this is after leaving a career as a medical doctor, and a degree in philosophy earned between, I think.  Interesting because he must have the most understanding and supportive wife in the universe (Gwenneth), but also because he was a bit of a hero to me – working in Viet Nam on protheses for land mine victims and then in the burn ward.  Turns out the latter was just too much…he couldn’t handle being around so much death.  One of the most interesting “I’m changing my life” conversations I’ve had…</p>

              <p>Today marks the end of a frustrating week for me. Building another new server for <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> has been difficult and time-consuming and the 2am nights haven’t left much room for sleep. Yes, we build <em>everything</em> ourselves, from software to hardware – we even make our own ethernet cables! Why? Because I’m a big believer that it’s always best to fully understand how the important things work, plus its fun and cost-effective. That was the theory anyway. But it feels like the worst is behind me now. The rest is just software.</p>

<p>On top of that (and my two flat tires on my bike in one day), twice this week my Mac had “kernel panics”. The screen went grey and a <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=107061&amp;SaveKCWindowURL=http%3A%2F%2Fkbase.info.apple.com%2Fcgi-bin%2FWebObjects%2Fkbase.woa%2Fwa%2FSaveKCToHomePage&amp;searchMode=Assisted&amp;kbhost=kbase.info.apple.com&amp;showButton=true&amp;randomValue=100&amp;showSurvey=false&amp;sessionID=9460704!troy@recipezaar.com%7C166457042">white box</a> popped up and told me, in four languages, that I need to restart. But I must say that Macs are pretty even when they crash. From looking at the panic.log that OS X made, it looks like it has something to do with audio. Will send to Apple for advice.</p>
