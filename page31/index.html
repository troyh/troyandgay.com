            <p>After getting the kids off to school, Gay and I drove to Canby, Oregon to visit JVNW. We stopped in Clackamas for lunch at a McMenamin’s (in a strip mall!) with Kevin, our brewer, and then met with the guys at JVNW. It was fun to see the factory, the design and project management areas and then walk through the construction of the tanks at various stages.   </p>

<p>We all then went to <a href="http://laurelwoodbrewpub.com/">Laurelwood</a> in Portland to talk and then Gay and I checked into our hotel before dinner at Higgins. Not sure why, but <a href="http://www.thenines.com/?PS=PS_aa_WWC_WestWestCanada_Google_BD_The_Nines_Portland_Exact_060811_NAD_FM">the hotel</a> upgraded us to the Meier-Frank suite – woulda been even more great if we stayed more than one night.</p>

            <p>We ordered it over 2 months ago and picked up our Mini Countryman today. It was a struggle, but we fit 3 car seats in it and took the kids out for a drive around town and then to dinner in Columbia City. This is the first non-black car I’ve owned of the five since 1995. I’ve wanted a Mini since they came out in 2002, I just needed them to make a 4-door model.</p>

            <p>I passed the <a href="https://cicerone.org/">Cicerone</a> Certified Beer Server test today. </p>

<p>I got 55 of 60 questions correct but did have to study a bit, I doubt I’d have passed without studying. There’s a surprising number of questions about Pilsners. </p>

<p>On to the Certified Cicerone test…</p>

            <p>There’s a movie named after both our daughters:</p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130427-181105.jpg"><img src="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130427-181105.jpg" alt="20130427-181105.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>So, there’s a movie named after me, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332452/">Troy</a>, (starring Brad Pitt as me, good casting!), a movie named after Gay, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116483/?ref_=sr_1">Happy Gilmore</a>, a movie named after Havana, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099747/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Havana</a> starring Robert Redford who I assume plays her father (another brilliant casting choice), a movie kinda named after Hudson, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102070/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Hudson Hawk</a>, two movies named after Eva, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1105740/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_20">Eva</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1298554/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2">Eva</a>, and now a movie named after both Havana and Eva.</p>

<p>If I weren’t dumb and unable to see obvious patterns, I’d trademark the titles “Gay Troy”, “Havana Hudson”, “Hudson Eva”, etc.</p>

            <p>We drove down the Pacific Coast Highway to Legoland. It’s no Disneyland and Hudson was disappointed to find out that it’s not just a big pile of Legos to play with. Havana went on every ride, Hudson refused to go on any rides and Eva was too little to go on any rides. 5 hours there was plenty for me.</p>

<p>Then we drove to San Diego through normally heavy California traffic to see White Labs, one of the two US yeast companies. They have a tasting room where you can get the same beer fermented with different yeast strains to compare the yeast. I also got a quick tour of the facility. </p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130420-101202.jpg"><img src="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130420-101202.jpg" alt="20130420-101202.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Ale Smith, one of my new favorite breweries, is a few minutes away so we stopped there and I picked up some beers (barrel-aged Wee Heavy and Old Numbskull!) and a shirt. Their tap room was packed with people!</p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130420-094508.jpg"><img src="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130420-094508.jpg" alt="20130420-094508.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Then we drove back up to Escondido for dinner at the Stone Brewery and Bistro. It’s a great place with a big garden area outside. The food was okay but more upscale than a typical brewpub menu. I was surprised at how many non-Stone beers they had – I was expecting a lot of Stone one-offs and there was a couple cask versions of their beers, but for the most part, it was a standard Stone beer list. I had Arrogant Bastard, Oaked Arrogant Bastard and the May version of Enjoy By IIPA.</p>
