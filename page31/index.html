          </h3>
            <p>I finally got to brew on my new brewery setup today. 4 months ago I decided I didn’t want to brew outside anymore, I didn’t want to haul all the equipment outside and back inside, I didn’t want to stand around in the cold and rain and, most of all, I was convinced I’d never be able to brew the same beer twice with the equipment I had. </p>

<p>Moving everything into the basement was a great option except I didn’t feel comfortable using two 70,000+ BTU burners inside the house for 4 hours and worrying that the carbon monoxide would kill the wife and kids or, worse, me! To compare, a high-end residential kitchen stove gas burner is 25,000 BTUs, “normal” stove burners are more like 15,000. I also wanted to brew more than 5 gallons at a time, which was about the maximum for my equipment. Time to upgrade!</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Making a dedicated space for brewing meant that I wouldn’t spend 30 minutes before and after brewing to move my equipment outside and back inside the house. I also wouldn’t fill the kitchen and pantry area with all my equipment. I also decided on a <a href="http://beersmith.com/blog/2011/08/11/rims-and-herms-recirculating-infusion-mash-systems-for-beer/">HERMS</a> system to maintain mash temperatures that my converted Rubbermaid coolers couldn’t do. And I wanted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">PID</a>-controlled temperature sensors to maintain temperatures so the process would be consistent batch-to-batch so I can fine-tune recipes that I can brew commercially eventually. And an electric system would eliminate the carbon monoxide danger (although it drastically increases the electrocution danger!). Since I live in Seattle where electricity is generated by water power, environmentalists would be happy that the brewery uses no fossil fuels. </p>

<p>Now I have it all installed and I brewed my first batch on it. It went great, especially considering I was learning an entire new system. The temperature during the mash process was constant, it was constantly being recirculated through the heat exchange coil so the wort should be more clear (hard to tell on the Porter I brewed), because of the constant temperature and the constant recirculation, my efficiency was 85% versus 75% on my previous system (and I expect that to go higher as I get better at using it), moving liquids around is much faster and easy with the pumps, a sink nearby is handy for washing things and throwing dirty things, and I no longer have to worry about running out of propane. If it wasn’t already a huge improvement, the brewery is in the room next to the gym so I could keep an eye on it while I was in the gym and I even worked out during the hour-long mash today. Previously, I had to forego workouts on brew days. </p>

<p>I still have problems to resolve. I make an incredible mess because I’m not used to so many hoses, valves and pumps and am constantly spilling water all over the floor. I’m determined to clean the kettles in-place rather than clean them in the sink and I can’t do that very easily or efficiently yet. The table is the standard 36” table height but the tall kettles make it hard to reach into them to clean them, so I will probably cut 4” off the legs to lower everything. And I need a place to store equipment to dry and still within easy reach.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>The home brewery is finally finished. Or, finished for the time being as I’ve already figured out that I will be changing and improving things as I find what doesn’t work well. After <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2013/02/08/building-the-home-brewery-part-3/">the last update,</a> I installed the backsplash. I cut 4 inches off one of the table legs so that it could fit against the wall. It took me 3 days to install the ventilation duct and inline fan to vent the heat and steam outside the house. That was the hardest part of the job, I built it all twice! I tend to follow the carpenter rule “measure once, cut twice”.</p>

<p>I mounted an electrical box with a fan control and switch to control the speed of the vent fan to keep it quieter when I don’t need it to be 100% power, which is loud. Then I punched a bunch of holes in the kettles to install valves, a temperature probe and a coil of stainless steel tubing in one that acts as a heat exchanger. I mounted the pumps underneath the bottom shelf of the table. I drilled a bunch more holes in the wall to mount hangers to secure all the electrical cords.</p>

<p>After assembling all the pipe fittings and testing for leaks and making some hoses, I was done by Thursday, Valentine’s Day. I had wanted to be done by Tuesday and to brew a Chocolate Cherry Porter on Valentine’s Day, but I missed it by 2 days. Oh well. I ran through a trial brew day with just water to get used to controlling the system and was ready to brew my first batch on Saturday.</p>

            <p>Hudson’s friend’s mom skates for the <a href="http://ratcityrollergirls.com/teams/throttle-rockets/">Throttle Rockets</a>. We went to Key Arena to watch the bout tonight.   </p>

            <p>The plumber removed the old 3-compartment cast iron sink and plumbed in the new sink yesterday. He still has to come back on Monday to run some more plumbing that I need.</p>

<p>The ventilation hood is built and was delivered this morning along with a 4’x9’ sheet of stainless steel that I’ll use as a backsplash. I installed lengths of unistrut on the ceiling and hung threaded rod, which suspends the ventilation hood. I was reminded of how hard it is to drill in the old-growth 100 year-old wood joists in this house!</p>

<p>The control panel I ordered from <a href="http://theelectricbrewery.com/">The Electric Brewery</a> in November finally arrived today. My favorite builder, Schuchart/Dow, let me borrow their hammer drill so I could drill some holes in the concrete wall. I mounted unistrut on the wall and mounted the control panel to that. </p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/20130208-164500.jpg"><img src="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/20130208-164500.jpg" alt="20130208-164500.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>I still need to install the backsplash, install the ductwork for the ventilation hood, modify the kettles and install the electric heating elements and plumbing in the kettles and do some other minor work. I hope to get all that done this weekend and then after the plumber finishes the plumbing, I’ll be ready to brew!</p>

          </h3>
            <p>The homebrew club I’m in collectively had 6 years of Abyss bottles so we did a vertical tasting tonight. We had years 2007 through 2012, every year they made it except 2006. Our 2009 was also one of the <a href="http://www.thebrewsite.com/deschutes-has-brett-in-some-beer/">famously Brettanomyces-infected</a> bottles. </p>

<p>All were great, of course, but I liked 2010 and 2011 the best. They still had the distinct coffee and chocolate tastes I love in Russian Imperial Stouts. The flavors in the older ones were more blended together and the 2012 hadn’t developed enough. And I really liked the Brett 2009, it was very unique but not nearly as sour as a typical sour beer. They should make a Brett Abyss on purpose!  </p>
