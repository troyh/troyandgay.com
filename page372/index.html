            <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/letour2003.gif" alt="letour2003.gif" />I’m getting excited about the <a href="http://www.letour.fr/indexus.html">Tour de France</a> that starts this weekend. Lance Armstrong is being <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=ap-tour-armstrong&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns">his usual modest self</a> and <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-dc&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns">trying to stay calm</a>. I think <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-toursimoni_sports_feature&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns">Simoni</a> is his biggest threat, but <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-tourullrich_sports_feature&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns">Ullrich</a> may be closer to his top form of ‘97 (which was amazing) and <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-tourbotero_sports_feature&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns">Botero</a> will be interesting to watch. Last  year, I thought he had it sewn up from the start, but I have a feeling this year could be more difficult.</p>

            <p>Call me dumb, but I just came to a realization as to why the Mac is so much easier to use than Windows. It’s simply business. Any businessperson can tell you that you build your product to meet your customers’ needs. The customer for Windows is not the consumer, it’s <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?search=OEM&amp;go=Go">OEM</a>s. Microsoft sells very few copies of Windows on store shelves, the overwhelming majority of revenue comes from those who ship Windows on their computers – OEMs like Dell, Compaq, Gateway, etc. However, the customer for the Mac <strong>is</strong> the consumer because Apple doesn’t have OEMs, they have to build their product to appeal to the consumer. So that’s why you see an incredible number of features and customization in Windows that OEMs want/need (but that consumers don’t need or want) that get in the way, but the Mac is designed so suit the consumer.</p>

<p>It seems so obvious, but in all my years in the industry, I’ve never seen anyone put it this way. As a former Microsoft employee, I don’t even think that the employees realize this. The natural assumption is that Microsoft is just very bad at design and Apple is very good at it. I still think that’s true, but it’s true because Microsoft has no need to be good at design – the OEMs aren’t complaining about poor design.</p>

The quality of iChat + iSight is stunning. I’ve done video conferences with people on high-end equipment before and this is far better both in sound and picture quality. The video quality still isn’t TV quality, but it is close and does 30 frames per second (which is what TV does). I have seen the future of telecommunication and this is it.</p>

<p>Now I just wish I knew more people with Macs to chat with. <img src="/img/smile.gif" alt="" /></p>

            <p>My <a href="http://apple.com/isight">iSight</a> arrived today. It’s classic great Apple packaging and most of it is well-designed. But the mounting system(s) is terrible design. To assemble/disassemble it from the mounting base, it comes apart in five pieces. It’s all designed to make it look good when it’s mounted, but surely they could’ve come up with a better design.</p>

<p>The mounting situation is horrible for anyone without a laptop. The only mount to mount it on the back of a flat panel display has a sticky base so it’s more or less permanent. Not a good idea. And the Apple displays are curved in the back no there’s no flat surface to mount the base properly. But zip ties to the rescue… I mounted it like <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dayman/isight.jpg">this guy</a> did. Not pretty, but it works until Apple or a 3rd party comes out with a better mount.</p>

<p>iChat AV is buggy still too.</p>
