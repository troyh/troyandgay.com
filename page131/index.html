<p>Republicans in the Senate rejected the auto bailout because they want the union to agree to allow the companies to pay competitive salaries. But the Governor of Michigan “doesn’t know why the auto companies are failing”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/13/business/13uaw.html?_r=1&amp;hp:</p>

<p>bq. Washington gave a bailout to the financial institutions, and did not ask a single question, the governor said, “then lay the blame for the auto industry, which is a victim of this financial meltdown, on the backs of the people who are working on the line.”</p>

<p>Helping the Wall Street financial firms amounts to handing them cash because their product is cash. If the government could hand GM, Ford and Chrysler cars or even designs for really good cars, a bailout would make some sense.</p>

<p>The auto industry is not a victim of the financial meltdown. If they were, then Honda, Toyota, BMW and Daimler would also be on the verge of collapse and begging for money from their governments. Well-run companies can handle economic downturns and drops in sales. Poorly-run companies don’t anticipate them, prepare for them or survive them without help.</p>

        <article>
          <p>After an 8-year hiatus, Red Hook has started making their Double Black Stout again. When I lived in Virginia and visited Seattle in 1996 I went to a grocery store to bring some good beers home. This is one that I found. It’s an Imperial Stout with coffee. Back then, it proudly claimed that they used the local Starbucks coffee. Now it doesn’t, so I assume that either Starbucks’ name doesn’t offer the same cachet or uniqueness or, more likely, that it’s not Starbucks coffee. Either way, this is a great beer. It reminds me of Deschutes’ “The Abyss”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/29/deschutes-brewerys-the-abyss/ and “Stone Imperial Russian Stout”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/07/03/stone-imperial-russian-stout/. The bitterness seems to come solely from the coffee and it has a nice roasty taste. It has a “B+ on BeerAdvocate”:http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1330/55 and a “3.75”:http://ratebeer.com/beer/redhook-double-black-stout/665/ out of 5.0 on RateBeer.</p>

<p>Even better, I shared a little with Gay while we watched “The Dark Knight”:http://thedarkknight.warnerbros.com/dvdsite/ last night. It was a pretty good night. :)</p>

          <p>This was a surprise. Gay found it our grocery store and thought of me. It’s a Belgian Stout (I’ve never heard of such a thing) made with Belgian chocolate. It’s not as cake-like as Old Rasputin or Stone’s “Russian Imperial”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/07/03/stone-imperial-russian-stout/ and it’s very slightly sour, but has a nice chocolate flavor and a slight bitterness. I could drink several of these in a row, which is not usually true for me and stouts.</p>

<p>“Official site”:http://www.ommegang.com/index.php?mcat=1&amp;scat=7&amp;ssnl=1. It’s only rated a “B+ on BeerAdvocate”:http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/42/38818 and a “3.6 on RateBeer”:http://ratebeer.com/beer/ommegang-chocolate-indulgence/75815/. I’d give it an A- and at least a 4.0.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>The WSJ has “a good article on real estate prices”:http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122764977315457619.html and includes three gems that show how Americans make bad decisions when investing:</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>bq. In a poll of 2,000 adults, real-estate-data provider Zillow.com found that 61% believed the value of their home would either remain level or rise over the next six months.</p>

<p>6 months! Americans are nothing if not optimistic. Housing prices have fallen every year for the last few years, 10% in the last year alone. But 61% of those surveyed believe that the next 6 months will reverse all of that. What are they thinking will ignite a surge in home prices? Houses, like all things, are priced by supply and demand. Right now, there is excess supply and very little demand so prices will continue to fall until they reach a point where they are so low that demand picks up. That’s not likely to happen by May 2009.</p>

<p>bq. Another survey of more than 1,000 homeowners, sponsored by real-estate-services firm Realogy Corp., found that 91% thought that owning a home was the best long-term investment they could make.</p>

<p>Real estate values are not great investments, especially not long-term investments. A house is a wise purchase because you have to have a roof over your head and putting money into something that you own and can even grow and beat inflation is better than throwing it away in rent. Plus, the tax breaks make owning even cheaper. Real estate is relatively safe, but not a great investment (and not without risk).</p>

<p>bq. And an online survey of 5,000 people commissioned by Citigroup found that just 32% believed it was a good time to invest in stocks – but 51% said it was a good time to buy a home.</p>

<p>Stocks are still the best long-term investment. Real estate barely beats inflation (2.5%) but stocks average 10% or more per year. People don’t believe that because they invest emotionally. People seem to think that buying stock when the prices are low is dumb, yet they flock to Wal-mart to get low prices on everything but their investments. Do people think that if you buy stock in a bear market that they’re getting lower-quality stock that is less likely to rise? It’s very weird.</p>
