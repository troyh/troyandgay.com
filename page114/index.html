              <p>Cancellara cracked on the first mountain climb of the tour, not able to keep up with Astana driving the peloton. Contador attacked his own team, supposedly against the team’s plan, and leapt ahead of Lance by 2 seconds.</p>

              <p>Back from her vacation, <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/06/29/our-architect/">our architect</a> came over today to look at the property and talk about our options for locating the house. It doesn’t seem practical to move the house very far north and retain the view due to the slope of the property. But we still may be able to situate it so that we have one yard instead of a front and a back yard. Gay and I don’t quite agree on the importance of this, though. The architect will have to be creative to mediate between us on this and still give us south-facing windows for good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_solar_building_design">solar glazing</a>.</p>

              <p>The Roku (pronounced “Row-koo”, not “Rock You”, I’ve discovered) player <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/06/03/roku-netflix-player/">we got 13 months ago</a>, one month past the 1-year warranty, died last Friday. They wouldn’t replace it so I ordered a replacement. Good thing they’re only $100. I tested the power supply and it was delivering the correct voltage so I assumed it was the box itself. I was wrong.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.roku.com/Images/netflixplayer/home_content_box.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I got the new one today and tried the new power supply and it does work. Hmmm. Maybe the amperage is wrong? I can’t test that. Well, with a replacement power supply, we will have two and can use the old one elsewhere. It’s a great device, otherwise.</p>

              <p>Today was the team time trial and, as expected, Astana won by 40 seconds, exactly the time difference between Armstrong and Cancellara. So they have the same time starting Stage 5 but Cancellara is still in yellow by a few hundredths of a second. Four of the top 5 positions in the race are Astana riders. I’ve never seen a team so dominant. It’d be amazing to see all three podium finishers from the same team, I don’t think that’s ever been done before.</p>

<p>Ben Stiller is now <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/36958130.html">hanging around Lance</a> and was allowed to be a podium girl and put the yellow jersey on Cancellara after the stage.</p>

              <p>The Tour is already exciting. It’s usually boring the first week but today Lance Armstrong got into a breakaway just 30km before the finish and gained 40 seconds on the other big contenders for the victory, including his teammate and favored winner, Alberto Contador. He’s ahead of him by 19 seconds.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is the team time trial which their team, Astana, is expected to win. If they do and beat team Saxo-Bank by 40+ seconds Lance will be in yellow tomorrow. And the tensions between him and Contador should be interesting.</p>
