          <p>We had an appointment today on Bainbridge Island so we drove up and had lunch at the marina. It’s been years since I’ve been to Bainbridge and it’s still a cute as ever. I wish Vashon had a downtown area as nice as Bainbridge’s but with half the population of Bainbridge, I don’t think Vashon can sustain it.</p>

<p>Our appointment ran longer than expected so we just missed the ferry from Bainbridge to Seattle so we raced back down the peninsula and were the last car on the Southworth ferry back to Vashon. Phew!</p>

          <p>I’ve had these beers over the last few days:</p>

<p>Dogfish Head Aprihop: rating=3/5, didn’t think I’d like it, but I did.
Great Divide Hercules Double IPA: rating=4/5
Skagit River Trumpeter Imperial Stout: rating=4/5
Port Brewing’s The Lost Abbey Angel’s Share: rating=4/5
Stone Cali-Belgique: rating=3/5
Fuller’s London Porter: rating=4/5</p>

<p>I hadn’t had London Porter in many years and it’s hard to find, so when I found it, I picked up two (cans). It’s just as I remember it, very malty, somewhat bitter and nicely sweet.</p>

<p>Angel’s Share is another big-hyped beer lately and I’ve been waiting to find it. It just arrived in Seattle this week so when I found it I had to get it. On Saturday we finally got Quantum of Solace from Netflix so we shared it while watching the movie, which seemed like a great night. Both the movie and the beer were disappointing. I can’t get over the complete lack of carbonation in the beer, although otherwise it’s wonderful.</p>

          <p>She’s getting tall enough to ride her tricycle, but her legs are just a tad too short to reach the pedal at its furthest point. She can now turn the pedals several turns but if she doesn’t give enough push on the downward stroke the pedal doesn’t get all the way around. And she doesn’t quite have the hang of turning the wheel to steer yet.</p>

<p>She sings a song that goes “Pedals and wheels, pedals and wheels” as she rides it. I don’t know if that’s a made-up song or something she heard somewhere.</p>

          <p>Today is the first sunny day, so Havana got to hunt for Easter eggs today instead of on Sunday.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3445247177/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3648/3445247177_16104d6996.jpg" alt="IMG_3580" /></a></p>

<p>When she woke up from her noon nap, Kelly told her that the Easter bunny came and she asked “Did he hide the eggs?” How does she know that?</p>

<p>She found all the eggs and immediately opened each plastic one as she found them to get the Jelly Belly inside.</p>

          <p>We had an appointment in Seattle this afternoon so we asked Kelly to stay late and we made it into a date night. After our appointment, we went up to Wallingford to <a href="http://bottleworksbeerstore.blogspot.com/">BottleWorks</a> to stock up on some new beers and then to their beer restaurant in Fremont, <a href="http://www.brouwerscafe.com/bier.html">Brouwer’s Cafe</a>, for dinner.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3445564596/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3581/3445564596_7b2589d812.jpg" alt="IMG_4769" /></a></p>

<p>Brouwer’s Cafe has been around for a while now but I didn’t even know about until about 6 months ago. It’s in a very cool space and has several fridges of bottled beers behind the bar and 60 taps of draft beer. It took 20 minutes after we got there, and 10 minutes after we ordered, to get our first beers and the place wasn’t even crowded – maybe 20 people in the place with 5 or 6 staffers. The wait staff are all tattooed death-metal types who don’t seem to like people (read: me when I was 17 without minus the tattoos). The food is “Belgian inspired” and not bad, but not great. I had the lamb burger which was surprisingly spicy, a little too spicy, and Gay had the Croque Monsieur.</p>

<p>In spite of their big draft beer selection, nothing really stuck out as need-to-try beers. I ended up with Stone’s Arrogant Bastard, which isn’t hard to find in bottles, but I’d never had it on tap. Gay got the local Maritime’s Dry-hopped IPA. My second beer was <a href="http://www.averybrewing.com/">Avery</a>’s Maharaja IPA, which is a wonderful Imperial IPA and one that I discovered recently in the bottle on our trip to Oregon. Avery is one of my new favorite breweries.</p>

<p>We didn’t want to get home at 7pm on our date night so we decided to stop at Beveridge Place Pub which is not far from the ferry. I had the delicious Rogue Old Crustacean barley wine (I’ve been into barley wines lately, a beer I’ve always disliked) and Gay had the Full Sail Imperial Porter. A quick stop at Starbucks for coffees and we were on our way to catch the 8:45 ferry.</p>
