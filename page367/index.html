              <p>After stopping at the bakery downtown for coffee and a muffin, we took the dogs down to Lisabeulah park on the west side of the island and Ouzo got to go swimming for his 2nd time. Illy still only wades in the water and never strays too far away from us, but Ouzo just couldn’t get enough of the water.</p>

<p>A couple kayakers from Seattle stopped for a break there too on their 2-day trip around the island (30 miles of kayaking!). As usual, they ask us what we do for a living that we can live on Vashon and everyone has the same look when we say “We run a recipe web site” and you can just see the question they’re dying to ask but never do: “And what do you do with the other 23 hours a day?”</p>

              <p>Browsing some new RSS feeds, I come across one of my favorite columns ever: The Straight Dope. And I find that my understanding of “passive-aggressive” is wrong. Cecil <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/030530.html">says</a> it applies to people who are just lazy. This makes no sense to me. I’ve always thought it meant someone who tries to get their way (acts aggressively) but does so without being overtly aggressive (passive).</p>

<p>Here’s two cases of what I would call “passive-aggressive” behavior that I’ve experienced. What are these called if not passive-aggressive?</p>

<p>1.) Our neighbor once walked up to us and asked “Do you feed your dogs? If you don’t feed them, I’d be happy to continue to feed them for you.”  She discovered that one of our dogs would eat food when offered (have you ever seen a dog say “No thanks, I’m really stuffed”?) and/or ate her cat’s food that was left outside all day.</p>

<p>2.) At a restaurant <a href="http://www.whistler-blackcomb.com/">Whistler</a> in Canada, after two shockingly bad attempts at making a <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/search/getrecipe.zsp?id=8877&amp;path=">Manhattan</a>, the waiter brought the ingredients to our table and asked Gay if she would like to make her own Manhattan.</p>

The U.S. is just 227 years old (11 generations of people) and we’ve already forgotten one of the biggest problems  the creation of the U.S. solved. Stunning. Americans really do have a short attention span and absolutely no sense of history.</p>
