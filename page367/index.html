            <p>Since the week is filled with work on <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a>, we spent the entire weekend hammering out lots of code for (yet) another web site. It was hot this weekend too and we sat in the office in front of our computers, which got to be uncomfortable. But we made lots of progress at least. We didn’t quite finish it, which was our goal for the weekend, but we’re close. And the coolest thing is although the site is very different from <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a>, a lot of the software can (and will) be used for Recipezaar.</p>

Lance leads Ullrich by 15 seconds and Vinokourov by 18 seconds. If nothing happens tomorrow, the race will come down to the final stage, another time trial. And given that Ullrich crushed Lance by 1:36 in the first time trial, that’s not good for Lance.</p>

            <p>Today’s award for good use of internet: <a href="http://www.codeasart.com/poetry/darwin.html">The Darwinian Poetry site</a>.  In an experiment, this guy has taken 1,000 random words and creates random poems out of them.  You vote between two which poem is better, and he slices the better poem with a new one to make a superior poem.  It will take a hundred of us monkies to see if the computer can eventually create a good poem.  So far the only measurable result is that poems with the word “ship” in them do better.</p>

            <p>Ullrich beat Lance in the individual time trial  yesterday by <strong>1 minute 36 seconds</strong>. That’s a very wide margin to put into one of the best time trialists in the world especially for someone who has been out of racing for the last couple years. Ullrich moved up to #2 (Tyler Hamilton moved up to #4) behind Lance just 34 seconds back. The mountains this weekend are going to be very interesting.</p>
