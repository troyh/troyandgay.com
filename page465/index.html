            <p>The clocks jumped back an hour today. Today is an hour longer, but for the next six months, it’ll be darker earlier in the evening. No more waiting til 4pm to go bike riding.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>On Wednesday we went to Shoreline Community College for <em>free</em> dental work. They took my blood pressure and, of course, it was high (152/67) due to my nervousness at 1) being in a medical environment and 2) having my blood pressure checked. So I’ve started taking it myself again in a more relaxed environment. It was 131/72 which is still a little high, but still normal. More weight loss and exercise should help.</p>

            <p>Idiots in Congress (some heavily funded by good ‘ol ) “decided” that <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/linux/0,1411,55989,00.html">the US Govt should not fund any software projects that result in GPL code</a>. But <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/archives/2002_10.shtml#000586">Lawrence Lessig</a> correctly explains the absurdity: <em>Giving up proprietary control is the price GPLd code demands, just as all-the-money-in-the-world is the price  would demand for similar access to its OS source. Some can pay that price; some cannot.</em></p>

            <p>May be wishful thinking on my part too, but I sure have seen very similar stuff.
