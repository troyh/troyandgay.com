          <p><a href="http://www.crn.com/weblogs/stevegillmor/2003/07/28/28.asp#43577">Steve Gillmour (no relation) contemplates that if email and web browsing developed rich client apps over time so will RSS</a>.  This couldn’t be more wrong.  Ignoring the fact that e-mail started as a main frame app so of course it was all terminal emulation, client apps are only useful for creation (word, photoshop).  Email is essentially a creator and file system.  <em>This</em> is why we have developed a rich client app, and my guess is that over time web-based <em>will</em> evolve to be good enough (heck it is for most people according to the number of hotmail and yahoo addresses in my book).  RSS is really just content.  It is just stuff to read.  There is absolutely no need for a client solution except for the “read on the plane” offline case*.  My guess is that widely available wi-fi will solve this before a offline clients are common for this purpose.  Client apps are inherently poor net-citizens with their constant polling, and redundant downloading.  Disk caching helps browsing, but proxy servers are even better.  Why require each user to cache when a central server could do it better.</p>

          <p>I’m irritated that the seven words (or however many there were) are quickly being forgotten.  Please let’s not forget that we were led into this war under suspicious circumstances, we are not accomplishing our goals there, and Americans are dying.  An interesting analysis piece in Slate argues that <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2086636/">we do not have 1/4 of the troops necessary to successfully restore Iraq</a>.</p>

<p><em>“The highest levels of casualties have occurred in the operations with the lowest levels of U.S. troops.” In fact, he adds, “Only when the number of stabilization troops has been low in comparison to the population”such as in Somalia, Afghanistan, and now Iraq”have U.S. forces suffered or inflicted significant casualties.” By contrast, in Germany, Japan, Bosnia, and Kosovowhere troop levels were highAmericans suffered no postwar combat deaths.</em></p>

          <p>It’s fun to build something and release it for the world to try. And tonight I found the <a href="http://www.librarystuff.net/new_archives/000618.html">1st review</a> of <a href="http://mywireservice.com">MyWireService</a>. Pretty good. Yes, we do need more feeds. But I always love when people notice performance, cuz it’s hard to do (and we haven’t really concentrated on performance much yet).</p>
