            <p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/09/08/bush.speech/index.html">Bush wants $87 billion more dollars</a> to finish the job in Iraq and at the end of the day, should easily tally $100 billion (really makes our tax cut this year seem silly). The Gulf War of 1991 <a href="http://www.the-week.com/23mar09/events9.htm">cost the US only $7 billion</a>. Why? Because other nations involved helped pay off the total cost of $61 billion. And W even told us several times that Iraq’s oil would help rebuild the country. Where’s that money?</p>

<p>Of W, Cheney &amp; Powell, only W is the different player in this Iraq war. So it makes sense to start pointing fingers, doesn’t it? And remember, W originally wanted no help at all, not even from the UN. Now he’s calling for other nations and the UN to help. “Hey, we did the easy work and made fun of you for not helping, can you guys come help us with the hard work now?”</p>

<p>If you recall, the original point for the Iraq war was because of Weapons of Mass Destruction. Now it’s about terrorism and that Iraq was the center of the planning for 9/11. That’s even less correct than the WMD claim, so in 6-12 months Bush will certainly back off those claims too, right? I wonder what the rationale will be then, that Iraq is responsible for high  unemployment in the US? And I wonder how  many Americans will still listen to a word he says.</p>

<p>Does he realize he’s running a country, risking lives, making (bad) history and that this isn’t just a game of cops &amp; robbers? Does anybody think he knows what he’s doing? Can’t we fire this guy yet?</p>

            <p>Old news, but I just found out that my college got its second <a href="http://www.nobel.se/economics/laureates/index.html">Nobel Prize for Economics</a>, awarded to <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/facultybios/smith.html">Vernon L. Smith</a>. <a href="http://www.gmu.edu">George Mason University</a> is the only university in Virginia to have two Nobel prize winners. I’m surprised that neither <a href="http://virginia.edu">University of Virginia</a> nor <a href="http://www.vt.edu">Virginia Tech</a> have two Nobel Prize winners. The school now has 27,500 students (!), the average GPA for enrolled students is 3.3 and the average SAT is 1120; I could barely still get accepted. Can you tell I just got my Alumni newsletter?</p>

            <p>Since moving to the west coast, I’ve completely dropped off the face of the football world. Maybe if the <a href="http://seahawks.com">Seahawks</a> weren’t so bad, I would’ve kept up-to-date on football. But what I really wanted was to watch the <a href="http://steelers.com">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> games again. So this year, I subscribed to DirecTV’s <a href="http://ww2.nfl.com/ticket/">NFL Sunday Ticket</a> so I can watch any football game I want on Sunday, which means I get to see the same broadcast that people in Pittsburgh get and can follow the Steelers this year. And they won by <a href="http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/recap/NFL_20030907_BAL@PIT">squashing the Ravens</a>, 34-15 (and it wasn’t even that close). One great thing about football on the west coast is that the games start at 10am and 1pm, not 1pm and 4pm. This means that even the late game is over at 4pm and you still have hours left before the evening hours. On the downside, it’s not as much fun to eat nachos at 10am.</p>
