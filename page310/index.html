            <p>I get a kick out of IBM’s and HP’s reports of Linux revenue mostly because (short-sighted) people laughed when I said Linux will be a huge business years ago (“Linux is a fad”, “Linux is for 16-year old geeks”). Yesterday, HP announced <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/01/15/HNhplinuxrevenue_1.html?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/01/15/HNhplinuxrevenue_1.html">they earned $2.5 billion</a> (that’s a ‘b’) last year in Linux revenue, a 40% increase over the previous year. Amazing how much money something that is free can bring in.</p>

<p>To put the $2.5 billion into perspective, the only real challenger to Linux where Linux is currently dominating (the server market) is Microsoft. Microsoft in fiscal 2003 earned $6.5 billion in their “Server and Tools” group which includes all their server products (SQL Server, Windows Server, BackOffice, etc.). Let’s assume that Windows Server is 50% (of all server products), Microsoft only made $3.25 billion, or only 30% more than HP alone made. If you factor in all the other companies profiting from Linux (IBM, Red Hat, Novell, etc.), it’s pretty clear that the market for Linux has already eclipsed its #1 threat. And it did it in 2-3 years, whereas Windows Server has been in the market for 12 years. The trend should be obvious.</p>

<p>Speaking of Microsoft, they <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/040115/na_fin_us_microsoft_antitrust_2.html">continue to break the laws</a> that they were convicted of breaking and for which they were never punished. When is the government going to stop trusting this company and take some action to discourage law-breaking? It’s like catching a bank-robber and forcing them to apologize but not force them to give the money back and send them on their merry way.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.moveon.org">MoveOn.org</a> (an organization founded by average folks in response to frustration with Bill Clinton’s impeachment hearings, the lack of congressional resolution, and a desire to get the country focused on real problems) sponsored an amateur video contest:  Make a thirty second spot that best explains what the president’s policies are really all about, not just those lame voice over commercials you usually see in political campaigns.  It is a brilliant idea, and the <a href="http://www.bushin30seconds.org/index.html">Bush in 30 seconds</a> winner is great.  They are now raising money to get the spot played on CNN during the State of the Union address coverage and during the Superbowl – though so far <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/sports/2357653">CBS says the ad doesn’t pass their Standards and Practices committee</a>, huh?!  They allow White House ads, ads against smoking, other political ads.  PLEASE!</p>

<p>I believe this kind of free political expression is precisely what our country is founded on.  <a href="http://www.moveonvoterfund.org/donate/creditcard.html">We gave to the cause, and encourage you to do so too</a>, if you believe in freedom of speech and would like to see a political ad truly made by the people instead of boring ads made by big dumb political action committees or parties.</p>
