<blockquote>“Middle-aged people — like me — often look back on our teenage selves with some mixture of amusement and chagrin,” said one of the authors, Daniel T. Gilbert, a psychologist at Harvard. “What we never seem to realize is that our future selves will look back and think the very same thing about us. At every age we think we’re having the last laugh, and at every age we’re wrong.”</blockquote>

              <p>Gay and I went to <a href="http://www.fremontbrewing.com/">Fremont Brewing</a>’s new taproom for (imperial) beers this afternoon. It’s a great new taproom, much better than the old one, with several beers only available at the taproom. Dark Star Imperial Oatmeal Stout:</p>

              <p>I’ve increased my workouts this week by 50% and had a tough one this morning after just 4 hours of sleep. After 15 minutes, I bonked so I ate a handful of dried blueberries for energy. It helped, but I ended up stopping 3 more times to rest. It took me 2 hours to do a 1-hour workout. After showering, I made myself a grilled peanut butter and strawberry jelly sandwich, poured myself a homebrew and sat down to relax and read. I feel much better.  </p>

<blockquote>
ON DECEMBER 14th maniacs in America and China unleashed the horror in their heads on the most innocent of targets. In China’s Henan province, Min Yongjun burst into a classroom and hacked away at 23 children, severing ears and fingers. But in Newtown, Connecticut, the little ones suffered even worse. After a ten-minute rampage 20 of them were dead, as were six teachers and the killer himself. The American was armed with a semi-automatic rifle with an extended magazine and two semi-automatic handguns. Every country has its madmen, but Min was armed only with a knife, so none of his victims died.

If America is ever to confront its obsession with guns, that time is now. America’s murder rate is four times higher than Britain’s and six times higher than Germany’s. Only an idiot, or an anti-American bigot prepared to maintain that Americans are four times more murderous than Britons, could possibly pretend that no connection exists between those figures and the fact that 300m guns are “out there” in the United States, more than one for every adult.</blockquote>
