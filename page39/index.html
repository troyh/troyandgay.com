  <li>
    <p>I’m thankful that I spend morning, noon and night with Gay every day and yet I want to spend more time with her. I’m thankful for her and for her willingness to be in my life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My kids who teach me over and over how much I love being alive. They also teach me over and over that I must continually improve myself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our house. For the first time in my life, I feel like I live in a home. And I’m thankful that I got to be so involved in its renovation and had so much fun doing it working with great people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Pacific Northwest. I am thankful that I get to live in one of the most beautiful, and reasonably-populated, places in the world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am thankful that I had the opportunity to pursue my life’s dreams and to shape my life the way I wanted to. And even more thankful that I still have that freedom.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m healthy; I’m thankful for the knowledge that one day I won’t be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beer. It’s the icing on the cake for me and I (usually) don’t drink as much of it as I’d like to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Programming. It’s exercise for my brain that I’ve enjoyed for a lifetime. I feel like a kid when I get to write code and solve new little problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My home gym. I wouldn’t exercise if it weren’t for convenient access to exercise equipment. It’s my daily addiction. And I’m thankful specifically for the specific equipment I have that makes exercise fun.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My doctors at PacMed. My life today (and tomorrow) is better because of them.</p>
  </li>

          <p>Eva is 11 months old today. She’s still a great baby, only cries when she’s hungry or frustrated. She sleeps well and very regularly. And she eats very well — she loves eggs and has no nut allergies.</p>

<p>She’s not yet walking on her own but she uses a walker really well in straight lines. She still crawls very quickly amd loves getting around the house. She says “Maaa maaaa” now and laughs all the time.</p>

<p>Hudson and Havana are good baby-sitters too, warning us when she gets near the stairs and blocking her. Hudson really seems to like her; he sits with her and plays with her, hugs her, etc.</p>

          <p>Fall is my favorite time of year: temperatures are a little cooler, you can smell fireplaces in the air, the leaves turn colors, the best beers of the year start coming out, Halloween, my birthday and my favorite holiday (Thanksgiving) arrives, football is on, and it’s lighter in the morning and darker earlier and the light just feels better to me.</p>

<p>I took this photo while out walking around the neighborhood. I wish I took a photo of the red leaves up ahead, they were so bright red on one side and pink on the other, it looked like Valentine’s Day. Havana would’ve loved it.</p>

          <p>Today I’m at the meaningful age of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)">42</a>. I’m officially not young any more. Looking back, I was a kid being pulled by a fire inside trying my best with my limited abilities and somehow ended up having a fun, lucky and very fortunate life…</p>

<blockquote>

&gt; 
&gt; I want to dance with this fire
Because it's all that I know
As the spotlight turns towards me
I just try my best to show
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; We are lost
We are freaks
We are crippled
We are weak
We are the heirs
To all the world
&gt; 
&gt; </blockquote>

<p>Looking forward, I want to build a new fire and show my kids and help them build theirs. </p>

<blockquote>

&gt; 
&gt; Let's go
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; Build a fire
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; Down on the empty beach where the waves are crashing high
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; White heat, purify as the sparks fly up into the great black sky
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; Sacrifice these crutches to the crackling flame
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; Stand as silhouettes against the dawn
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; It's far too late to try to sleep now
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; It seems I'm never tired anymore

<p>This old song from my youth always seemed so relevant to me. It inspired me then and still seems to.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Now that we have kids and live in a neighborhood that does trick-or-treating, we’re starting a tradition of decorating the house. Our street doesn’t go as all-out as 16th and 17th Avenues do here, but most houses decorate significantly. Since our house was built by the guy who created Rainier Beer, we thought it’d be fitting to make it into a haunted brewery.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/6302601273/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6040/6302601273_361a3ba3f9.jpg" alt="Happy Halloween!" /></a></p>

<p>We also wanted to make it fun for parents too, so we’ll have a keg and pour beers for parents who have to walk around watching their kids get all the treats.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>We didn’t have many props this year, but I thought the famous Rainier R would be appropriate. It turns out that no kids knew what it was for, but all the older people sure did. It didn’t dawn on me that anyone under the age of 12 or so never saw <a href="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/50291_250186381337_6405329_n.jpg">the R on top of the Rainier brewery</a> since it was bought by Tully’s Coffee and <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Rainier_Brewery_04A.jpg/220px-Rainier_Brewery_04A.jpg">replaced with a T</a>. We’ll need to do more next year to make it more brewery-like. I also made the R flicker, as if the electricity was not working properly. I used a modified dimmer controlled by a photocell triggered by a flame light bulb, copied from <a href="http://www.hauntedillinois.com/lightflicker.php">this site</a>.</p>

<p>Megan and Jon came over to help us give out candy, drink and serve beers. Gay and I took the kids up and down the street for their trick-or-treating while Megan and Jon manned the beer and were around while Eva went to bed for the night. Havana dressed as a unicorn and Hudson dressed as a stegosaurus. Gay and I dressed as brewery workers with coveralls and Rainier Beer patches sewn on. Hudson and Havana stayed up later than normal and also helped give out candy to the older kids coming to the door.</p>

<p>We only got a pony keg, thinking we wouldn’t get many drinkers, but we almost finished it. We got some dry ice for the keg hoping that it’d give off a smoke to look like a cauldron or something, but the effect didn’t quite work. We also stupidly dumped the dry ice on top of the keg and 10 minutes later the tap was frozen so we couldn’t pour any beer. It took us 15 minutes to thaw it out. I estimate we poured 40 beers and some people came back two and three times for refills. A couple people assumed it was Rainier Beer and politely refused until they realized it was Manny’s Pale Ale.</p>

<p>We had lots of kids and gave out almost all our candy to at least 9:30pm. Some neighbors came by just for the beer too. It was pretty fun and we’re already looking forward to doing it again next year.</p>
