        <article>
          <p>MSFT ass-kiss Paul Andrews makes the bold prediction that <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/134614233_paul13.html"> Microsoft’s monopoly is over (well, eroding for the next 10 years)</a>.  He says Linux is cheaper, open source is better, the anti-monopoly backlash is helping, and  itself is contributing to its own failure (“the company moves with elephantine deliberation”).</p>

<p>_ At a recent briefing, a senior Microsoft executive derided open source as a “collection of clones.” The irony appeared to be lost on him. _</p>

          <p>One of my <a href="http://fumweb/MT/archives/001153.html#001153">2003 predictions</a> has already been determined:  #6. Apple will ship Chimera as their own browser.</p>

<p>I wasn’t 100% right, but I was close… they announced Safari which is their own browser but it’s not Chimera, it’s built around KHTML and not Mozilla. Surprising.</p>

<a href="http://linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6565">Doc Searls on Safari’s open-sourceness</a>: <em>The larger issue for everybody is standards. Among the geeks I talked to at the show there was complete agreement that Safari’s open-source code base created a new de facto condition that favors de jure standards. One Apple engineer explained, “Until Tuesday, the de facto standard was IE. That’s what developers cared about, and that’s what webmasters cared about. Not any more. Now everybody’s going to be holding every browser’s feet to the standard’s fire. If you fork the standards, you fork yourself.” Adds James Davidson, “It’s no longer game-over for web standards interoperability. You’d better adhere to standards now.”</em></p>
