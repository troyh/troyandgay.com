        <article>
          <p>When we got to the airport we learned that the flight was delayed an hour because the plane was late due to weather leaving London. We checked-in, went to the British Airways lounge and waited with complimentary water, a beer and a glass of wine and really good mini sandwiches. During pre-boarding we went down to the gate to pack up the stroller, which will make you break a sweat. We thought we’d have to check the stroller into the cargo hold, but they let us take it on board and stash it in a closet.</p>

<p>We sat on the plane for another hour because some nitwit in SeaTac’s baggage department loaded baggage from a different flight on our plane, so they had to unload our plane to take the extra baggage off. The plane was ultimately 2.5 hours late.</p>

<p>This was the best flight I’ve ever been on! For starters, the question “Would you like some champagne, sir?” is the best thing I can hear when I’m about to take off on an airplane. We were in Club World, BA’s business class, so we had <a href="http://www.britishairways.com/travel/cwonboard/public/en_gb">lie-flat seats</a> and Gay, Havana and Hudson essentially had their own little room – I was on the other side of the wall. For the first time in my life, I slept on a plane. After dinner and a really stupid movie, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0901476/">Bride Wars</a>, I was tired so I made the bad flat and tried to go to sleep. I woke up and thought that I got an hour of sleep at the most, but the the pilot announced that we’d be landing in London in an hour. An hour?! I must’ve slept for 4 hours. On a plane. I never thought it’d happen.</p>

<p>Hudson got a baby seat that mounted on a tray on the wall behind us and right after take-off, Gay put him in it and he immediately went to sleep. Havana was excited and tried really hard to stay awake, but eventually she fell asleep too and slept almost the entire flight.</p>

<p>Before we landed, we had breakfast (cereal, fruit, yogurt and croissant) and coffee.</p>

<p>Thanks to BA letting us carry the stroller on board with us, it meant we’d have it as soon as we got off the plane and before going through customs and baggage claim allowing us to wheel the kids around the airport. Of course, Havana preferred to walk the entire way from the gate through customs, baggage claim and to the <a href="https://www.heathrowexpress.com/index.asp?SID={07F90EA1-ACF9-456B-BB15-97C30549C49A}">Heathrow Express</a> terminal. Why do we have a double-stroller?</p>

<p>We took the train to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddington_station">Paddington Station</a> and took a taxi from there to our hotel in Mayfair. I’ve always loved the <a href="http://www.lti.co.uk/home.php">taxis in London</a> but was amazed to find that we could fit the un-folded stroller, 3 suitcases, a backpack and 4 people in it comfortably inside (no trunk space).</p>

<p>Statistics: This was Hudson’s first airplane ride and Havana’s 11th (!). Both Havana and Hudson had their first rides on a train and in a taxi. This is Hudson’s first trip outside the USA and Havana’s third. This is my 4th visit to London and Gay’s 3rd.</p>

          <p>Seeing women use usernames of “so-and-so’s_mommy” online has always driven me crazy.  Didn’t those women have a name and their own identities before kids?  Why do they need to advertise that their ovaries work?  Of course, I also don’t see a reason to adopt your husband’s name just because you got married either, but just taking a last name seems more feminist than losing your identity completely to your kid.  BTW, what do these women do when the second kid is born? Katie Rophe skewers these same women, <a href="http://www.doublex.com/section/life/get-your-kid-your-facebook-page">who put pictures of their kids instead of their own in their facebook profile</a>.</p>

<blockquote>"Facebook, of course, traffics in exhibitionism: it is a way of presenting your life, at least those sides of it you cherry pick for the outside world, for show. One's children are of course an important achievement, and arguably one's most important achievement, but that doesn't mean that they are who you are. "</blockquote>

<p>By the way, I believe that when you send the Christmas photo card, you should be in it too.  I am/was friends with <em>you</em>, not your kids.</p>

          <p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3335/3531238317_5eaf659279_m.jpg" alt="Gay on bridge" />I’m training to run the <a href="http://www.rnrseattle.com/">Seattle RocknRoll Marathon</a> June 27th with my friends Laura &amp; Megan.  It has been <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2006/04/17/recent-history-inn-at-langley-whidbey-marathon/">years since I ran</a> a <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2005/06/08/3091/">marathon</a>, so it is like starting over.  My first long run over 10 miles actually happened on our San Fransisco trip, when I ran along the waterfront and across the Golden Gate bridge and back.  I was surprised to learn the bridge is two miles long.  I love the bridge.  It is gorgeous architecturally, and the orange color makes it stand out against the city on the south side and the green rolling hills on the north. It is dorky to say, but crossing the bridge on foot was exhilarating.  One of the best running experiences of my life.  Tomorrow I am aiming for 19 miles.</p>

          <p>We picked up our repaired Mac Pro at the Apple Store (I love AppleCare!) and then went out to dinner tonight in Seattle. The food was disappointing and we had to listen the waiter tell us that he doesn’t believe in global warming and that he’s sick of the Spanish-speaking people in California.</p>

<p>After dinner and on the way home, we stopped at my favorite pub, Beveridge Place, for a beer so that I could attend one event during <a href="http://www.seattlebeerweek.com/">Seattle Beer Week</a>. There was a beer geek trivia contest going on that we played, but we did terrible. I thought I was a beer geek, but those questions were hard!</p>

Other things I learned:  half of the world’s asparagus is white – why is it so hard to find here then? – and each stalk keep growing after harvest.</p>
