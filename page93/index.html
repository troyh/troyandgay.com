            <p>I’m posting this from an airplane. This is the first time I’ve had Internet access on an airplane (and free, thanks to Google). Better still, Virgin America serves 21st Amendment’s delicious IPA:</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We met with Tom and Dan at their office for the first time <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/11/24/architects-meeting-4/">in a while</a>. There were some minor changes to the kitchen, garage and master bedroom and they scaled the main part of the house down to save on square footage. We saw the first elevations (side view, not just a floor plan) but, frankly, we weren’t wow-ed by it and we want to be. Granted, it’s hard to imagine what it would look like in 3D looking at a 2D drawing. It would be a good-looking house and probably look weird  to someone used to more traditional designs, but we want something that amazes us and we aren’t there yet.
<!-- more -->After the meeting we went to <a href="http://www.kokorasgreekgrill.com/">Kokoras</a>, a place I’ve wondered about because it’s Greek and I can’t find any good Greek food in Seattle. From the outside, it doesn’t look appealing so we’ve always decided against us. We decided to finally try it. We went inside and ordered take-out and then went across the street to Beveridge Place Pub, where they don’t serve food so encourage you to get take-out and bring it there.</p>

<p>We surprisingly ran into Heather and Larry, Kelly’s parents, there. We had a beer with them while watching the Alabama-Texas game while we waited for our food order. Later, I went to get the food and they went to meet another daughter of theirs to go to an art opening.</p>

<p>The food was good, even when served in take-out boxes. We noticed that it’s also very kid-friendly so we’ll have to go eat there sometime and try some other dishes with the kids.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Here are my highlights of the year…</p>

<p>January: Havana <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/01/31/surprise-start-to-potty-training/">started</a> potty-training. <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/01/20/president-obama/">Obama became President</a>. Havana’s probably had more success than Obama has, but Obama’s job is much more difficult and he, along with Bernanke, saved the world from an economic meltdown. So far, anyway. Good start to the year.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>February: <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/02/02/six-super-bowls/">The Steelers won the Super Bowl</a> (again). This was one of, if not the, greatest Super Bowls ever.</p>

<p>March: We took <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/03/20/seattle-to-portland/">a road trip to San Francisco</a> and back. San Francisco is always fun and it was nice to get the Lexus out of the garage and on the road.</p>

<p>April: Havana <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/04/12/havanas-potty-training-progress/">started to stop</a> wearing diapers and <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/04/30/happy-birthday-havana-2/">turned 2</a>.</p>

<p>May: Havana had <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/05/07/havanas-first-haircut/">her first haircut</a>. We <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/05/17/seattle-to-london/">went to Europe</a>, visiting London, Devon and Brussels. That was a great trip, one of the few vacations I’ve had where I wasn’t dying to come home. We did realize that city vacations are not great for young kids, though.</p>

<p>June: We returned to Seattle from Europe. Gay <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/06/27/seattle-rock-n-roll-marathon/">ran half of the Seattle Rock ‘n Roll marathon</a>. We <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/06/29/our-architect/">hired an architect</a> to design our new house.</p>

<p>July: We celebrated <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/07/31/5th-wedding-anniversary/">our 5th wedding anniversary</a>. We’ve been together for 11 years now, practically inseparable, which still amazes me.</p>

<p>August: <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/08/25/happy-birthday-hudson/">Hudson turned 1</a>. He’s so laid-back that he’s been a very easy baby, although he can still scream bloody murder when he’s not happy.</p>

<p>September: Nothing?!</p>

<p>October: We <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/10/16/new-architect/">switched architects</a> and have really enjoyed working with Tom and Dan. <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/10/28/hudson-is-officially-walking/">Hudson started walking</a> finally! I think his head is so big that he’s so top-heavy that it’s hard for him to balance.</p>

<p>November: <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/11/01/im-40/">I turned 40</a> without much care, surprisingly. We celebrated <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/11/26/thanksgiving-2009/">Thanksgiving</a>, still my favorite holiday. <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/11/27/illy-is-14/">Illy turned 14</a> and is starting to show her age with bad arthritis and deafness.</p>

<p>December: We <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/12/06/seattle-to-cabo/">went to Cabo San Lucas</a>, Mexico. We celebrated <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/12/25/christmas-day/">Christmas</a>.</p>

<p>It’s our first full year with two kids, which continues to make our lives noisy on the inside and quiet on the outside. We were able to spend most of the year working on our new business – being productive again feels good and we have a much healthier attitude about it. I read far fewer books than I did last year because we’ve been spending our time working. We still have Kelly, who has been great as our nanny and who makes it possible for us to spend time in the office knowing the kids are having fun, learning, playing and are safe.</p>

<p>Although we’re going through the design process for our new house on Vashon, we have lingering reservations about the kids growing up on Vashon, although we love it here. It’s been two years now that we’ve been trying to figure this out, but we should come to terms with this in 2010.</p>

<p>2008: <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/12/31/year-in-review-2/">Year in Review</a>.</p>

            <a class="post-link" href="/2010/01/01/favorite-albums-of-2009.html">Favorite Albums of 2009</a>
          </h3>
            <p>For the last few years, we’ve given our favorite albums to friends as Christmas gifts. We’re sharing what we like and hopefully helping others to find a song or two that they like, or if they already have it or find out what they don’t like it they can gift the CDs to someone else.</p>

<p>I realized while writing this up that four of these CDs are very light and almost ambient music. I mostly listen to music these days while at my desk as background music so maybe this is why I like these albums. Or I’ve just gotten older.

**Air <em>Love 2</em>
**
We discovered Air’s <em>Moon Safari</em> album many years ago when we first started dating and it was on the stereo a lot. I’ve been buying their albums ever since and all are good. Nobody seems to agree with me on this, but I swear the singer sounds like Michael Jackson sometimes – Michael Jackson the pop star, not Michael Jackson the beer guy. I like it anyway. It’s electronic music and sounds very European to me, in a good way, which makes sense since they’re French. They did the soundtrack to the movie <em>Virgin Suicides</em>, which I really like and is more somber than their other albums, but kinda creepy if you’ve seen the movie.</p>

<p>My favorites on this album are “Do The Joy”, “So Light Is Her Footfall”, “Be A Bee”, “Tropical Disease” and “Heaven’s Light”. “Missing the Light Of Day” reminds me of early Depeche Mode.</p>

<p>**Jason Lytle <em>Yours Truly, The Commuter</em>
**
Jason Lytle was in a band called Grandaddy. They’re no more and he’s gone solo but you wouldn’t know it; the music sounds the same as do most of the songs: a droning guitar with Jason’s airy voice. If you like this, you’ll like Grandaddy’s albums too. My favorite of theirs is <em>Sumday</em>.</p>

<p>My favorites: “Yours Truly, The Commuter”, “Brand New Sun”, “Ghost Of My Old Dog” (makes me think of <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/09/11/ouzo-1999-2008/">Ouzo</a> every time I hear it), “Birds Encouraged Him”, “Furget It”, “This Song Is the Mute Button”, “You’re Too Gone”, “Flying Thru Canyons” and “Here For Good”. That’s practically the whole album because they all sound the same. :-)</p>

<p><strong>Kings Of Convenience <em>Declaration Of Dependence</em></strong></p>

<p>Very wussy, but pleasant. All guitar, no drums at all. The cover makes you think it’s calypso music or something, doesn’t it? It’s not. Just two Norwegian guys playing guitar and, I think, trying to sound like Simon &amp; Garfunkel. They became famous in alternative circles when their first album <em>Quiet is the New Loud</em> came out in 2001. Their two previous albums are also very good. If you like this, you’ll definitely like those. The album is supposed to be very political, anti-Bush (remember that guy?) and the album title is obviously a pun on the title of the US’ founding document. But I don’t pay much attention to lyrics these days and the songs don’t sound overtly political to me.</p>

<p>Favorites: “24-25”, “Mrs. Cold” (could have come off either of their previous albums), “Rule My World”, “Peacetime Resistance” and “Riot on an Empty Street” (the name of a previous album).</p>

<p>**Monsters of Folk <em>Monsters of Folk</em>
**
I’m naturally resistant to the idea of folk music, although some music I like is considered folk music. I don’t know why this is considered folk. Maybe I don’t know what folk music is. Anyway, it’s made by 4 guys from various bands, including Conor Oberst, which is why I bought it in the first place, and another guy from his band Bright Eyes, some guy from My Morning Jacket and some other guy from She &amp; Him, a.k.a., the band with actress Zooey Deschanel. Lots of catchy stuff, I think. This is the one album that is not so wussy, but I guess it kinda is too.</p>

<p>Favorites: “Dear God”, “Whole Lotta Losin’”, Temazcal (Conor Oberst sings this), “Ahead of the Curve” (another Conor Oberst one), “Magic Marker”, “Map of the World” (Conor Oberst), “The Sandman, the Brakeman and Me” and “His Master’s Voice”. I like a couple others I didn’t list because they’re so country-sounding I don’t want to admit to myself that I like them.</p>

<p>**St. Vincent <em>Actor</em>
**
Gay heard a song by someone named “St. Vincent” while running one day and told me to get the album. So I did and this is it. It turns out that she was in the band The Polyphonic Spree and was in Sufjan Stevens’ (two moderately famous alternative bands) touring band for a while. It kinda reminds me of some  Arcade Fire songs.</p>

<p>Favorites: “The Strangers” (the song Gay heard), “Save Me From What I Want”, “Actor Out Of Work”, “Laughing With a Mouth Of Blood”, “The Bed”, “The Party”, “Just The Same But Brand New” and “Bicycle”. I don’t know if the CD has the song “Bicycle” on it, it might be just on the download version, but if you like the rest of this album let me know and I’ll give you a copy of it.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Our gift from Santa this year was the <a href="http://www.withings.com/">Withings internet-connected body scale</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.withings.com/en/bodyscale/design"><img src="http://www.withings.com/images/corp/en/balance/balancePerspective.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>It knows who you are when you step on it, it measures your weight and your body fat percentage and sends it to the withings.com site, via WiFi, where they provide nice graphs over time. And they have an iPhone app too. In fact, you can configure it with an iPhone… you turn it over and there’s a cradle for the iPhone, you launch their app, press a button on the scale and they start talking to each other and the iPhone asks you questions about how you want it configured. Very slick. They even have <a href="http://www.withings.com/en/api/bodyscale">a web API</a>.</p>

<p>Our old scale also measured fat percentage but to record the measurements we had to do it manually and I often forgot to do it. This one looks better and is automatic. I love automation. How long until I can get an internet-connected <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphygmomanometer">sphygmomanometer</a> and elliptical machine?</p>
