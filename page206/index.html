          <p><a href="http://www.roadcycling.com/news/article1187.shtml">David Cohen</a> of RoadCycling.com says that Armstrong won’t win the Tour this year because the other riders are younger and more motivated to win. I don’t buy it, they were younger last year and why weren’t they motivated to prevent him from winning his 5th or the record-breaking 6th?</p>

<p><a href="http://olntv.com">Outdoor Life Network</a> did their final “Road to the Tour” yesterday and Phil Liggett was sure favoring Armstrong and proclaiming that this year’s Discovery Team is the strongest team Lance has had in the Tour. He even said disagreed with Lance saying that <a href="http://www.t-mobile-team.com/cms/tmoteam/en/team/team2005/riders/templateId=renderInternalPage/contentID=8122/id=9158.html">Andreas Kloden</a>, a strong contender, is “riding like a sack of potatoes”. :)</p>

<p>T-Mobile has the second strongest team, in my opinion, but whether they’re all motivated to help <a href="http://www.t-mobile-team.com/cms/tmoteam/en/team/team2005/riders/templateId=renderInternalPage/contentID=8176/id=9158.html">Jan Ullrich</a> win is the question. <a href="http://www.t-mobile-team.com/cms/tmoteam/en/team/team2005/riders/templateId=renderInternalPage/contentID=8194/id=9158.html">Vinokourov</a> could be better than Ullrich. And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Basso">Ivan Basso</a> is another threat.</p>

<p>Regardless, it should be a good Tour this year!</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Steve Jobs <a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html">spoke at Stanford’s graduation</a> last weekend. For someone who is famously private, he’s surprisingly candid about his life and career. Here’s some good advice:</p>

<blockquote>Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle.</blockquote>

<p>When I was a kid and accidentally discovered how much fun I had making software, I watched Apple become a great company (the first time) and saw Steve Jobs as a true visionary. His recent return to Apple proves it all over again. I’ve always admired his ability to get to the point in his businesses and deliver great stuff. After reading his speech, I admire his ability to do the same with life.</p>

<p>This is a shot on the ferry leaving Vashon and going to Seattle, where we attended the wedding of Gay’s cousin Saturday night.</p>

It’s a famous hotel in San Diego, built in 1888 and restored in the 20th century. All in all, a nicer hotel with more friendly staff than the <a href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/whotels/index.html">W</a> in downtown, and half the price!</p>

<p>We flew back Tuesday afternoon and arrived in rainy Seattle and home at 7pm. Gay’s dad and aunt stayed at the house while we were gone and they really tired Ouzo out, which is not easy.</p>

She’s been training for it all year long, running 5-10 miles a day during the week and 20-25 mile runs on weekends.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15373293@N00/18250934/"><img src="http://photos13.flickr.com/18250934_7fe57c4fa9_m.jpg" alt="Picture157_04Jun05" /></a>We got in at 2pm, checked into the hotel and then walked to the convention center to pick up her packet. The exciting news for us is that we met <a href="http://www.trainright.com/">Chris Carmichael</a>, Lance Armstrong’s trainer, after a little Q&amp;A thing he did at the expo and we got a photo of Gay with him. It was a surprise that he’d be here, so that was our excitement for the afternoon.</p>

<p>Then off to a carb-loading dinner at <a href="http://www.demedici.signonsandiego.com/">De Medici</a> with Megan, Jon and Megan’s parents (who also flew in to watch the marathon) Saturday night.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15373293@N00/18248320/"><img src="http://photos13.flickr.com/18248320_ac322a60d3_m.jpg" alt="Pre-Marathon" /></a>We woke up at 5:30am Sunday morning, planning to be picked up by Megan’s parents in their rental car to take us to the start line, but they found out that they couldn’t get to the hotel thanks to the streets being blocked off for the marathon. Fortunately, another runner at our hotel scheduled a hotel car to take him to the start, so we got a ride with him and were lucky enough to be dropped off only two blocks from the start. Megan and Jon, on the other hand, had to park on the other side of the <a href="http://www.sandiegozoo.org/">San Diego Zoo</a> and hike to the start line.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15373293@N00/18248398/"><img src="http://photos13.flickr.com/18248398_347c4244a0_m.jpg" alt="Gay &amp; Megan" /></a>At 6:30am the run started and Gay and Megan crossed the start line at 6:41am. Jon, Megan’s parents and I then walked from the start to mile 8 to  see them. Here’s the mile 8 station, the only place we could manage  to see them on the race route since it’s so difficult to drive and  park around the city because all the roads are blocked off. Me and  Megan’s dad handed out water cups to the runners until Gay &amp; Megan   reached this point. The day was overcast throughout the race which  kept it much cooler than a sunny day. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15373293@N00/18248433/"><img src="http://photos13.flickr.com/18248433_2a5e161133_m.jpg" alt="Gay &amp; Megan walking to start" /></a></p>

<p>We then walked back to the start line, through the park, by the San  Diego Zoo to the car that Megan’s parents’ rental car. We stopped at a  Starbucks for  coffee and then headed to the finish line. This took  us a good hour and then we had to park a half a mile away from the  parking lot since it was full. We then took a shuttle through the  Marine base to the finish line about an hour before they would  finish. You could sign up to receive notifications on your cell phone  as they crossed several points through the race (they wore little  chips on their shoes that tracked them electronically). This was very  handy so we could tell where they were and when they would reach each point.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15373293@N00/18248532/"><img src="http://photos12.flickr.com/18248532_ef788c8820_m.jpg" alt="Post-race beer" /></a>Here they are (with Jon) at the finish having a “beer”. Michelob Ultra… talk about the dumbest beer to serve at the end of a marathon: a beer with low carbs. I wonder if the hot dogs they were selling were protein-free. By noon, we were back at their apartment having beer and ordering pizza. Megan’s parents left for their evening flight back home and we all went back to our hotel to clean up, change and then to the bar for a couple drinks. After a quick stop at <a href="http://www.yardhouse.com/location.asp?id=8">The Yardhouse</a> (just because they have <a href="http://fullers.co.uk/">Fuller’s</a> ESB on tap) we had dinner at a Mexican restaurant and then back home.</p>
