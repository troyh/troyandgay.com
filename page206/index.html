            <p><a href="http://www.velonews.com/race/int/articles/8736.0.html">It looks like</a> Levi Leipheimer will win the Tour of Germany tomorrow. Levi is picked as one of the most likely Americans, among Floyd Landis and Tom Danielson, to succeed Armstrong as a Tour de France winner.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>It’s been a year since the last redesign, right after we were married. I’ve been sick of the design for many months but was too busy and even when not, I never sat down to do a redesign. Tonight, Gay went to a friend’s bachelorette party and I opened a bottle of wine and sat down and just did it. And there it is. Let’s see if it can last a year before I get sick of it. To lessen the chance of it getting boring quickly, I can switch out the photo easily and, assuming I have a good photo to use, I will. I hope.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>For the first time, VeloNews.com <a href="http://www.velonews.com/pr/prn/articles/8724.0.html">made more money</a> from advertising on their web site than their print issue. How many offline/online publications can say that? Not many, if any. Granted, this was the Tour de France month but it’s an interesting sign of the times, I think. What they seem to have found is something I’ve never heard a print publisher hint at: that advertising on the web can grow dynamically throughout the month while print publications have to forecast interest in their issues and sell ads based on that.</p>

<p>I had always assumed that the print publishing world was doomed simply because people would demand the more timely, more dynamic online version, i.e., it’d be reader-driven. But if this is the start of a new trend, the print publishing world’s demise may be driven by the publishers, not the readers.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Another sidetrack from <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=3103">our vacation</a>, here is my favorite piece of art from the <a href="http://www.cnac-gp.fr/Pompidou/Accueil.nsf/tunnel?OpenForm">Pompidou Center</a> in Paris. It’s a “body transit case”. :)  I love it not simply because it was so well-made it looks like it was actually manufactured, but because it couldn’t possibly be made. We ship everything, including many living things, but never a human. Why not? I don’t know, we just can’t. It’s brilliant. The usual icons for “This side up”, “Don’t get wet” and “Fragile” are included, of course.</p>

<p>You’ll notice the two vents where the person’s face would be, but what’s not pictured is a third vent on the bottom. The artist thought of everything. :)</p>
