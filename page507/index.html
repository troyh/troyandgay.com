          <p>AT&amp;T was flakey last night from about 8:15pm on and was really down from about midnight on. So the MRTG graphs look terrible (100% CPU), but they’re not really. I reset the cable modem at around 7:40am and it seems to be working again.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Two days ago, there was a <a href="http://www.ecipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=13754&amp;74">discussion about a bad review</a> and I suggested a “sportsmanship” ranking that would decrease when people complain about their reviews. Lennie really didn’t like it and got very upset and hasn’t been back to the Talk boards since (looking at the logs, though, she has been back yesterday to read a lot of Talk posts. :-). Others <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=13788&amp;27">came to our defense</a>.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Today was one of the more relaxing days we’ve had in a while. No big performance fires, we went to lunch at The Stray Dog (where we ran into Gary and talked with him over lunch), went grocery shopping and then I worked outside on the iBook for several hours (with the dogs and my iPod).</p>

<p>We even fixed a few performance problems in the Talk code (removed 3 unnecessary SQL queries).</p>

          <p>I setup all our linux servers to sync their time via <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/">NTP</a>. Actually, just newyork syncs with NTP and the other servers sync with newyork. I like that we have accurate time. :-)</p>

          <p>If you’ve got time, read <a href="http://www.viridiandesign.org/notes/301-350/00325_open_source_speech.html">Bruce Sterling’s long rambling rant</a> about Open Source and Closed Source and just about everything else in the software industry. He seems to be pretty angry about the economy and bad software.</p>
