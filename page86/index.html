              <p>We slept well and woke up at 6:30a. We got dressed and went to Top Pot for coffee and doughnuts. We took a dozen doughnuts and a box of coffee back to the house for everyone who was coming over this morning.</p>

<p>Jim Dow was the first to show up. He brought his adorable new puppy, Blue, and his other dog, Beau, both Alaskan Malamutes, over too. His crew showed up a few minutes later. Tom arrived, then Dan (by bike!) got there and we took Tom through the house showing him our plans while the Schuchart/Dow guys started putting down protection on the floors and walls to prepare for the selective demolition.</p>

<p>Tom showed us again why he’s so good at what he does. We think we’re pretty good at understanding how we live, what we like and our daily routines. And we’re pretty good about thinking things through and organizing things for usability and efficiency. We’d been thinking about the house for weeks and drawing various plans for each room. Tom, after just minutes, in almost every room had better ideas. It was just like it was working with him on the Vashon house design. Other architects we worked with took days to formulate concrete ideas, Tom could listen to us and immediately start sketching out a couple ideas.</p>

<p>For example, there’s a powder room on the main floor that will be used often. Unfortunately, it is down a couple steps from the main floor. It was a little annoying that you have to step down a couple steps and the orientation of the bathroom was odd. We had no good ideas for it without doing major structural work around it. Jim pointed this problem out to Tom and within a minute Tom had an idea for raising the powder room to avoid the steps and to have a better orientation with more space. Just like that, he solved a problem that we were prepared to live with. It’s fun to work with someone like that.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s because of the housing crisis that architects don’t have a lot of work to do, but Tom builds houses all over the world and even now is in super-high demand so he can pick and choose the work he wants to do. Yet he’s willing and, frankly, excited to do <em>a remodel</em> (which is usually the dregs of work for architects) for us. He’s a guy who loves his job. Granted, he’s at the level where he describes things and lower-level people do the actual drawings and work out the details so he can work on lots of projects at once, but I’m still surprised we can even get him for this project.</p>

<p>We got the results of the hazardous materials tests and, shockingly, learned that there is no lead in any paint samples they took. I don’t understand how that could be. I thought it was practically guaranteed that you’d have lead in paint manufactured in the 1970s and earlier. Maybe they only painted later??? This is good because it’s expensive (10-15% more) to remove it because it requires special care and must follow strict disposal guidelines. The tile flooring is a different matter and the kitchen flooring is practically lethal, but all that is coming out anyway, so that’s not a big deal either.</p>

<p>They did a little demolition to figure out which direction the floor joists run to tell us which walls are load-bearing and require structural work to change. So far, our guesses were correct so the work we want to do is going to be straightforward so far. Other good news is that the 2-foot drop ceiling they installed in the kitchen was not done to cover up some horrible secret in the ceiling above. Who wants 10-foot ceilings when you can have 8-foot ceilings? Me! The original architect must have been pretty smart because it seems that all the spans were designed to require few load-bearing walls in the middle of the house. This makes it much easier to move walls. There is one wall in the kid’s bathroom we were sure was load-bearing and it made it hard to work around, but it doesn’t appear that it is.</p>

<p>Everything else is turning out better than expected too. Time and time again, we’re finding that the previous owners took better care of the house than we thought. The dubious choices in remodels over the years are not an indication of a tendency for poor maintenance, I guess. That makes us feel better because we paid a bit more for the house than we would have liked based on our assumptions that it required much more repair work.</p>

<p>We’re sure to find some crazy stuff in the plumbing and electrical just based on how old the house is, but so far, so good.</p>

<p>A cute Havana story: with all the people coming in over the day we repeatedly  introduced ourselves and also introduced Havana and Hudson. Havana followed me and one guy around as we walked and talked and she kept trying to get my attention.  I kept asking her what she wanted but she kept talking too quietly for me to understand her because she didn’t want him to hear, so I was also continuing the conversation with the guy. After the 4th or 5th time I figured out what she was saying.  She was saying “Daddy, tell him my name.” I had forgotten to introduce her.</p>

              <p>We made it onto the 9:40a ferry to Seattle and, thanks to the lane closure on the West Seattle bridge, didn’t get to the house until just before 11a. Havana and Hudson immediately ran through the entire house pointing out every room they found as if we’d never seen it before. They were pretty excited.</p>

<p>There were sunflowers and a very nice hand-made (with a photo she took in India, apparently) card were in the house from one of the family members who grew up in the house welcoming us:</p>

<p>Nancy, My and Laura came over for another walk-through now that we have plans closer to what we will do. We are having other contractors give us estimates too so there was about 20 people walking through the house.</p>

<p>We set up camp in the master bedroom and the kids took an afternoon nap. We met some more neighbors that stopped by to introduce themselves. Then we went to the grocery store and picked up some champagne, beer and other stuff to celebrate. Megan, Jon, Eric, Steve, Steve, Renuka, Owen and Claire all came over around 6 and we popped open the champagne and beer and ordered pizzas from Mad Pizza. Pizza delivery is one of the things I have been looking forward to the most being back in the city – there’s no such thing as that on Vashon (technically, just recently there has been, but not from the good pizza place).</p>

<p>While standing outside, a guy came over and asked us if we were the new owners. He is friends with the a grand-daughter (great grand-daughter?) of <a href="http://brewerygems.com/andrew.htm">Andrew Hemrich</a>, the beer baron, father of Rainier Beer, who built the house in 1909. She lives nearby and has never been inside the house. Hopefully, we’ll get the chance to show it to her before the renovation begins.</p>

<p>One of our new neighbors is a guy we worked with in Outlook at Microsoft and his wife and 2 kids – he was even one of the people who interviewed me for a job while I was visiting in 1996, so he’s partly responsible for me living here in the first place, meeting Gay, etc. He and his wife saw us in the yard and welcomed us to the neighborhood. Small world.</p>

<p>Everyone left by 10p, the kids were in bed and Gay and I sat on the front porch for an hour. The temperature was mid-60s but I was wearing shorts and a short-sleeve shirt. At our place on Vashon, without protection from the breeze off the water, we can’t stay out past 8pm without a fleece and long pants on! It’s going to be fun living in the city again. We spent our 30s in the country and will spend our 40s in the city – not the typical migration path.</p>

              <p>Contador took the race lead today after attacking race-leader Andy Schleck after he had a mechanical problem. I’m no fan of crybaby Contador and I hate to see him win the Tour that way, but it’s part of the sport.</p>

<p>When interviewed about it, he shouldn’t have lied and said he didn’t know he had a problem – the guy was standing still when he rode around him. How could he have not known?!? At least he was booed when he took the podium to put on the yellow jersey. I’ve never seen/heard that before.</p>

<p>Maybe Contador will have a mechanical and lose the race this week. He’ll whine that it’s unfair when it happens to him, I’m sure. That’d be fun to see.</p>

<blockquote>Contador just gained a great chance to win, but he lost the chance to win greatly.</blockquote>

              <p>Kelly told us this morning that she just heard that a friend of hers was killed in Afghanistan this weekend. We realized she was talking about Robert Bennedsen, the model in “this blog post”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2005/07/01/3099/, and the son of our friends Scott and Tracy. Tracy did flowers for our wedding and Scott cooked the pig for the wedding feast.</p>

<p>He was just 25 years old. We only met him a couple times at their July 4th parties. He was a good smart kid and had far too short a life.</p>

<p>Our condolences to Scott &amp; Tracy.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>We are taking possession of the house today at 9pm. The previous owners were being a little difficult about it. We were originally supposed to take possession yesterday but, because the closing was delayed a day, they decided they’d be sticklers and make us wait another 24  hours to take possession. They insisted on this even though they had over 30 days since we agreed on the sale and they only found out that it would be delayed hours before it was delayed.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>It wasn’t a big deal to us, but we had already scheduled the hazardous materials guy to take samples to test for asbestos at 9am today. Their tests take 48  hours to complete so we couldn’t start any demolition until then, so it was important to us to have the samples done today so demolition can start Thursday. Yesterday afternoon, their agent told our agent that we would have to reschedule it – and on a Sunday when their office is closed. No explanation, no apology. They said they need to “have time with the house to say goodbye”. They had 2 years while the house was on the market and they had over 30 days since it was sold to have their time with the house, why do they need this extra 24 hours that they didn’t even know they had until last Thursday??!</p>

<p>It seemed to us that they were just being difficult because they could be difficult. They demanded to have until 9pm Monday night. We explained to them that we just need a couple hours in the morning and they could have the rest of the day with the house. They still refused.</p>

<p>We tried to be accommodating, but we’d had enough. Since we are the owners, and essentially their landlords, and because the contract stipulated that we were to receive a key upon closing and we were legally allowed”reasonable access” to the house, our agent told their agent that we wanted a key and that we’re coming in at 9am anyway.</p>

<p>When we got there this morning, there were two people from the family there. The guy was nice enough, came to meet us, congratulate us on the house, etc. But his sister introduced herself and said something to the effect of “I want my expectations set. How long will you be here?” She wasn’t angry or forceful, but it was weird. They were still packing up the last bit of stuff in one room upstairs, they were essentially done. Why didn’t they hire movers?! There was hardly any furniture in the place, it was mostly just boxes in the house when we were looking at it weeks before. A moving company could have cleared the place out in hours and it would have only cost a couple hundred bucks. We explained that we wouldn’t be long and we’d stay out of their way.</p>

<p>As we walked around the place with we were asked two more times how long we’d be there in the same way (“I want my expectations set. How long will you be here?”) and, as we were walking out of the house, their agent called our agent telling her that they wanted us to leave immediately. We never bothered them and we weren’t in their way. Weird. They said she had bad asthma and was very sensitive to dirt in the air, but I think she might be super-paranoid about people in the house, like she’s scared of everyone. Apparently, she demanded that their agent be in the house for all showings even if a buyer’s agent was showing the house, which is unusual in the real estate world.</p>

<p>Today, there was a crucifix on the wall and a Virgin Mary on the countertop in the dining room that were not there before. Do Catholics do exorcisms or perform some ceremony when they sell houses and does it have to happen on the last day???</p>

<p>Anyway…. I’m glad we got to meet at least some of the family, even if it wasn’t that friendly of a meeting. And they wished us many happy years in the house as they had had.</p>

<p>We went out to lunch, had duplicate keys of the house made, went to Gay’s quick doctor’s appointment and barely made the 3:05p ferry home.</p>

<p>Now the action starts. We’re heading back again tomorrow morning to meet with the interior designer again and to show them our drawings for the changes we’re going to make. Then we’ll spend the day at the house with the kids taking the “before” photos for the before &amp; after photos. Some friends are stopping by in the evening to celebrate with us. We’re going to spend the night so that we’ll be there Wednesday morning to meet Tom and Dan, the architects, and when some construction people will be there to prepare for the demolition on Thursday.</p>
