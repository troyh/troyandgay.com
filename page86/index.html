          <p>We took Hudson to his pediatrician to get <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/03/11/hudsons-first-stitches/">his stitches</a> removed. Poor guy, we had to hold him down and still so she could remove them and he got scared of the tweezers and scissors coming toward his eye. He kept yelling “Dop! Dop!” (“Stop! Stop!” in Hudson-speak) which is not fun to hear for a parent. He quickly forgot about it after it was done and we went to lunch after where he had fun playing with the salt and pepper shakers. The cut looks good so far. Hopefully it won’t have much scarring, if any.</p>

          <p>Last night before dinner Gay heard Hudson crying and found him laying on the floor next to the living room steps. He had a cut above his left eye. We put Neosporin and a Band-Aid on it and thought he’d be okay. He stopped crying, at least.</p>

<p>Gay was still worried about it since it was on his face and could end up as a scar. I tried to convince her that he’d be fine and we went to bed. At 12:30am, Havana was woken up by the wind and rain on her window and came into our room. I discovered that Gay wasn’t there and didn’t find her in Hudson’s room either. I checked my phone and found a text message from Gay. At midnight, she decided to take Hudson to the hospital in Seattle. Havana slept with me in our bed and Gay and Hudson got home at 6am. Hudson got 4 stitches and hopefully will not have a scar. He slept a couple more hours and seems to be back to normal, with some puffiness over his eye where they put the local anesthesia.</p>

          <p>I’m documenting this here so I can diagnose myself the next time this happens…</p>

<p>On the flight back from San Francisco I put my in-ear headphones in and a few minutes later Gay said something to me so I took the right one out to hear her. The ear bud came off and was stuck in my ear and I couldn’t get it out. I had to wait until I got home 3 hours later to remove it. After removing it, I still felt like my ear was plugged. It started to hurt more and more over the next day.</p>

<p>Gay had a similar problem a couple years ago and was prescribed <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?id=8978"><strong>Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates and Hydrocortisone OTIC Suspension, USP</strong></a>. She didn’t use it all and kept it in her drawer. So I tried it. The next day the pain was gone and the day after that my ear was  fine again.</p>

<p>Before my next flight, I’m going to get noise-canceling headphones that don’t go in my ear.</p>

          <p>We dropped down to the 2-at-a-time plan on Netflix. They just can’t get us any of the new movies anymore. We’ll save $10/month which will allow us to get 2 new movies a month via download for “free”.</p>
