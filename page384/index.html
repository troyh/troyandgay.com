I’m almost halfway done but my Harry Potter is due to arrive any day now and I’m afraid once I put this tome down I may not go back.  For as lengthy as it is, I find myself wishing Blumenthal would go into more character detail about the players.  The book is really starting to pick up now that I have reached the period where the author has joined the staff.  …and if you ever thought there was anything <em>but</em> a right-wing conspiracy, you should read this book.</p>

              <p>Our friends John &amp; Deborah served us, and their 15 year old son JT, a most delicious steak dinner (and probably one too many cocktails) last Saturday.  We haven’t had much opportunity to hang out with teenagers in the past 15 years.  JT’s a good kid, and an especially good sport as parents and child started trading embarrassing stories about each other.  At one point Deborah asked demonstratively if was “like [JT] as a kid”.  I said “I was and am now appalled” at how derisive kids can be a their parents, even when joking.  That said, it was sort of fun to have a friend at home to play Trivial Pursuit with…</p>

              <p>This morning on my bike ride, I rode my usual route the opposite direction. The last time I did this, I couldn’t even get up the final hill without stopping to rest.  It’s about 350 feet of climbing, my legs were burning and I was in my lowest gear, but I did it!</p>

              <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/ipod.jpg" alt="ipod.jpg" />My new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> arrived last week.  Got a most excellent deal on the 30gig version from dell, though <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/05/001428.php">it took like a month to get here</a>.  I’ve experienced the same problems others have with hangs and resets running with it in the clip, but only rarely now that i run with it in my hand.  I’m now on a cd burning spree and rediscovering old music.  I’ve got 12gigs/2959 songs so far.  I can’t begin to express how interesting it is to listen to music that entered my collection 10-15 years ago (too bad kevin doesn’t have a blog for me to link to his dissertation on this), though I’m sure there are blog entries to come about certain bands – I’m only up to the Cs in my ripping.  One thing i did want to mention is the utter beauty of this device.  I thought Troy’s 5gig iPod was cool when he got it last year, but this is lighter, smaller and just amazing to control with the heat-sensitive buttons and circular trackpad.  I’m surprised Troy hasn’t posted the photos of us unpacking it.  Now we just need to <a href="http://gallery.ipodlounge.com/index.php">post a photo of gPod on Vashon</a></p>
