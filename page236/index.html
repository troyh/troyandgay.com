        <article>
          <p>I finally solved the <a href="http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2709">Airport Express problem</a> I’ve had since I got it. The Airport Express would simply “drop-out” for a second or more. This wasn’t that noticeable when streaming music since iTunes buffers so much that a short loss of network connectivity had no effect. But when I used it to <a href="http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2888">set up our temporary office</a>, the drops were much more noticeable since I live in ssh sessions to various servers.</p>

<p>After lots of trial and error, I simply unplugged our older Linksys access point. It’s an 802.11b access point and the Express was getting confused between it and the newer 802.11g access point also in the house. Not a single dropped connection since! Fortunately, it doesn’t appear that we need the 802.11b since the greater range of the 802.11g access point seems to cover the house.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2004/11/17/is-wal-mart-good-for-america.html">Is Wal-Mart good for America?</a>
        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>We watched <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/walmart/">Frontline’s show about Wal-Mart</a> last night. Wal-Mart’s incredible power in the marketplace is not new information, but the extent to which Wal-Mart is benefitting China is new to me.</p>

<p>Wal-Mart’s mission to drive prices down for American consumers has the effect of squeezing American manufacturers to the point of bankruptcy, given that they can only go so low on wages to their employees. But China’s labor costs are extremely low, so Wal-Mart is increasingly relying on China’s manufacturers to give Americans their low prices.</p>

<p>That’s great for China, obviously, but maybe not so good for America. As one interviewee points out, it’d be wonderful for Americans if Americans were consumers only because they’re saving money, but Americans also need jobs. And this has a profound effect on our trade deficit – the US exports $3 billion worth of goods to China and imports $36 billion a year. In fact, our exports (raw materials, mostly) are being used by the Chinese manufacturers to build products that they sell back to us.</p>

<p>One American company fought back, though, and won. Five Rivers, an American manufacturer of television components, sued and <a href="http://www.laborresearch.org/story.php?id=339">forced anti-dumping tariffs on China</a>. This effectively increased the costs to Chinese manufacturers for television components (Wal-Mart helped to defend the Chinese manufacturers in the legal case). But it may have been too late for Five Rivers – <a href="http://www.thedailytimes.com/sited/story/html/176894">they filed for bankruptcy last month</a>.</p>

<p>What made America strong economically, a large population of consumers with money to spend, could come to an end given that our jobs are decreasing in pay. With four times the population and increasing wages, China’s larger market of wealthier people could make China <em>the</em> economic superpower that dwarfs America’s economy.</p>

<p>Is this simply capitalism running its course? Is it the global economy being realized? Is Wal-Mart a company that is transforming American retail business to the benefit of the American economy? Or is Wal-Mart single-handedly turning China into an economic superpower? Will <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/business/20041117-1017-wallstreet.html">today’s merger of K-Mart and Sears</a>, two of Wal-Mart’s victims, create a second Wal-Mart and increase our reliance on China?</p>

          <p>Bambi Francisco <a href="http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B2774D8EE%2D6569%2D422A%2D807C%2D46F2587D0CE6%7D&amp;siteid=mktw&amp;dist=">reports that the web will continue to be advertising-based rather than subscription-based</a>. She concludes this in spite of optimistic numbers for paid-sites, which is fairly new compared to almost a decade of online advertising. And she completely ignored the fact that online advertising is a tiny tiny tiny fraction of what it was in 1999 ($30/CPMs versus $1/CPMs today) – that’s not growth, it’s a slight bounce back from a number approaching zero.</p>

<p>And she incorrectly assumed that because total online advertising is increasing, that all sites supported by advertising are increasing their revenue. That would only be true if the size of the web, e.g., the number of web sites in existence, grew slower than advertising revenue. But that’s not true – the web is growing at exponential rates. If she asked a site that isn’t in the top 3 sites on the web, she would have heard a very different story: that advertising is decreasing in revenue and if a site is earning more revenue, it’s only because the traffic has grown at a higher rate than the advertising revenue per CPM has declined.</p>

<p>But although she tried to extrapolate it to <em>all</em> sites, her main point is about news sites. I agree that for news sites, advertising is the only way to go because news is fleeting; the masses don’t care about old news so old news is worthless. So charging for archives is hopeless. If a news site wants to charge for content, they’d better have exclusive content. But that’s news sites’ fatal flaw: news cannot be exclusive. For example, no news site could have kept the results of the 2004 Presidential election a secret for paid subscribers only.</p>

<p>But that’s not true for sites that provide a useful service that goes beyond the content itself. <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> recently launched a pay version of the site that gives members additional features that free members don’t get. If we continue at our current rate for the rest of the 12 months, our first year will account for 30-40% of our advertising revenue. Not bad for the first year! And I expect that to only increase while advertising revenue continues to decrease. This works because Recipezaar is a web application, i.e., it’s software.</p>

<p>A web site is either a printing press or it’s an application. The economic future of the web is clear: advertising will (barely) support printing press web sites and fees will support advertising-free application sites.</p>

          <p>The Eagles made laughing stocks out of the Cowboys tonight, 49-21, making them the second and only team to reach 8-1 this year. I predict the Eagles and Steelers will be in the Super Bowl. And the Steelers will win, of course.</p>

          <p>After a couple days of no work done, they returned today for a fury of work … that lasted three hours. The drywall tape and mud has been put on and is drying. Supposedly, they do two (or three?!) coats, so it’s still a couple more uneventful days.</p>

<p>We’ve come to the realization that our hope of having it complete by Thanksgiving is shot. And I’m not confident it’ll be done by Christmas either at this rate, even if we do get the flooring decided, ordered and delivered in time.</p>
