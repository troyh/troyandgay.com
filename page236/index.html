            <p>This afternoon a couple came to our house to look at the design because they are building a house on Vashon and their architect told them he designed our house and that they should take a look at it. He didn’t design the house (wrong architect’s name) but they wanted to see it anyway to see whatever he was telling them our house had. I showed them part of the house and started getting a little suspicious that this wasn’t on the up and up so I decided not to show them any more of the house. They left.</p>

<p>But then I got to thinking…. not only was it odd if they were telling the truth, it was odd that they knew so much about us personally and they mentioned our crazy neighbor by name. Did their architect tell them to go meet crazy Judith while they’re here checking out our house? When someone mentions her by name, you gotta wonder how sane they are too. She owns a B&amp;B and has some exaggerated stories about our house (and other neighbors) and I wonder if they weren’t guests at her B&amp;B and she told them to go make up a story about how they’re building a house and wanted to look at ours just so they could see it. Why? Because she’s NUTS! And she has some weird fascination with our house, always asking us odd questions about it and once snuck away from a neighborhood Christmas cookie party we hosted to wander around it unnoticed (or so she thought).</p>

<p>This is the same woman who had a friend come over to get his dog who wandered into our yard and struck up a conversation with me while I was doing yardwork and made a point to tell me how beautiful his house is and how it “makes [our] place look like shit”. :)</p>

<p>And she’s the same woman who called the police at 8pm during our wedding reception at our house because of the noise, not realizing a wedding was going on. She didn’t realize we were having our wedding reception at our house even though her B&amp;B was full of guests to our wedding, including my parents and Gay’s parents!</p>

<p>Vashon is weird sometimes.</p>

            <p>We made three pies yesterday to bring to dinner last night at John &amp; Deborah’s:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/72390">Rumrunner’s Pecan Pie</a>
<a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/13888">Praline-Pumpkine Pie</a>
<a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/45970">Orange Crusted Pumpkin Pie with Bourbon Whipped Cream</a></p>

<p>John’s mother, his brother and his family was there too. Dinner was delicious and there was plenty of wine, of course. We left at about 12:30am, after Gay had one too many scotches and danced the evening away with Deborah. :)</p>

            <p>It’s Thanksgiving Day, my favorite holiday and a good time to talk about what I’m thankful for.</p>

<p>I’m thankful for my smart, caring, supportive and beautiful (new) wife and my somewhat smart and beautiful dogs who I spend the majority of my waking and sleeping life with and that they stick around even though I don’t show them enough how thankful I am for them.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I’ve received a few comments about how the preceding paragraph shouldn’t have lumped my wife and dogs together. Valid point. My intent was to mention the most important things to me in one paragraph. If I had kids, they’d be in there too. But my dogs are my kids. And I write this stuff off-the-cuff; it’s not well-edited so there’s plenty of mistakes, poorly-communicated thoughts and mis-spoken things said on this site – if not, it’d be a part-time job to keep this site updated. And I’d like to point out that my wife didn’t write a thing about being thankful for me, so there! :)</p>

<p>I’m thankful that I live in a quiet area surrounded by nature with plenty of privacy and some “interesting” neighbors who show me how fortunate I am.</p>

<p>I’m thankful for the lifestyle Gay &amp; I created together, that we created it <em>together</em> and even more thankful that the end is not in sight. :)</p>

<p>I’m thankful that I get to work at a job that I enjoy every second doing and for the opportunity to build something that is bigger than myself and my immediate existence. And I’m thankful that my job shows me how wonderful human beings can be and that the job’s very nature helps me to enjoy life through the simple pleasure of food.</p>

<p>I am thankful that I have good health and, more importantly, the knowledge and ability to maintain that good health (because I want to live to be 300+).</p>

<p>I’m thankful that my family is also in good health and that I am able to communicate with all of them even though I live on the other side of the country (although I don’t communicate with them enough).  And I’m thankful that they live on the other side of the country. ;)  (it’s a joke!).</p>

<p>I’m thankful for my new in-laws who accepted me into their family without a fight (that I’m aware of). And I’m thankful that my new mother-in-law is so easy-going and doesn’t mind a bit that I don’t email her enough and enjoys our political arguments as much as she does. And, of course, I’m thankful that she probably won’t read this. :)</p>

<p>I’m thankful for our old friends and that we’ve stayed in contact with them after moving way out to Vashon. And for our new friends on Vashon we’ve gained since moving here.</p>

<p>And finally, I’m thankful for the beer and wine I get to drink with friends tonight during dinner. :)</p>

            <p><a href="http://lists.ssc.com/pipermail/suitwatch/2004-November/000080.html">SuitWatch</a>: “Why do commercial software makers whine about    the “threat” of “commoditization” while analysts and press, mostly paid for by vendors, whine along in harmony? Second, why has nobody ever whined about the “threat” of physical commodities, such as those that give us food and shelter, that we can’t live without?”</p>

<p>The rest of it is a good read. And I like his construction industry analogy to software. When asked about my old of Program Manager at Microsoft, I always said a PM was like the architect (they don’t actually do the work, they just think about it) and I haven’t heard a better description yet. :)</p>

            <p>Illy had <a href="http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2943">an operation on Monday</a> to remove a mole. The vet called today with the lab results and the mole is benign. :)</p>
