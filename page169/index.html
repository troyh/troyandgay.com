            <p>Thomas Friedman wrote a good “op-ed article”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/30/opinion/30friedman.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;oref=slogin about the lack of an energy policy and points out the stupidity of McCain and Hillary focusing on a gas tax moratorium, Obama seems to be the only smart one on this topic:</p>

<p>bq. The McCain-Clinton gas holiday proposal is a perfect example of what energy expert Peter Schwartz of Global Business Network describes as the true American energy policy today: “Maximize demand, minimize supply and buy the rest from the people who hate us the most.”</p>

<p>It goes on to point out the lack of focus on alternative sources of energy like wind and solar:</p>

<p>bq. While all the presidential candidates were railing about lost manufacturing jobs in Ohio, no one noticed that America’s premier solar company, First Solar, from Toledo, Ohio, was opening its newest factory in the former East Germany – 540 high-paying engineering jobs – because Germany has created a booming solar market and America has not.</p>

<p>The attention the rising gas prices has received attention from all three candidates, which is just sympathy pandering, but why not pander to people in ways that create jobs?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> “Economists are pointing out”:http://uk.reuters.com/article/wtMostRead/idUKN3038243520080430?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 how stupid the idea is:</p>

<p>bq. “I think it is a very bad idea,” said Gilbert Metclaf, a economics professor at Tufts University currently working with the National Bureau of Economic Research. “If we want people to invest in energy-saving cars, we need some assurance that the higher price paid for these cars is going to pay off through fuel savings,” he said. “It is a very short-sighted, counterproductive proposal.”</p>

<p>bq. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman was similarly underwhelmed: “It’s Econ 101: the tax cut really goes to the oil companies,” he wrote on his blog on Tuesday.</p>

<p>And Obama had the most pithy line:</p>

<p>bq. “This isn’t an idea designed to get you through the summer, it’s an idea designed to get them through an election.</p>

            <p>Our yard maintenance guy of over 3 years quit abruptly today in protest when we hired a neighbor’s kid to mow our lawn for the summer. I’m usually not surprised when adults are petty and juvenile, but I expected more from this guy, a guy who prides himself on his “metaphysical awareness”. What’s ironic is that he refused to mow our lawn for years thinking it beneath his skill-level and only started mowing the lawn last September when we went on vacation. I guess at some point between September and yesterday he decided that mowing a lawn was a core part of his being and taking that away from him was more than he could bear. In retrospect, I shouldn’t be so surprised… last year he complained that we were wasting our money and his time when he held a hose for hours on end watering our garden. So we added a sprinkler to our irrigation system so he wouldn’t have to do that, but he then expressed anger at the loss of that job. Some people just can’t find happiness.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Today they took DE “Bruce Davis”:http://www.nfl.com/draft/profiles/bruce-davis?id=1695, OT “Tony Hills”:http://www.nfl.com/draft/profiles/tony-hills?id=258 – finally an offensive lineman!, QB “Dennis Dixon”:http://www.nfl.com/draft/profiles/dennis-dixon?id=748, LB “Mike Humpal”:http://www.nfl.com/draft/profiles/mike-humpal?id=1367 and FS “Ryan Mundy”:http://www.nfl.com/draft/profiles/ryan-mundy?id=4393.</p>

<p>They took 3 offensive players and 4 defensive players. All seem like good picks and everyone seems to be excited about Rashard Mendenhall. But don’t they know they need to improve their offensive line? As one commenter I saw said after they picked a QB, “they’ve just added another tackling dummy.”</p>

          </h3>
            <p>I seem to be on a religious trend here… we watched “For the Bible Tells Me Go”:http://www.netflix.com/Movie/For_the_Bible_Tells_Me_So/70059383?trkid=226870 last night. It’s a documentary about how people use the Bible to oppress non-whites and women. Now that they’ve largely given up on oppressing non-white and women because you look like a real lunatic doing that today, it’s the homosexuals’ turn. Falwell, Swaggert and James Dobson rile up their armies of hate to keep homosexuals out of society. And all make $100+ million a year, tax-free, doing it (What would Jesus think of that?).</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The most compelling reason Christians believe homosexuality is immoral is because, of course, the Bible says it is. They quote this:</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 18:22: Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.</p>

<p>And this:</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 20:13: If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.</p>

<p>But they stop reading there, because Leviticus goes on to say these things that Christians and their leaders regularly ignore:</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 19:27: Do not cut the hair at the sides of your head or clip off the edges of your beard.</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 19:26: Do not eat any meat with the blood still in it.</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 19:33-34: When an alien lives with you in your land, do not mistreat him. The alien living with you must be treated as one of your native-born. Love him as yourself, for you were aliens in Egypt.</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 20:10: If a man commits adultery with another man’s wife – with the wife of his neighbor – both the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death.</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 20:18: If a man lies with a woman during her monthly period and has sexual relations with her, he has exposed the source of her flow, and she has also uncovered it. Both of them must be cut off from their people.</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 20:27: A man or woman who is a medium or spiritist among you must be put to death. You are to stone them; their blood will be on their own heads.</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 19:16 Do not go about spreading slander among your people. Do not do anything that endangers your neighbor’s life.</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 19:18: Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people, but love your neighbor as yourself.</p>

<p>And I love these two:</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 20:15: If a man has sexual relations with an animal, he must be put to death, and you must kill the animal.</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 20:16: If a woman approaches an animal to have sexual relations with it, kill both the woman and the animal. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.</p>

<p>So a man must be put to death for <em>having</em> sex with an animal, but a woman must be put to death for <em>thinking</em> about having sex with an animal. Only a man would make such a law. No god would make such a distinction. And I guess the animal must be put to death in both cases because it is partly to blame for being so attractive that it causes humans to want to have sex with it.</p>
