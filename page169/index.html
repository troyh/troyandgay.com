          <p>Today they took DE “Bruce Davis”:http://www.nfl.com/draft/profiles/bruce-davis?id=1695, OT “Tony Hills”:http://www.nfl.com/draft/profiles/tony-hills?id=258 – finally an offensive lineman!, QB “Dennis Dixon”:http://www.nfl.com/draft/profiles/dennis-dixon?id=748, LB “Mike Humpal”:http://www.nfl.com/draft/profiles/mike-humpal?id=1367 and FS “Ryan Mundy”:http://www.nfl.com/draft/profiles/ryan-mundy?id=4393.</p>

<p>They took 3 offensive players and 4 defensive players. All seem like good picks and everyone seems to be excited about Rashard Mendenhall. But don’t they know they need to improve their offensive line? As one commenter I saw said after they picked a QB, “they’ve just added another tackling dummy.”</p>

        <article>
          <p>I seem to be on a religious trend here… we watched “For the Bible Tells Me Go”:http://www.netflix.com/Movie/For_the_Bible_Tells_Me_So/70059383?trkid=226870 last night. It’s a documentary about how people use the Bible to oppress non-whites and women. Now that they’ve largely given up on oppressing non-white and women because you look like a real lunatic doing that today, it’s the homosexuals’ turn. Falwell, Swaggert and James Dobson rile up their armies of hate to keep homosexuals out of society. And all make $100+ million a year, tax-free, doing it (What would Jesus think of that?).</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The most compelling reason Christians believe homosexuality is immoral is because, of course, the Bible says it is. They quote this:</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 18:22: Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.</p>

<p>And this:</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 20:13: If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.</p>

<p>But they stop reading there, because Leviticus goes on to say these things that Christians and their leaders regularly ignore:</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 19:27: Do not cut the hair at the sides of your head or clip off the edges of your beard.</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 19:26: Do not eat any meat with the blood still in it.</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 19:33-34: When an alien lives with you in your land, do not mistreat him. The alien living with you must be treated as one of your native-born. Love him as yourself, for you were aliens in Egypt.</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 20:10: If a man commits adultery with another man’s wife – with the wife of his neighbor – both the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death.</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 20:18: If a man lies with a woman during her monthly period and has sexual relations with her, he has exposed the source of her flow, and she has also uncovered it. Both of them must be cut off from their people.</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 20:27: A man or woman who is a medium or spiritist among you must be put to death. You are to stone them; their blood will be on their own heads.</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 19:16 Do not go about spreading slander among your people. Do not do anything that endangers your neighbor’s life.</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 19:18: Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people, but love your neighbor as yourself.</p>

<p>And I love these two:</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 20:15: If a man has sexual relations with an animal, he must be put to death, and you must kill the animal.</p>

<p>bq. Leviticus 20:16: If a woman approaches an animal to have sexual relations with it, kill both the woman and the animal. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.</p>

<p>So a man must be put to death for <em>having</em> sex with an animal, but a woman must be put to death for <em>thinking</em> about having sex with an animal. Only a man would make such a law. No god would make such a distinction. And I guess the animal must be put to death in both cases because it is partly to blame for being so attractive that it causes humans to want to have sex with it.</p>

          <p>They haven’t picked an offensive lineman, presumably because all the best linemen went to other teams ahead of them. They took a running back, Rashard Mendenhall, and a receiver, Limas Sweed.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Rashard Mendenhall: He looks like a big and fast running back, which is good, but don’t they need a power running back like Jerome Bettis or Franco Harris? Are they writing off Najeh Davenport already?</p>

<p>Limas Sweed: Since Roethlisberger is always throwing on the run, due to a lack of a good offensive line, a tall receiver like this guy should be easier to throw to.</p>

<p>We still need a boy’s name for our upcoming baby. Rashard? No. Limas? Mmmm, no. The search continues…</p>

          <p>Sometimes you see a story about America and you realize how ignorant some Americans are. The “story of an atheist who was harassed in the military”:http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/04/26/atheist.soldier.ap/index.html is one of those stories:</p>

<p>bq. Known as “the atheist guy,” Hall has been called immoral, a devil worshipper and – just as severe to some soldiers – gay, none of which, he says, is true. Hall even drove fellow soldiers to church in Iraq and paused while they prayed before meals.</p>

<p>Note that the author couldn’t just write that he’s not immoral, a devil-worshipper or gay, they had to qualify it with a “he says” because even the author of the story about prejudice isn’t quite sure if it’s possible for an atheist to be moral, straight and not believe in the devil.</p>

<p>It reminds me of my high school life in Virginia where other kids were shocked, shocked!, to find out I was an atheist. Most equated atheism to satanism and some were brave, or maybe stupid, enough to ask if I held “rituals” or believed that sacrificing animals or humans was okay. If I could keep from rolling my eyes, it was fun to answer “it depends on the person” and just stare at them. Ahh, high school, those were the days. There was even one football player, who was a big guy and much bigger than me, who I had been somewhat friends with, never talked to me after he found out I was an atheist and he admitted that he avoided me in the halls out of <em>fear</em>. Fear! Granted, that’s redneck-ville Virginia, but I bet most Americans have similar feelings today. According to Gallup polls, “that’s true”:http://atheism.about.com/od/atheistbigotryprejudice/a/AtheistSurveys.htm:</p>

<p>bq. 52% [of Americans] have a mostly unfavorable or worse attitude [towards atheists]</p>

<p>It turns out that atheists are the most hated minority in America. In fact, I’m more discriminated against than Scientologists! Oh well, at least I’m in good company. Here’s a list of famous atheists:</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln, Albert Einstein, Aldous Huxley, Andrew Carnegie, Ernest Hemingway, Arthur C. Clarke, Charles Darwin (duh!), Ayn Rand, Benjamin Franklin, Galileo, Leo Tolstoy, Kurt Vonnegut, John Lennon, Walt Disney, Frank Lloyd Wright, Alfred Hitchcock, George Orwell, Charles Schultz, Robert Heinlen, Mark Twain, Robert Frost, Susan B. Anthony, Vincent Van Gogh, Thomas Jefferson (woo hoo!), Thomas Edison, Thomas Paine, Ingmar Bergman, Sigmund Freud, Oscar Wilde, David Hume, Albert Camus, Brian Eno, Mike Mills, Michael Stipe, Robert Smith, Bob Odenkirk, Michael Lewis, Ian McKellen, Douglas Coupland, Warren Buffett, Douglas Adams, Howard Stern, Robin Quivers, Michael Crichton, Woody Allen, Linus Torvalds, Sarah Vowell, Noam Chomsky, John Malkovich, Frank Zappa, Salman Rushdie, Berkeley Breathed (former Vashon-Islander!), Ricky Gervais, Lance Armstrong, Isaac Asimov, Chumbawamba, Marlon Brando, Richard Branson, Isaac Brock and Peter Buck (that makes 75% of R.E.M.!) and, of course, Richard Dawkins.</p>

<p>The list goes “on and on and on”:http://www.celebatheists.com/?title=Main_Page…</p>
