          <p>It’s very encouraging news that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/02/09/tsunami.aid/index.html">the US will give another $600 million for the Tsunami aid</a> because even Wolfowitz realizes that it’s a great PR move: <em>“Above and beyond the humanitarian considerations – which would be compelling enough – we have an enormous interest in seeing this succeed,” Wolfowitz said, noting Indonesia’s status as both an “emerging democracy” and the world’s most populous Muslim country.”</em></p>

<p>I think the US Govt is finally starting to get it; a successful war on terror is 10% destruction and 90% education. Right now, we’re at 99% destruction and 1% education, but we’re going in the right direction.</p>

          <p>We all know that the Microsoft “settlement” (read: bowing to Bush’s fear of angering the wealthy) was essentially nothing. We knew it then and we know it now. But now Colleen Kollar-Kottelly and Microsoft’s lawyer are <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/02/09/HNmssettlementimpact_1.html">praising the settlement’s positive effects</a>. Right away, when the guilty part is happy with the settlement, you can be sure the settlement was toothless.</p>

<p>Why do they think it’s effective? <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a>. Firefox is proof that the settlement worked. No level playing-field, no open access to APIs, no dynamic market, none of the things they touted would happen after the settlement. After decades of Microsoft’s abuse of antitrust laws and of harming of consumers, we get a web browser as our prize. And we are to believe that the browser wouldn’t have existed without the settlement. I’m sure there are many people on the Mozilla team who would argue that.</p>

<p>But even if Firefox is the one thing that made the world a wonderful place and all was right in the industry again, here’s the simple version: Microsoft killed Netscape illegally, were convicted of it twice, and as a settlement, we get the browser born from Netscape as proof that all is wonderful. In other words, Microsoft killed someone and their punishment is that they have to allow that person’s child to live. And that child is our proof that justice works.</p>

<p>Is Firefox really a threat to Internet Explorer? Not according to Microsoft. In November of last year, after Firefox 1.0 was released, <a href="http://news.com.com/Microsoft+says+Firefox+not+a+threat+to+IE/2100-1032_3-5448719.html">Microsoft said that Firefox is not a threat to IE</a>. What did the 2002 settlement change in the last four months?</p>

          <p>I’ve been looking for a decent word processor to write documentation and it had to do at least HTML output, but preferably XML. I’ve been using Mozilla’s HTML editor, but wanted more of a word-processor. I considered OpenOffice, which does use XML as a file format, but on a Mac it runs within an X11 emulator. I don’t like emulators. Microsoft Word was out even if I could afford it because its XML is crazy proprietary. Then along came Apple’s <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/">Pages</a>, which does output in XML, the same open XML as OpenOffice, in fact. So I bought it for a mere $79 and got a <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/">presentation software package</a> to boot (imagine the beautiful presentations I can give to the dogs!).</p>

<p>Pages is the most amazing word processor I’ve ever seen… it’s a little slow even on my fairly speedy (dual 1.25GHz G4) PowerMac, but imagine PageMaker with a real word processor.  It’s what WYSIWYG was supposed to be. Word is a good word processor, but they should be ashamed that after 15 years they haven’t done much of anything to improve the writing experience (simultaneous spell-check was their only innovation and that was 10 years ago in Word 95).</p>

          <p>Weblogs, Inc founder, Jason Calacanis says that <a href="http://calacanis.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000443030938/">real entrepreneurs don’t raise venture capital</a>. I agree. Build your business with your own two hands, it’s more rewarding and fun. You learn a lot more which will help you in the later years of your business.</p>

<p>BTW, notice the Google ads on the top of the page – they’re all for VCs. I think that proves Jason’s point.</p>
