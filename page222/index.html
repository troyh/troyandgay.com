<p>After <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=2985">our previous surprise mention</a>, the food editor for the Washington Post called to interview us (Gay does all the talking for us, as you’d expect) and the  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62485-2005Mar1.html">the follow-up article</a> on <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> ran in today’s edition:</p>

<p><em>“We wanted to make eating easier through technology,” Gilmore says. Recipezaar.com accomplishes that goal by offering free features such as personalized online cookbooks and automatic shopping lists of ingredients. Often the recipes come with good-quality photos.</em></p>

<p>I grew up in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=2740%20viking%20drive%2C%20herndon%2C%20va%20">the Washington, DC area</a> so it’s nice that my hometown newspaper (finally) recognized me. ;)</p>

            <p><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/mstamper77/CoolStuff%20folder/CoolStuff/">Gui Avoider</a> explains why they are more productive on a Mac. I have to agree, as a long-time Mac-hater (I still think pre-OS X Macs sucked), the first thing that struck me about OS X is that I think about what I’m doing rather than how I’m doing it. Windows and Linux GUIs are both so difficult to use that I find myself struggling with the tool rather than getting the job done. OS X is a pleasure to use, and I don’t say that about many tech products.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Several weeks ago, we started using <a href="http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/">Ganglia</a> to monitor all our servers. And I’m glad I did. For years we used a home-made system built on <a href="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/sebastien.godard/">sysstat</a> and <a href="http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/">RRDTool</a> and it served its purpose, but then I discovered Ganglia. Our old system gave us performance statistics on a 10-minute delay but Ganglia is almost live, which is very helpful to see what’s happening <em>now</em>. It’s also much easier to setup, just apt-get ganglia-monitor, edit the /etc/gmond.conf file (if necessary) and a new server is being monitored. It’s that easy (if you use <a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a>).</p>

<p>Ganglia was originally funded by the place I interned for while in college (and, not coincidentally, my dad’s employer for 25 years), the <a href="http://nsf.gov">National Science Foundation</a>. That’s good government at work! :)</p>
