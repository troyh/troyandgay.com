        <article>
          <p>Friday’s (first) beer was “Anderson Valley’s Hop Ottin’ IPA”:http://www.avbc.com/beers/ipa.html, a doubly hoppy and cloudy beer that went well with the sunny evening. I was surprised at how cloudy it was, I was expecting to find yeast still in it but there wasn’t any.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2538329243/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3143/2538329243_d71426f5ce.jpg" alt="Anderson Valley Hop Ottin' IPA" /></a></p>

<p>After that, I had an “Alaskan ESB”:http://www.alaskanbeer.com/esb.html, which we have plenty of in the fridge after “Havana’s 1st birthday party”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/03/havanas-1st-birthday-party/. This was the first one I had and, maybe Alaskan beers are ho-hum to me, it was surprisingly tasty and much more clear than the IPA.</p>

          <p>Mark and Lee are still in Seattle after celebrating “Lee’s birthday in Vancouver”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/18/vancouver-3/ so we had them and Eric over for dinner tonight. We had crab cakes, salmon dip, a leg of lamb, a mango salad, cheesecake for dessert and wine, of course. All the food was made by Gay (I barbecued the lamb, though) and all was very good.</p>

          <p>I saw this site several days ago and keep remembering it. “Christopher Huet”:http://www.christophehuet.com/ does some amazing art. Some of it I like, some it scares me. I really like this one, though:</p>

<p>He even did the music on the site, which is also very good.</p>

          <p>Havana has discovered the slide:</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/troyh/2533723093/">video</a> on Flickr (or click photo above). She likes to crawl up it and in bare feet she can climb almost all the way up it until it gets more steep.</p>

<p>A new word she’s learned is “Up” that she uses when she wants to be picked up, helped up onto something or out of her highchair. But she says “Bup”. The bottom of the slide is too high for her to get on it (fortunately), so she stands at the bottom, looks at you and says “Bup”.</p>
