              <p>For our 4th wedding anniversary present to ourselves, we got photos of Illy and Ouzo put on canvas (“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giclee prints">giclée</a>”). We had them stretched on wooden frames and we hung them today:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2757978358/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3051/2757978358_dc6cdf43a2.jpg" alt="Illy painting" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2757978752/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2339/2757978752_c9115eed2c.jpg" alt="Ouzo painting" /></a></p>

<p>These are photos taken during our wedding. Illy was wearing white pearls and Ouzo was wearing a white bowtie. They’re both great photos taken by our wedding photographer, <a href="http://www.rebeccadouglas.com/">Rebecca Douglas</a>.</p>

<p>They were put on the biggest walls in the house, walls that were begging for some art. We couldn’t find anything we liked. Gay had the idea to have some of our own photos blown up as art. We love our dogs and having photos of our dogs on our walls seems more personal to us than any art we may find.</p>

<p>The photos are posted on Flickr (click them to see the bigger versions):</p>

              <p>Monday morning we were back on I-90 heading home:</p>

<p>Havana enjoys a good book and a snack:</p>

              <p>The Connolly’s had a brunch on Sunday where Havana had one of her few exposures to a ton of kids:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2730594606/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3266/2730594606_21bb93e7e1.jpg" alt="Havana at Connolly's play room" /></a></p>

<p>She held onto her doll and seemed shocked by all the activity. Frankly, it was a bit too much for me as well. Note to self: stop short of 12 kids.</p>

<p>After brunch, we drove out to Grandma’s farm where Havana met some animals:</p>

              <p>The “Dry Fly Distillery”:http://dryflydistilling.com/ is the only distillery in Washington State. They’ve been in business a year and we visited and got a tour from the co-owner. They make vodka and gin right now and will be coming out with a whiskey later this year and a bourbon next year. Most gins are made with juniper berries and maybe one more ingredient, they put several spices in their gin, including hops. Everything they use is grown in Washington State.</p>

<p>I even got to bottle some gin and put the labels on it:</p>

<p>Because I did such a great job bottling, they gave me a free t-shirt. We bought a bottle of gin and vodka and will try a martini as soon as we get home.</p>
