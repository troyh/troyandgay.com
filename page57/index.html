            <p>The Seattle Times published <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/pacificnw/2014828752_pacificpcapitolhill01.html?syndication=rss">an article</a> about our new neighborhood, about how it used to be filled with large Catholic families. It’s a bit overly-nostalgic for the “good ol’ days”, as if good childhoods are a thing of the past. </p>

<p>The Mona mentioned in the article is a teacher at the preschool we want to get Hudson into. And I can see the dome of the <a href="http://www.holynames-sea.org/">Holy Names Academy</a>, which is a beautiful building, from my office window.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Havana’s 4 years old today. It’s hard for me to believe 4 years have passed already. </p>

<p>I hope you read this years from now (and I hope I’m still around when you do):</p>

<p>Havana, I’m amazed how much you change and grow up so quickly. It seems just recently you could barely walk or talk and today you ask me to chase you around the house and you have actual conversations with me about your day. You talk a lot  about how you can’t wait to grow up and get bigger. I wish you’d grow up slower – soon, I won’t be able to carry you or lift you over my head and you won’t even want me to carry you on my shoulders or ride on my back like you’re riding an elephant.</p>

<p>You’re a great big sister to Hudson (and I’m sure you will be to Eva too), you’ve taught him a lot and, you don’t realize this and won’t believe it when you read this, but he rarely refuses you, always listens to everything you say, mimics everything you do and looks up to you. If only you could finish potty-training him because we can’t seem to.</p>

<p>Four years ago, you were a challenge that I didn’t think I could handle, and sometimes you still are today, and you prove almost daily how unprepared I am to be a dad. Nevertheless, I’m glad I’m your dad and I’ll always do what I can to help you have a happy life.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We took our bouncy house to Havana’s school today and Gay made cupcakes so she could celebrate her birthday with her school friends. She likes butterflies, or “papillons”, so she requested “butterfly cupcakes”. Gay had to get creative:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5665592227/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5230/5665592227_94a0abdc7b.jpg" alt="IMG_6709" /></a></p>

<p>Everyone sang “Happy Birthday” to her in French and then they ate their cupcakes. Then we all went outside to play in the bouncy house for an hour. That tired them all out and there were only a couple injuries and crying kids, which is pretty good.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>The sauna heater arrived at our house this week so we took that with us to the new house this morning to do some work. The security company installed the new monitoring devices (motion detectors, door contacts, smoke detectors) on Monday and Tuesday and we had our electrician install the cameras. I wish we had our electrician install the motion detectors and door contacts too because they ran new wiring, which I didn’t expect, and didn’t run it in conduit so it doesn’t look as cool in the exposed basement ceiling as all the other electrical does. We will have to have our electrician re-run that wiring. </p>

<p>Nancy and My came to look at more paint colors for interior and exterior. They’re almost done with all the color selections but are having trouble picking a few colors so asked for yet more paint samples to be done. They’ve done, I think, 8 samples for the living room alone and aren’t happy with any of them. They also guided the install of mock-up chandeliers in the main staircase. The carpenters built three mock-ups of the lights we’re going to get and needed to know where the wiring for them needed to be installed in the ceiling above. Mark climbed a tall ladder to mount temporary brackets on the ceiling with clamps and hang each of the lights and adjust their height.</p>

<p>I hooked up the DVR for the security cameras while Bill, the electrician, adjusted the cameras – he even had to fix one that arrived non-functional. I also assembled the cabinet for all the audio/video equipment in the house so that’s ready to go when I start the trim-out work for the audio/video equipment next month. </p>

<p>We did a walk-through with Bill to finalize all the light switches and outlets that we need to get. We’re buying all of those ourselves to avoid the P&amp;O charge from the contractor. They and the sub-contractors have been very good about letting us buy things like that (plumbing fixtures, appliances, door hardware, etc) and delivering it to them for installation. We also planned electrical and lighting for the garage with Bill.</p>

<p>The cabinetry installers were there installing the faces on my closet cabinetry and Gay’s closet cabinetry is almost all installed too. Tile was being installed in the guest bath. A new wall panel was built and installed in the dining room to match the rest of the walls; the wall between the kitchen and dining room was almost completely removed but there’s a short length of wall remaining and needed to match the rest of the room’s wood wainscoting. A new basement mudroom door was also installed.</p>

<p>Next week, the new doors for the family room will be delivered and installed, which I’m looking forward to and want to be there to watch those get installed. The door jambs alone are 700 lbs so Mark is planning to use a crane to lift them. Hudson would love to see that, I bet!</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Since <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/04/21/pioneer-millworks/">we couldn’t use the wood from Pioneer Millworks</a>, we drove down to Tacoma this morning to visit <a href="http://www.rhinedemolition.com/">Rhine Demolition</a>, a stockpiler of reclaimed wood to look for a replacement. We quickly found some Douglas Fir planks that looked like the wood we wanted to use, but this was all very uniform, rather than the random stuff Pioneer Millworks sent. Better yet, it is reclaimed wood from the old <a href="http://www.vintageseattle.org/2007/08/07/profile-rainier-cold-storage-buildings-pt-1/">Rainier Cold Storage Stock House</a> that was <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lintmachine/2207917698/">partially demolished</a> in 2008. That building was part of the brewery built by Andrew Hemrich, the founder of Seattle Brewing &amp; Malting Company (that <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/02/18/two-breweries/">we photo’d in February</a>) and the builder and original owner of our house. Months ago, while looking in an antique shop in Georgetown, I told Gay it’d be great if we could find something from the old brewery to put in the house. We finally did. We’re also going to get some bigger pieces of wood to build our basement bar top and possibly our dining table and office desks. The history is coming full circle; I think Andrew Hemrich would be happy.</p>

<p>On our way to the house, we stopped at <a href="http://www.99bottles.net/">99 Bottles</a>, a beer store I’ve been meaning to visit for a year or two, but never find myself in Federal Way. It’s a nice shop, similar to my favorite Beer Junction in West Seattle, with a great selection and friendly owners. I got beers for the fridge and some cold beers to bring to the guys at the house for Friday beers. After a diaper change for Eva and a stop at Starbucks for a quick lunch, we trekked back up to Seattle.</p>

<p>I met a new Schuchart/Dow guy, Tim the Tool Guy (he loves old tools and buys and restores them to working condition), who was there finishing up the trim around windows. The floor sub-contractor started installing the Ipê wood in the family room this morning and were just about finished when we arrived, the sauna arrived this morning unexpectedly a week early, most of the security cameras have been installed, Gay’s closet cabinetry is mostly installed (she’s excited!), they built the woodwork around the opening between the kitchen and dining room which replicates the original woodwork and the steel frame for the wall in the attic is done and waiting for the track system to arrive and be installed next week.</p>

<p>We had beers with the guys and admired the new wood floor in the family room that just looks great. I’m really happy with how that turned out, even better than I was expecting.</p>

<p>We looked at a sample of the grout in the kitchen floor. The interior designers, when asked to select a color from two big palettes of grout colors, couldn’t find one they liked so they asked to mix two colors. And the colors are from two different grout manufacturers. The tile guys did it, but they keep telling us that it’s not a good idea to mix grout from two different manufacturers. I think they’re right, so we should pick a single color. There’s a couple colors that look just fine to me, but that’s why I’m not an interior designer, I guess.</p>

<p>Nancy and My also requested a bunch more colors for the living room. They just can’t find a color they like that brings out the color in the wood in that room. Again, I look at all those samples and am glad I don’t have to pick colors. I feel bad for the painting contractor having to keep coming back and putting yet more samples on the walls.</p>

<p>We called in dinner takeout at <a href="http://www.kokorasgreekgrill.com/">Kokoras</a>, missed the 4:40p ferry but caught the 5p ferry back home.</p>
