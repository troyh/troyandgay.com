        <article>
          <p>Gay met with the interior designers for round 2 of their plans. After <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/03/03/furniture-fabrics/">the first round</a>, we felt we were pretty far away from something we liked. But this one is much closer. We still need to find out how much some of the things cost before committing to them and we need to convince ourselves that some of the furniture is worth the price, but for the most part, we like the paint colors, fabrics and most of the furniture.</p>

<p>She also met with the landscape designer to see round 2 of that. Again, we’re very close to finishing that design. We need to get a better idea of the cost of things and make some minor adjustments.</p>

<p>She also saw the fireplace installed and talked to the tile guy about laying out the kitchen tile. No decision is simple; deciding where the full tiles should be and where the partial tiles should be in the room is always a trade-off and the tile guy doesn’t quite agree with the interior designers, so the decision ends up with us.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Kelly could work late to watch the kids so we could go out to dinner for <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/03/22/happy-birthday-gay-4/">Gay’s birthday</a>. We left at 1pm, went to the house to check on progress and then to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=roche+bobois+seattle&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=roche+bobois&amp;hnear=Seattle,+WA&amp;cid=1891254643517170645">Roche-Bobois</a> downtown to look at a sectional that the designers suggested. We checked out a couple other furniture stores near there and then made our way to <a href="http://www.tavernlaw.com/">Tavern Law</a> for a drink before dinner.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I made a reservation at <a href="http://www.spinasse.com/">Cascina Spinasse</a> for 6:30p and they stressed to me that they can’t hold a reservation so we had to be there promptly at 6:30p. A couple days earlier, I had secretly emailed some of Gay’s friends telling them they can meet us at Tavern Law at 5:30 for a drink if they were nearby. I didn’t know how long we’d be at the bar, so I was worried it’d be hard to make our reservation on time. That turned out to be true, we ended up staying at the bar with everyone until after 7.</p>

<p>Gay was surprised to see her friends showing up and some of her friends were surprised it was a surprise. I’m terrible at planning Gay’s birthdays because my ideal birthday (actually, my ideal day) is having a quiet dinner at home but Gay likes to be out and about celebrating with people. Reid, Marissa, Megan, Jon, Stephanie, Matt and Renuka all made it and we practically filled the tiny place. Technically, Alex and Niles made it too, but they misread my confusing mail and showed up the previous night (and emailed me asking where we were).</p>

<p>For dinner, We ended up just walking up the street to <a href="http://www.barriorestaurant.com/">Barrio</a>, which we saw on our way to Tavern Law and liked the looks of the place – big steel doors, thick wood tables, etc. This place has a very cool interior with an amazing wall of candles (that apparently takes 45 minutes to light). As we sat down, Kelly texted Gay and said that Havana and Hudson both had diarrhea so Gay was anxious about that, but Kelly assured her that they’re fine. We had a good dinner and made the 10:20p ferry home.</p>

          <p>Gay turned 41 today. It’s the first time since 2008 that we celebrated her birthday at home. I made dinner tonight and we’re going out to dinner tomorrow night.</p>

<p>She’s more wise, more fun and more beautiful than the day I met her. I met her just before she turned 27. She was successful and a powerful personality at Microsoft then, a difficult thing in a male-dominant environment like Microsoft at the time, and I loved her confidence and ability to make things happen. 14 years later, she’s my wife, business/career partner and the mother to my 3 kids. It’s been a great time for me (less so for her, I’m sure) and I hope it lasts another 80 years.</p>

          <p>Eva is 3 months old today. She’s still a good baby, eating regularly, sleeping well and surviving her brother and sister. She now hates wet diapers and complains until they’re changed. She is starting baby talk, saying “Ga”, and smiles at faces.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>We’re putting reclaimed wood on a wall of cabinetry and on our office doors. Schuchart/Dow used <a href="http://pioneermillworks.com/">Pioneer Millworks</a> to order the wood a few weeks ago. Last week, we decided to not use it on the office doors because it’s too difficult to assemble doors out of it and mount it to track system – the labor to assemble and install the doors would triple the cost. So Schuchart/Dow called Pioneer Millworks to cancel 30% of the order (the amount for the doors) and they told them that they would charge us a 20% restocking fee for the cancellation. 20% is high, but the wood hasn’t even left their warehouse yet, so there’s no reason to charge a restocking fee at all! They don’t have to deal with handling a return, verifying that they received what they’re supposed to, deal with damage, etc. It felt like a threat to keep us from canceling an order they’ve booked more than a legitimate fee.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>Schuchart/Dow told them what we thought of that restocking fee but they held their ground, so I decided I’d deal directly with them myself and got the salesman’s contact info. I called him today, he answered his phone and when he realized who I was and why I was calling, he told me that he was in a meeting and had to call me back. So a stranger’s call is important enough to interrupt a meeting but an existing customer isn’t. It’s better to <em>not</em> be a customer of Pioneer Millworks, apparently.</p>

<p>He called me back an hour later and told me this order is a small order and they’re only handling the order as “a favor” (his words) to Schuchart/Dow. Oh, I see: He doesn’t really want our money and doesn’t want us as a customer, he’s just doing it as a favor to someone else. What a saint. And if he’s so eager to please Schuchart/Dow, why’d he give them such a hard time about the restocking fee?</p>

<p>And I doubt that he’s being honest about it being a small order to them. It’s about 300 square feet of wood. I’m sure they do much larger orders, but <a href="http://pioneermillworks.com/galleries/residential-gallery">their web site gallery</a> has plenty of examples that are of similarly-sized and smaller orders. To his credit, he agreed to not charge the restocking fee, but a good salesperson would have said “We want our customers to be happy and we appreciate your business, so I’m going to waive the restocking fee.” But he said, effectively, “I want you to understand that I’m not doing this to please you, my customer and the person paying me, I’m doing this to please someone else.”</p>
