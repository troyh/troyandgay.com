              <p>The movers came today to pack everything into boxes, now our house is full of boxes. Someone else came to disassemble the gym equipment. We had Indian takeout for dinner with the two packing people as our last dinner on our last night on Vashon with a beautiful view of Mt Rainier. </p>

              <p>They’ve got just a few more days until we move in. Paint touch-up is being done and the painters have begun the exterior trim painting. Kurt and Tim are finishing the base shoe trim on the staircase. Colin framed the theater cabinetry. Erich was cleaning the cross-ties in the attic. Ryan was installing more door hardware. I did a little more trim-out of the low-voltage work. DirecTV installed the satellite dish. Bill called in sick Tuesday (July 4th hangover?) but he has some light fixtures to install this week and finish up some electrical trim-out. The stone guys were doing something, not sure what. The replacement beverage fridge arrived today. And the cleaners arrived and started cleaning the living spaces for us.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Left to do: Exterior trim paint, the last of the decorative steel installation in family room, theater and master bath, some plumbing fixture work in master bath, master bath shower door hardware and glass still has to be selected (waiting on samples), cut and installed, replacement master bath toilet and all the A/V equipment has to arrive and get installed, the kitchen pantry door hardware has to be made and installed, the fireplace surround stone has to be selected, cut and installed.</p>

<p>Furniture will start arriving this week and next, but some will take until October to arrive.</p>

<p>It’s a busy week. The movers came to the Vashon house to pack everything up. Tomorrow they’ll come back and load everything on the trucks and bring the trucks to the new house. We’ll go over with them tomorrow afternoon for our first official night in the house. Friday, the movers will unload the trucks and move everything into the house.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>So as not to miss a stage of the Tour de France during our move, I scheduled DirecTV to install the dish at the new house today so Gay and I went over there to meet the installer. We didn’t want the dish to be installed in a place that would be visible from the street and DirecTV installers tend to want to install the dish in the most-accessible location, which is usually a terrible location if you care at all about how your house looks. The installer, Michael, got there 5 or 10 minutes before we did, so I think he started off annoyed, as if promising to arrive “sometime between 8am and 12pm” is courteous. I like DirecTV, their customer support and I got to become friends with the guy who came out to Vashon from time-to-time, so I was optimistic that this would go well.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I walked Michael around and explained what I wanted: the dish installed and the cables ran into the basement where I can hook everything. Right off the bat he was looking for reasons to not do the work. He said the boxes can’t be installed in the basement, that they have to be installed near TVs, which is not true. He claimed he can’t finish the job without a TV available – why don’t DirecTV installers carry small $50 TVs with them, surely I’m not the first to get DirecTV installed in a new house that doesn’t yet have TVs? I told him that we’d go run to Best Buy and buy a little TV for him to use while he was installing the dish on the roof. That foiled his plan to do no work for now. I even told him that he wouldn’t have to drill a hole in the house or even attach the cable to the house as we’d have our electrician do that for him.</p>

<p>We walked around back to look for a location. He immediately decided that eave on the southwest corner of the house was the best, and later, <em>only</em>, location to install the dish. I explained that putting it there would make it very visible and we didn’t want that. I pointed out a couple good locations on the roof and he had excuses for those:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It’s too high for his ladder. I pointed out the extensive scaffolding surrounding the entire house that he could use to get to the roof.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scaffolding makes it more difficult to run the coax cable. I’d think it’d make it easier, but he said “Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn’t”. What? Open your eyes and look at the scaffolding in front of you, is this one of those easier times or harder times?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it goes on the roof, any future service calls on the dish would require a long ladder when the scaffolding is not there. Mark pointed to the dormer with a big window right next to the location, which would make access easy without a ladder. He argued that DirecTV installers are not allowed to go on roofs without a ladder, citing OSHA regulations. I don’t know OSHA’s rules, so I can’t argue, but it seems dubious.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggested putting it on the garage roof, which is much lower and easier to access. He said the house was in the way of the line-of-sight to the satellite (in geo-synchronous orbit over Texas). I asked if he could verify that with his tool he showed me to test for line-of-sight access. He didn’t want to do that.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, it was clear to me that he just didn’t want to do it at all so I asked him if that was the case. He said it was. While Gay, Mark and I talked about our options (buy a dish and get a 3rd party installer or just use Comcast cable TV), he just walked away and left without saying anything.</p>

<p>I called DirecTV and explained what happened. They were apologetic and promised to send out a supervisor to give a second opinion. I explained that we were only there today and I really didn’t want to miss a day of the Tour de France. The customer support rep was understanding and promised to get this done as quickly as possible. An hour later, they called me back and told me a supervisor would check it today. An hour later, the supervisor showed up. He was much more friendly and interested in finding a good location. He thought it could be installed on the roof, but he thought the garage would be fine for line-of-sight – he didn’t even need to use a test tool. We quickly marked out a path for the cable to the basement, he made a call and said an installer would be out this afternoon to install it.</p>

<p>At 3:30pm, a new installer showed up, Miguel, and again, was much more friendly and interested in doing the work. Mark and I showed him the locations and he immediately went to work installing the dish and running the cable. By 4:30, he was done. Had we gotten Miguel this morning, we’d have been done by 6 hours earlier. And best of all, the dish is not even on the house and is completely invisible unless you stand in the alley in front of the garage. It’s also very accessible for me to clean snow off the dish after the unusual Seattle snowstorms.</p>

<p>I still don’t know if it’s working since we don’t yet have a TV, but Miguel gave us his mobile number and promised to come back when the TV arrives to make sure it works.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>An inspection for our Vashon house was scheduled for this afternoon and takes 4-5 hours, so we decided to go visit the house for the afternoon. Gay took the kids to French camp and Gay and I took the ferry over to Seattle to the house. Kelly picked the kids up at noon and took them over to meet us at the house.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5886066101/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5028/5886066101_49cbaff5a6.jpg" alt="IMG_3366" /></a></p>

<p>Kelly took the kids to the park a couple blocks away and Gay helped me with the in-ceiling speakers. We took down all the speakers to put a piece of insulation behind each speaker, as recommended by the Noble Fidelity engineer to improve the bass (and provides some noise insulation to the floor above). In-ceiling speaker makers need to come up with an easier mounting system because it’s a two-person job – one person has to hold the speaker while the other attaches the wires, guides the wire into the hole and screws it in. It’s difficult to have two people on ladders right next to each other (although it’s nicer when it’s your wife that close to you) and it’s tiring to hold a speaker above your head, which is made worse by how delicate they are and a lack of comfortable handles. It’d be handy if the speakers had mounting brackets that held the speaker in place and allowed it to drop down freeing your hands to work the way some canned lighting housings do.</p>

<p>There’s lots of miscellaneous work going on at the house. Cabinetry hardware is still being installed, only some of which has arrived. Most of the kitchen pulls are going to be very late as they take 10-12 weeks to make after they’re ordered and we only ordered them last week. So we’ll have blue tape as pulls on most of the kitchen cabinetry for a couple months. I got to use my closet cabinetry since that hardware is all installed. The big hanging pullouts and mirror work great and are easy to pull out and push in.</p>

<p>All the appliances are installed and we got to play with the stove. One beverage fridge in the butler’s pantry was DOA, so the replacement will be delivered and installed next week. The washer and dryer are installed – those are nice-looking! The closet shelving and hardware is all installed in every room. The steel was put on the moving wall in the attic. The sliding doors are all painted – those just need bumpers to be installed on the tracks to keep them from hitting the edges and walls. All the fixtures are installed in the kitchen and bathrooms but there’s still a little bit of plumbing work to be done here and there. The basement shower glass was installed, with a cut-out handle that turned out well, so as to avoid having a pull on the glass. All the toilets are installed, except the master bath one that was cracked, so we’ll be missing a toilet in the master for a while. The kitchen tile and the master bath tile are all done and grouted. The master vanities are being constructed and should be done by move-in day but it looks like the decorative steel will be  late. The decorative steel in the pantry is installed. The garage doors were installed, except for one opener that they didn’t have in stock (oddly, it’s the standard one, not the more rare jackshaft one), so I got to open and close it – smooth and quiet. Bill finished all the electrical and put really cool industrial light fixtures throughout the garage. The floor guys arrived in the afternoon to put the final coat on all the stairs.</p>

<p>Next week is a short week but will be busy finishing all the loose ends. I think we’re going to have people still running through the house for a couple weeks after we move in. Then the exterior work can begin and, since I’ll be living there, maybe I can do some work on the decks.</p>

<p>On the way to the house, we stopped at The Beer Junction to get some beer to stock the newly-installed fridge. At the end of the day, we had a beer with Mark while admiring all the progress. Thanks to the beer, I also got to use one of the <a href="http://www.totousa.com/Neorest/Neorest550.aspx">Toto Neorest</a> toilets for the first time; never having to touch a toilet to use it makes you wonder why it took so long – why should people have to touch the most unsanitary object in their house? 7 days until move-in, we’re getting excited!</p>

<p>On the way home, we went to Talarico’s for pizza dinner. Hudson missed his usual nap so was very tired and fell asleep minutes after leaving the restaurant while Havana watched Toy Story 2 on the iPad.</p>
