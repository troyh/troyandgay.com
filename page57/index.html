          </h3>
            <p>Eva is 4 months old today. She is starting to grab and hold things, smiles more and giggles when her neck is tickled. She’s not yet sleeping through the night regularly, although she’s done it a couple times. But she’s eating a lot and has some trouble napping during the day, so she must be on a growth spurt.</p>

<p>Havana and Hudson still play with her, usually too roughly. Havana can gently put her pacifier back in her mouth when it falls out, which is handy. And Havana complains that Eva gets “all the tenshun”. Every night Hudson gives good-night kisses and always says “Eva first!”</p>

<p>My mother still refuses to pronounce and spell her name correctly.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>They’ve installed the cabinetry in my closet. I haven’t yet seen it in person but Mark texted me this morning about it and then Gay went to the house today and took this video of it. </p>

<p>[flickr video=5636453118 secret=9a3f3e4182]</p>

<p>I designed 2 pull-out cabinets to maximize the space I had (Gay got a much bigger closet than I did).  In the 4 feet of wall space, I could fit 12 linear feet of hanging space instead of of just 8 linear feet by turning the cabinets 90°, which requiring a pull-out hardware design. My closet has a window in it so these pull-outs also protect my clothes from the sun. The interior designers did me one better by throwing a pull-out mirror in between them! Gay says it’s really nice and I can’t wait to go see it.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Gay and I went to the annual auction for Hudson’s preschool co-op. This one was much better than the event <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2010/04/17/preschool-auction/">last year</a> – <a href="http://www.openspacevashon.com/">the venue</a> was better and the food was better. Gay didn’t have to be a cashier this year either, so she got to actually be at the event. We did have to do a little work to take the auction items off the tables as each phase of the silent auction ended.</p>

<p>We bid on a few things but only won one: a beer and chocolate pairing with <a href="http://www.theochocolate.com/">Theo Chocolate</a>.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We’re working on getting our house on the market and that required that we replace the failing windows. We’re replacing 13 of them, some worse than others, and 5 of them were done today. They would have done all of them but they mis-measured 8 of them (identical ones) so they arrived with windows that were too big. </p>

<p>The lucky new owner is going to get lots of brand new windows.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We went to the house this morning to check on progress. The cabinetry, tile and wood trim is still being installed and we saw paint samples that <a href="http://www.nbdesigngroup.net/">Nancy and My</a> had the painters do. Some more were being done when we arrived. It sounds like they’ve finalized most of the colors.

<p>We also checked on the exterior fog coat sample, this time didn’t include a bonding agent, as <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/04/08/long-friday-at-the-house/">we discussed last week</a> with Ryan, Mark and Katie. We’re trying to avoid using a bonding agent. We tried to wash it off with a garden hose and it did appear to come off a little, which implies it won’t adhere to the aggregate in the stucco. Nancy is going to try to find a color that will match or complement the grey/white color of the aggregate so when it does wash off the aggregate, it will look natural.</p>

<p>We hadn’t had lunch and were too hungry to wait for dinner so we went to <a href="http://seriouspiewestlake.com/">the new Serious Pie</a> for an appetizer and a beer – <a href="http://www.schoonerexact.com/">Schooner Exact</a>’s pale ale, which we’ve never had – while we waited for takeout pizzas. I love the new Serious Pie; it still has communal tables but it’s much bigger and in a better location, also closer to our house. It also appears more kid-friendly so I’m looking forward to taking the kids there often. Havana and Hudson even liked the egg pizza (my favorite!), which I didn’t expect.</p>

<p>On the way to the ferry, we stopped at <a href="http://www.thebeerjunction.com/">The Beer Junction</a> to re-stock the fridge with beers (and I picked up an <a href="http://www.ommegang.com/">Ommegang</a> glass), and then back home.</p>
