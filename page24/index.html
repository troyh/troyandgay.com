<p>I was skeptical that these new  Spiegelau glasses, which were supposedly designed for drinking <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Pale_Ale">IPAs</a> but <a href="http://beerpulse.com/2013/02/dogfish-head-statement-confirms-that-ipa-glass-stemmed-from-riedel-o-glass/">that’s not true</a>, were better than my favorite Spiegelau tulip glass but when they dropped to a low price of $10/ea I bought them. We tasted the same beer in both glasses and the IPA glass did have a noticeably more flavorful and less bitter taste. Firestone’s Union Jack has always had too much of a grapefruit bitterness for me but I liked it in the IPA glass. I still don’t like the look or the lack of a stem but I’ll use them anyway. In fact, I bought two more!</p>

            <p>Do my crying underwater,
I can’t get down any farther.
All my drowning friends can see,
Now there is no running from it.
It’s become the crux of me,
I wish that I could rise above it.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Everyday I start so great,
then the sunlight dims.
The less I’ve learned, the more I see
the pythons and the limbs.
Do not know what’s wrong with me,
sours in the cup.
When I walk into a room,
I do not light it up.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Tiny bubbles hang above me.
It’s a sign that someone loves me.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Oh, don’t tell anyone I’m here
I’ve got Tylenol and beer</p>

            <p>We were walking around Capitol Hill with our real estate agents this morning and happened to decide to sit and talk at Elysian and found that the <a href="http://www.brewdog.com/blog-article/brewdogs-tv-show">Brew Dogs TV show</a> was filming there. We’ll see if we make it into the episode.</p>

            <p>After getting the kids off to school, Gay and I drove to Canby, Oregon to visit JVNW. We stopped in Clackamas for lunch at a McMenamin’s (in a strip mall!) with Kevin, our brewer, and then met with the guys at JVNW. It was fun to see the factory, the design and project management areas and then walk through the construction of the tanks at various stages.   </p>

<p>We all then went to <a href="http://laurelwoodbrewpub.com/">Laurelwood</a> in Portland to talk and then Gay and I checked into our hotel before dinner at Higgins. Not sure why, but <a href="http://www.thenines.com/?PS=PS_aa_WWC_WestWestCanada_Google_BD_The_Nines_Portland_Exact_060811_NAD_FM">the hotel</a> upgraded us to the Meier-Frank suite – woulda been even more great if we stayed more than one night.</p>

            <p>We ordered it over 2 months ago and picked up our Mini Countryman today. It was a struggle, but we fit 3 car seats in it and took the kids out for a drive around town and then to dinner in Columbia City. This is the first non-black car I’ve owned of the five since 1995. I’ve wanted a Mini since they came out in 2002, I just needed them to make a 4-door model.</p>
