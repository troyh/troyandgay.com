<a href="http://troyandgay.com/2009/12/09/eric-valerie-in-cabo/">Eric &amp; Valerie</a> are in town for a few days, visiting from France, so they had a get-together at <a href="http://bastilleseattle.com">Bastille</a> in Ballard. Since Ballard is hard to get to for us, we thought we’d visit our friend Robyn who is building her brewery in Ballard, <a href="http://www.stoupbrewing.com">Stoup Brewing Co</a>. Their equipment was delivered a couple weeks ago and they’re still setting it up, getting the boiler and chiller installed and building cold rooms and their tasting room. A block away is <a href="http://reubensbrews.com">Reuben’s Brews</a>, so we stopped over there for some sampler beers.</p>

<p>Then we went to Bastille for dinner and drinks with Eric, Valerie and a bunch of people we rarely see these days.</p>

            <p>After months of our failing to get Eva interested, at 2.63 years old, she started potty-training today using the book <em>Toilet Training in Less Than a Day</em> – even though it was originally published in 1974, it does <em>not</em> advise you to spank your kid until they figure it out. </p>

<p>She went #1 successfully <del>4</del> <del>5</del> 6 times today, #2 once and no accidents. She is very proud of herself and so are we.</p>

            <p>Several weeks ago, just a few weeks after <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2013/05/23/mini-countryman/">we got it</a>, Gay broke the Mini when she opened her door in a residential neighborhood and a car ran right into the door, bending it forward. Only the Mini and the other car were hurt, fortunately. </p>

<p>It’s been in the repair shop ever since waiting on a special tool, called a <a href="http://www.celette-uk.co.uk/">Celette</a>, that BMW requires to repair damage to the frame. We still don’t know when it will be done. </p>
