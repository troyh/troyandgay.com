<p>He’s four weeks old now. So far, he’s been a great baby, much easier to take care of than Havana was. From what we understood, Havana was a very good baby so I was not expecting to be so lucky the second time. And with a 16 month-old and a newborn, we expected to have our hands full and to be hating it at this point.</p>

<p>But that’s not the case at all. Gay has to wake up every hour or two at night to feed him, of course, and some nights are better than others. Generally though, he’s very quiet and keeps to himself. I can even bottle-feed him already. I think that makes Gay happy. Havana let me do that maybe twice in total, but I’ve fed him twice in just the last few days. I can even get him to calm down and sleep my arms in minutes.</p>

<p>The next few weeks should be interesting to see if this streak of good fortune continues. The way it’s going, though, I’m hoping he’ll be sleeping through the night by the time he’s 4 months old.</p>

            <p>Palin says she’s going to “put ‘the government’s checkbook’ online”:http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/09/18/palins-transparency-proposal-already-exists-in-dc/ so everyone can see what the government spends money on. The problem is that it’s already there: “USASpending.gov”:http://usaspending.gov. And which Senator did it in 2006? Barack Obama.</p>

<p>It’ll be fun to watch how many more stupid things she says and does in the next six weeks. Forget vetting her, they should have just given her an IQ test.</p>

<p>We’ve seriously cut back on our Manhattan drinking since Gay’s been either pregnant or nursing for the last 24 months. But a Manhattan sounded good on a Friday evening. We did a little taste test between our favorite Maker’s Mark and “Bulleit”:http://www.bulleitbourbon.com/home.htm. I like Bulleit and have been having it straight on occasion (i.e., when I’m out of Maker’s Mark) but never in a Manhattan until now.</p>

<p>We still prefer Maker’s Mark, but Bulleit is the only other bourbon I’ve had that I could drink in a Manhattan. It has a more aggressive taste than Maker’s Mark and is fairly spicy similar to Woodford Reserve. But all around, being a bit sweeter, Maker’s Mark makes a more enjoyable Manhattan, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Maker’s Mark trivia that I recently learned: Maker’s Mark was created to be the best bourbon for a Manhattan.</p>

            <p>I finally got an “SLR”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera camera, a “Canon EOS 450D”:http://www.dpreview.com/news/0801/08012403canoneos450d.asp (or it’s “maverick-style” name Canon Digital Rebel XSi), in the hopes of taking better photos.</p>

<p>I posted the best ones in “their own Photoset”:http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/sets/72157607352909589/ on Flickr.</p>

<p>It’s not as convenient to carry as a tiny point-and-shoot, but the quality is much higher and I can get different lenses to take more interesting shots. Now I need to get an HD camcorder to take better-quality videos of the kids before they grow up.</p>

            <p>If Sarah Palin was my mom, my name would be <em>Log Justice Palin</em>. Havana’s name would be <em>Strike Chipper Palin</em>. Hudson’s would be <em>Vise Peeper Palin</em>. <a href="http://politsk.blogspot.com/2008/09/sarah_13.html">Find out what your name would be</a> if you were born to a dishonest corrupt Alaskan hillbilly politician.</p>
