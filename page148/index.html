              <p>After we went to renew my driver’s license and get a flu shot, Havana and Hudson had doctor’s appointments today; Havana had her 18-month checkup and Hudson had his 2-month checkup. They also each got a couple shots.</p>

<p>We walked down a fall-colored California Ave to <a href="http://www.igougo.com/entertainment-reviews-b18277-Seattle-Circa_Grill_and_Alehouse.html">Circa</a> for lunch, which usually has some nice beers on tap. I had <a href="http://www.bbaybrewery.com/">Boundary Bay</a>’s Harvest Ale, their Oktoberfest beer, which I liked a lot and was a nice Fall beer, and Gay had a “Grimbergen”:http://www.grimbergenbier.be/beers “Abbey Ale”, which I assume is really their Dubbel. It was good, but had a weird grape flavor to it.</p>

<p>I had a burger, Gay had a chicken sandwich and Havana had chicken tenders and fries:</p>

              <p>Rush Limbaugh “explains”:http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_102208/content/01125113.guest.html why some conservatives don’t like Sarah Palin:</p>

<p>bq. These are the people who are embarrassed by Sarah Palin ‘cause she’s not an intellectual and she didn’t go to Harvard or have a college degree from approved universities and she drops her g’s from words like morning and says mornin’.  She’s embarrassing.</p>

<p>Rush Limbaugh and his lemmings are trying to make the argument that having an education, speaking clearly and being intelligent are now bad things. I can imagine Republican households all over the country telling their children that school isn’t important, books are evil, understanding the world around you is pointless and communicating coherently is unnecessary. That’ll make America great!</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/business/economy/24panel.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin"><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/10/23/us/23greenspan-600.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>This is shocking, in a good way. Greenspan “testified to Congress”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/business/economy/24panel.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin that deregulation and a free-market don’t always work and it caused the recent bank failures:</p>

<p>bq. “I made a mistake in presuming that the self-interests of organizations, specifically banks and others, were such as that they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders and their equity in the firms,” Mr. Greenspan said.</p>

<p>The “invisible hand”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand sometimes pushes too hard, apparently.</p>

<p>bq. Referring to his free-market ideology, Mr. Greenspan added: “I have found a flaw. I don’t know how significant or permanent it is. But I have been very distressed by that fact.”</p>

<p>When Alan Greenspan says that deregulation is not always good, you know it’s true. America rarely repeats the same mistake twice, so I’m optimistic that this economic disaster can help us return to a sane model of the economy where we don’t believe a free-market solves all problems, that regulation can be a positive and that taxes can create positive incentives.</p>

<p>Republicans love to quote Adam Smith in defense of the free market, de-regulation and low taxes. But even Adam Smith believed in taxing the rich more heavily than everyone else:</p>

<p>bq. The necessaries of life occasion the great expense of the poor. They find it difficult to get food, and the greater part of their little revenue is spent in getting it. … It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion.</p>

              <p>Andrew Sullivan “wonders”:http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/10/how-anti-intell.html about Palin’s love of education:</p>

<p>bq. Here’s one way to look at the question: how has Palin brought up her own kids? Her eldest son is a high-school drop-out. Her eldest daughter has had, so far as one can tell from press reports, very uneven attendance in high school, and no plans for college. Her other daughters seem to spend a lot of time traveling the country with their mom at tax-payers’ expense. I’ve seen them at several rallies with the Palins this fall. Are they not in school? The least one can say is that none of her children seems to have been brought up thinking that college is something to aspire to. And her new son-in-law just dropped out of high school as well.</p>

<p>It’s not surprising she doesn’t care about education, she’s dumb as a post herself and doesn’t care because lots of Americans look up to her as the poster-child for how far stupid people can go in America. But if she doesn’t care about her own kids getting an education, how much would she care about my kids getting a good education?</p>
