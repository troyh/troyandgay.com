          <p>Gay was tired of being pregnant and the waiting list for an induction was so long that we decided to go into Seattle to take Gay’s mind off it. We all went to the RV show at Qwest Field and while there, the OB/GYN called and said that we were next on the list to be induced and that we <em>may</em> get a call tonight or early tomorrow. The RV show was boring so we left and went to Elysian Fields, just down the block for an early dinner and hoping that the hospital would call. We had even packed the car with everything we needed to take to the hospital, just in case.</p>

<p>We’d never been to Elysian Fields and it’s a cool space, and much larger than the original Elysian. There was a large party nearby, seemingly to celebrate a newborn baby (3 months?), that Havana was fascinated with:</p>

<p>Little did she know her baby brother was soon to arrive.</p>

<p>I had a schooner of the Imperial IPA which was very good. It’s been a while since I’ve had a good Imperial IPA at a brewpub, probably since “we went to Steelhead in Eugene”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/08/seattle-to-eugene-or/.</p>

<p>I had the Kobe beef burger with bleu cheese and finished it off with a schooner of their Dragonstooth Stout. They make a very good stout and I’ve loved it ever since moving to Seattle; it’s right up there with Old Rasputin (but not quite <em>that</em> good).</p>

<p>It would have been very convenient if the hospital had called since we were minutes away, but they didn’t. So we went home. At 8pm, an hour-and-half after we got home, the OB/GYN called and said we could come in. We called Kelly to come over to watch Havana. Bam, she was at the house 10 minutes later and we jumped on the 8:50pm ferry.</p>

<p>We checked into the hospital at 9:30pm and the OB/GYN broke Gay’s water at 10pm. It was all very smooth and quick from there…</p>

          <p>Hudson Ale Hakala was born August 25th at 12:05am. He weighs 8 lbs 8 ounces, is 19 inches long (tall) and is perfectly healthy.</p>

<p>Labor was amazingly short, just 2 hours! He’s sleeping while mom and dad are drinking champagne at 4am.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>There’s a movement, called the “Amethyst Initiative”:http://www.amethystinitiative.org/article/view/21556/1/3831/, to have a national discussion on lowering the drinking age to 18. They understand that a 21 year-old drinking age just doesn’t work and is “supported”:http://www.amethystinitiative.org/signatories/ by universities across the country. It’ll never pass in America because America has a culture of governmental parenting rather than information, education and responsible parenting. I wonder how many parents tell their kids not to drink “Because you’re not allowed to” rather than “Because it’s dangerous and must be done responsibly”.</p>

<p>I’m not just for lowering it to 18, I think it should be abolished altogether. Half the fun of under-age drinking is that you’re not allowed to do it. Take that away and there’s little incentive to drink as a kid. In Europe, most countries have no drinking age and when you go to pubs, there aren’t any kids in them, in my experience. Drinking just isn’t “cool” to kids in Europe as it is in America. I think that’s because of the existence of a drinking age in America, not in spite of it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2735846274/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3222/2735846274_76a3c1d89e.jpg" alt="Smells like daddy" /></a></p>

<p>We will allow our kids to drink beer and wine in our home and we’ll educate them on it and, hopefully, demonstrate that moderation is a requirement. I think when they are teenagers and their friends are trying to get alcohol (and they will succeed regardless of the number of laws in place), our kids won’t think it’s that exciting because they know what it’s like. And more importantly, they will know when enough is enough and won’t feel the need to get completely “blotto”:http://www.thefreedictionary.com/blotto. If they can survive the teenage years with an intelligent and mature understanding of alcohol, they’ll be far better at surviving the years after they turn 21 when the government says “Drink all you want!”. We better have taught them correctly by the time they’re 21, because by then, we will have little influence or control on their behavior.</p>
