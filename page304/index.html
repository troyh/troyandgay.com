            <p>The M key on my iBook broke weeks ago. I emailed <a href="http://www.smalldog.com/">SmallDog</a> asking for a replacement key and they sent me one free-of-charge. Got it yesterday and my M key is as good as new. I love companies with great customer service.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.mediapost.com/dtls_dsp_news.cfm?newsID=238867">MediaPost</a> did an article on political advertising on the web and explicitly calls out <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> as a target for Dean’s campaign dollars:</p>

<p><em>The Dean for America campaign displayed a shift in strategy during the fourth quarter of last year. Compared to the previous quarter, when $67,300 went mainly toward ads on MSNBC, just $2,200 was earmarked for ads on Yahoo! GeoCities, VegSource, SoapZone, Recipezaar, The Christian Science Monitor, and Kaboose Network Kids Domain in the fourth quarter. The campaign boosted the bucks a bit in January when $6,000 bought placements on SoapZone and Recipezaar.</em></p>

            <p><a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=fisking&amp;s=sullivan020904">Andrew Sullivan</a>, a Republican, a Bush-supporter and very conservative commentator, slams Bush’s <em>Meet The Press</em> appearance:</p>

<p>_The president doesn’t know what he’s talking about, or he’s lying, or he trusts people telling him lies.</p>

<p>I cannot help liking the president as a person. I still believe he did a great and important thing in liberating Iraq (although we have much, much more to do). But, if this is the level of coherence, grasp of reality, and honesty that is really at work in his understanding of domestic fiscal policy, then we are in even worse trouble than we thought. We have a captain on the fiscal Titanic who thinks he’s in the Caribbean._</p>
