          <p>I talked about <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/11/001834.php">dumb cooking/computer ideas</a> in November. Now, here’s <a href="http://tmio.com/">a net-enabled refrigerator/oven</a>. I guess this is geared towards people who only eat casseroles. And casserole-eaters who have so much free time in the morning to prepare their casserole for the evening but just can’t spare 40 minutes in the evening after work to turn the oven on and to wait for it to cook. Tech companies just don’t understand cooking, why do we get so many dumb ideas and why do VCs fund them?!</p>

          <p>After 35 hours, our power was finally restored at 10:15am this morning. Why is electricity so poorly-maintained? Because it’s a monopoly. Monopolies have no incentive to improve their service, in fact, they are incented to not improve it because improving it costs money that cannot be recouped. And of course, since it’s a monopoly, we have no choice but to continue paying any fees they want to charge us regardless of the quality of the service.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T had a federally-granted monopoly on telephone service in the US for many years but the government finally broke it up (thanks to lawyers on behalf of MCI). We need lawyers to sue to break up power companies and create competition in this critical industry. The service will be more reliable and costs will be lower.</p>

          <p>Nothing to do but read news while the power is out and my laptop battery still has power, and I find that <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/nm/nfl_gibbs_dc">Joe Gibbs is returning to coach the Redskins</a> – I care because I grew up (and I use the term “grew up” loosely) in the Washington DC area. Has there ever been another coach who coached after being inducted into the Hall of Fame?</p>

          <p>Last night at 11pm the power went out due to the snow &amp; freezing rain. We woke up at 6am and still had no power. <a href="http://www.pse.com/">Puget Sound Energy</a> expected to have power restored by 2pm. 2pm came and went with no power. It’s been 17 hours without power except for my laptop battery and PSE has no idea when power will be restored now. And the house is getting colder by the hour.</p>

<p>It’s incredible that our country is so dependent on such a fragile resource as electricity. You’d think 3 inches of snow wouldn’t be enough to knock power out for <a href="http://www.kirotv.com/weather/2746462/detail.html">80,000 people</a>, but it’s more than enough. And we can’t even use a telephone (except for cell phones) because telephones today require electricity. Two steps forward, one step backward.</p>
