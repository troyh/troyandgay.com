    <p>One of <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com">Recipezaar’s</a> customer service e-mail addresses recently received the following spam messages:</p>

<blockquote>_Dear user of Recipezaar.com,

<blockquote>_Dear  user of  Recipezaar.com,

Some of  our clients complained  about  the spam  (negative e-mail content)
outgoing from your e-mail account. Probably, you have been infected by

follow  the instructions.

Kind regards,
    The Recipezaar.com team                               http://www.recipezaar.com

<p>Now, of course, I know this didn’t happen, because, well Troy/I = Recipezaar, but imagine someone at Earthlink or AOL or some random ISP getting the same message…</p>
