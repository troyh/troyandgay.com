  <article class="post-content">
    <p>When SCO started a $1 billion lawsuit against IBM claiming that IBM infringed on SCO’s copyrights in an attempt to kill linux, there were rumors that Microsoft was helping SCO. But it seemed just too much like conspiracy theories. But now there is <a href="http://www.opensource.org/halloween/halloween10.html">proof from internal SCO email</a> that Microsoft did fund SCO’s efforts to squash linux to the tune of over $100 million! One may argue that it’s “just business”, but given that Microsoft funneled the money through a 3rd party, it’s clear that even Microsoft knew it was something to be ashamed of. It’s especially ironic given that Microsoft cried “let the marketplace decide” when they were involved in antitrust suits, but now they’re relying on lawyers to kill their competition.</p>
