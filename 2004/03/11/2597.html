    <p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3499534.stm">George Michael is giving his music away</a>. Somebody doing something just because they love to do it. Weird. What if this spreads? What if artists made art just because they wanted to express themselves? What if programmers made software just because they liked to build useful things? Corporations would be sad and everyone else would be happy. This must be stopped! Can we stop being so selfish and think about the corporations for once?!</p>
