    <p><a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=fisking&amp;s=sullivan020904">Andrew Sullivan</a>, a Republican, a Bush-supporter and very conservative commentator, slams Bush’s <em>Meet The Press</em> appearance:</p>

<p>_The president doesn’t know what he’s talking about, or he’s lying, or he trusts people telling him lies.</p>

<p>I cannot help liking the president as a person. I still believe he did a great and important thing in liberating Iraq (although we have much, much more to do). But, if this is the level of coherence, grasp of reality, and honesty that is really at work in his understanding of domestic fiscal policy, then we are in even worse trouble than we thought. We have a captain on the fiscal Titanic who thinks he’s in the Caribbean._</p>
