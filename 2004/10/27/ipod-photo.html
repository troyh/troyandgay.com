  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I love my iPod. I love my Mac. I love Apple. I love my digital camera. I love technology. And Steve Jobs is 100% right that video on the iPod is a dumb idea. But I’ve been trying to figure out why I would want the “iPod Photo”:http://apple.com/ipodphoto. I can’t download my photos from my camera straight to the iPod Photo, so it’s not a replacement for a laptop on vacation (even if I didn’t want my laptop on vacation). Never in my life have I ever (or even wanted to) go to a friend’s house to show them my photos on their TV – I believe the only person who wants to see the majority of my photos is me. I already have TiVo that does the slideshows on my own TV, even if I were inclined to move the dock from my desktop to my TV or go find the cable to plug into the TV. And I really don’t understand why someone would want to carry 25,000 photos around.</p>

<p>But I’m sure the iPod Photo will sell like crazy. What are people going to really do with it?</p>
