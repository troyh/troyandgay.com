I’ve never had a massage before and certainly not a facial and I was apprehensive about it, but it was fun.</p>

<p>We had our private dinner on the beach. It was very windy, but the wind kept the mosquitos and humidity away. The dinner was a four-course meal: prawns sembala, papaya soup, duck with rice and vegetables and dessert was a fruit plate with black rice pudding. Everything was very very good. And we had a good bottle of wine too.</p>

<p>We were very full and it was late when we came back to our room at 9pm. We fell asleep on the lounge chairs by the pool.</p>

<p>I realized we hadn’t posted photos of our hotel room, so here’s a few random ones of the area outside the room starting with the entrance to the villa/room. The “room” is surrounded by a 7-foot wall so we had plenty of privacy and living area.</p>
