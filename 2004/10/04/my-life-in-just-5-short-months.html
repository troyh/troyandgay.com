    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375414576/recipezaar-20"><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/clintonmylife.jpg" alt="Bill Clinton's My Life" />I finally finished Bill Clinton’s memoir</a>.  Where else but on vacation with a 13 hour plane ride can you reasonably complete a 900 page book that details every little trip and dinner the president hosts in 8 years.  Heck, it took 400 pages and months to just get into the White House.  I almost couldn’t read the sections involving Ken Starr.  I can’t believe the lies he got away with….  And to think they tried to impeach Bill Clinton for lying about a personal matter, but more of W’s lies about Iraq are uncovered everyday and people are dying for them with no outcry in the press.
I have to admit, I liked <a href="http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2237">Sidney Blumenthal’s</a> and <a href="http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2530">Madeliene Albright’s</a> versions better.  They spent a lot more time providing historical background and political analysis to those years than Clinton had room for.  Still, it makes me long for a smart president again.  Hopefully…</p>
