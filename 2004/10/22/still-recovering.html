    <p>We’re still recovering from the trip back, both health-wise and sleep-wise. We can’t get on a regular sleep cycle, which is why I’m wide awake at 1am. And we’ve both been going through sickness, due to the rapid change in climate and/or the recirculating air on 20+ hours of airplanes. But we’ve had a productive week of work this week in spite of this, which feels good.</p>

<p>In spite of the drastic climate change, I’m happy to be in the Northwest Fall weather. The leaves have completely turned and mostly fallen and it’s alternating cloudiness and sun. For the first time in 5  years I’m looking forward to my birthday this year. And, as always, I’m looking forward to the holidays.</p>
