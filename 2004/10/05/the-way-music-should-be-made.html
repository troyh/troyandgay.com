    <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/03/magazine/03NONESUCH.html?oref=login">Good article about Nonesuch Records (the label of Wilco, Magnetic Fields and other favorites) in the NYTimes Magazine</a>.</p>

<p>“Nonesuch is piracy-proof,’’ the singer Emmylou Harris – who became the label’s first ‘‘adult pop’’ signing four years ago – said when I asked her to list the things that set her label apart. ‘‘Their audience actually enjoys buying a record. When I got into music in my teens, the album was a thing in itself. It was a whole piece of work that had a reason to flow the way it did. You weren’t interested in just one or two songs. Nonesuch is still in the business of supporting album artists.’’</p>
