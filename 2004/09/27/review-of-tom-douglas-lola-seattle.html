  <div class="post-content">
    <p>We went to dinner last night at “Lola”:http://www.tomdouglas.com/lola/ with Eric &amp; Steve. It was disappointing, though. We went weeks ago for lunch and it was great and I’ve been dying for a good Greek restaurant since moving to Seattle in ‘97, so I had high hopes for dinner. The food was good, but not great and pretty expensive. For appetizers, we had pita with tzatziki and “minty feta dip”. Both were great. We had prawn kebabs and pork kebabs; the prawn kebabs were average with the sauce just spread on like peanut butter, but the pork kebabs were good, although others disagreed with me. We had goat and roast leg of lamb for main dishes. Bother were good, but I expect something surprising from Tom Douglas.</p>

<p>The service was mediocre, it took us 10 minutes after sitting down and three attendant visits to get a drink order. I had a manhattan but they made a “perfect manhattan” (half sweet, half dry vermouth), not what I ordered, because I don’t like the dry vermouth. Bartenders should all know how to make manhattans, IMO. We ordered the little yeast doughnuts for dessert, but they weren’t as good as the doughnuts Dahlia Lounge serves. And their dessert menu did not have baklava, a staple of Greek desserts that even Americans like, and it had appertifs, but didn’t list ouzo.</p>

<p>The decor is typical Seattle, but poor lighting (Gay &amp; I were bathed in light, our friends were in the dark) and it is a very loud room. It was a struggle to hear our waiter or our friends over the room noise. But we think Tom Douglas realizes this… when we were there for lunch weeks earlier we sat at the bar right next to Tom Douglas and apparent business associates and they were discussing solutions to the noise problem.</p>

<p>Cost: $200 for four people, including a ($35) bottle of wine, one round of drinks, 2 appetizers, 2 main dishes, coffee and one dessert. Seems pricey. If I’m going to spend that much for dinner, I’d just assume go to Dahlia Lounge.</p>
