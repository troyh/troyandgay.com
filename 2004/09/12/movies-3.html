    <p><img src="http://www.americanrecordings.com/slayer/disco_reign.gif" alt="" />We’ve been watching lots of movies again recently. Nothing worth mentioning, but we saw “River’s Edge”:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091860/ last night. I hadn’t seen that movie since I was a teenager (feels like yesterday), but that movie is even better than I remembered. It must be the movie before Keanu Reeves got a lobotomy to remove all emotion. The reason I watched when I was a teenager is because it featured music by “Slayer”:http://www.americanrecordings.com/slayer/, and heavily, this was when Slayer was a nobody band, but one of my favorites (yes, I was a teenage boy once). And it was a lot of fun hearing those songs I hadn’t listened to in a lonnnng time. Anyhooo…. Crispin Glover was really good and Dennis Hopper was great, makes me wanna see “Easy Rider”:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064276/, but the uncaring of the characters to their friend’s murder and the way they all react was done better than any movie since. “The <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em> of the 80s”, the trailer said.</p>

<p>Watching “Godfather III”:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099674/ now…..</p>
