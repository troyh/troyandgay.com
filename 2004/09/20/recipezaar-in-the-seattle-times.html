  <article class="post-content">
    <p><img src="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/ABPub/2004/09/17/2002038805.jpg" alt="" />The “Seattle Times”:http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002040554_btinterface20.html features “Recipezaar”:http://www.recipezaar.com in their Tech “Interface” section. Much better than the “Red Herring article”:http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2789 and the Seattle Times understands that you <em>link</em> to web site you are talking about in an online article. The photo was taken at our colocation facility in downtown Seattle – the machines behind us are the servers that run the site.</p>

<p>Tomorrow morning we’ll have to head to the newsstand and buy several copies. I don’t think I’ve been in a newspaper since I was a kid playing soccer and was mentioned in the paragraph blurb about the game.</p>
