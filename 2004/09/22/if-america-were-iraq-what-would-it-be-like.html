    <p><a href="http://www.juancole.com/2004_09_01_juancole_archive.html#109582366638394688">Juan Cole</a>: What would America look like if it were in Iraqâ€™s current situation? The population of the US is over 11 times that of Iraq, so a lot of statistics would have to be multiplied by that number.</p>

<p>Thus, violence killed 300 Iraqis last week, the equivalent proportionately of 3,300 Americans. What if 3,300 Americans had died in car bombings, grenade and rocket attacks, machine gun spray, and aerial bombardment in the last week? That is a number greater than the deaths on September 11, and if America were Iraq, it would be an ongoing, weekly or monthly toll.</p>
