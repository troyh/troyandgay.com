    <p>I see lots of people struggling with Windows (and IE) on a daily basis. It’s sad considering they have a solution. But what’s terrible is that they just take this punishment as if “computers are just this way” or “I’m just not computer savvy”. It’s crazy. What other industry survives with such unhappy customers? When will Microsoft start paying attention? When people stop using Windows! …</p>

<p>The WSJ’s “Walt Mossberg”:http://ptech.wsj.com/ptech.html: _The single most effective way to avoid viruses and spyware is to simply chuck Windows altogether and buy an Apple Macintosh. Apple’s operating system, Mac OS X, is harder for the criminals to infect…</p>

<p>There has never been a successful virus written for Mac OS X, and there is almost no spyware that targets the Mac. Plus, the Mac is invulnerable to viruses and spyware written for Windows. Not only is it more secure, but the Mac operating system is more capable, more modern and more attractive than Windows XP, and just as stable.</p>

<p>Macs are as good as, and often better than, Windows PCs at doing the most common computing tasks: Web browsing, e-mail, word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, photos, music and video. The Mac version of Microsoft Office can handle Windows Office files with ease, and it produces files that Office for Windows handles effortlessly. Apple’s computers are also gorgeous._</p>

<p>And “David Pogue”:http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/16/technology/circuits/16stat.html echos the same in the NYT in his review of the new “iMac”:http://apple.com/imac: <em>In the long run, they’ll benefit most from the iMac’s stealth feature: Mac OS X. Not only is this operating system rock-solid and, for a first-timer, much easier to understand than Windows, so far it’s also 100 percent free from viruses, Trojan horses, spyware and all the grief that comes with them. This month, Microsoft is rolling out to the much larger Windows XP audience an 80-megabyte bundle of security patches called Service Pack 2. Mac maniacs are fond of pointing out that most of the new Windows security features were built into Mac OS X from Day One.</em></p>
