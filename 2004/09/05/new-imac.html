  <article class="post-content">
    <p>In an “interview”:http://www.macworld.com/news/2004/09/03/joswiak/index.php with an Apple exec on the new iMac, he points out something that Apple and their customers understand but that few, if any, PC users realize about design: _ teeny little things like that that tend to, over the course of time, make people love their Mac and inspire magazines like yours, versus people getting [angry] over time at their PCs because of little things that drive them nuts_</p>

<p>One of my favorite things about my iBook is the latch to close it. It’s magnetic, so when I close it the magnet pulls the latch out so it can lock closed. On PC laptops, the latch is always sticking out, just waiting to get broken off. A 1¢ magnet makes my iBook better. Another great iBook design is the light on the plug: it’s orange when charging and green when charged. Not only is this more logical than PC laptops typical design (on when charging, off when charged; or one light on when charging, another one when charged), but its location is more logical than simply throwing an LED on the side of the laptop the way PCs do.</p>

<p>It really is the little things that make you love products.</p>
