    <p>Gay has done the majority (all) of the work in planning the wedding so far. But even though it’s been all her, that doesn’t mean it’s easy on me (poor poor Troy!). Making any wedding-type decision for a man is far more painful than for a woman. ;) But that aside, I highly recommend eloping if you’re thinking of planning a wedding. Weddings are a scam…. try it yourself, call a photographer to take some photos and they’ll charge $100/hr. Mention “wedding” and the price is suddenly $500/hr, if not more. Same for everything else. My advice: set your budget, halve, and halve it again. You’ll end up paying your original budget in the end.</p>

<p>But I do have my jobs… aside from my suit, I have to get the beer (!) and handle the music setup. We’re not doing a band, we’re doing music streamed from our laptops. Which also means I’ve been selecting the music. I don’t know what I’d do without the internet; I don’t want to buy Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, any 80’s one-hit wonder CDs, or any stuff my parents like (Kenny Rogers, Dolly Parton, etc.) because I just want a song or two. Thanks to P2P, I’ve got a nice set of wedding music.  And I don’t know how I’d do this without a computer; just 5 years ago and I’d have to hire a DJ to swap CDs all night. But now I can just set up playlists that mix nicely all by itself, and if our friends want to, they can do their own DJing at our wedding. Technology!</p>
