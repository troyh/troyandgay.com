  <article class="post-content">
    <p>This weekend was the annual <a href="http://www.vashonchamber.com/frame_visitor_StrawberryFest.htm">Strawberry Festival</a> weekend on Vashon. I’ve been getting a little tired of the whole thing… it’s a nice small-town thing, but the funnel cake stands are just too cheesy and the booths selling hippie jewelry and the bad food are just too much. And I guess I’m really getting old because the teenage kids hanging out and posturing is annoying to me – you’d think after generations, teenagers would advance a bit, but they’re the same as I was (except I’m still annoying).</p>

<p>We were going to go on Saturday afternoon, but rain just poured down. We eventually got there after 6pm and it was empty due to the rain. We had a couple beers at the happening “little yellow house”, where we <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/07/001572.php">poured beers last year</a>, and then went to the wine/jazz party that a friend organized. Lots (5) of Walla Walla wineries there and we had a nice conversation about Walla Walla (where Gay went to college) and about the wine business with a guy from <a href="http://www.reiningerwinery.com/">Reininger Winery</a>. Then we got in the middle of a fight between two guys and had to break it up. Fun.</p>

<p>We had dinner at one of the two mexican restaurants (and more beers). Then back to the yellow house to listen to the music, like the crowd-pleasing “Pink Cadillac” and “Light My Fire” (Jim Morrison must’ve been spinning in his grave). We met up with some friends, one of which had just got in a fight. Lots of fighting this year. He apparently asked a woman to dance and her husband didn’t like it. So they fought. Had some more beers and left.</p>

<p>It’s fun to live in a small town. In some ways, I feel like I’m back in high school where I knew everyone at every party. Vashon isn’t that small, but it’s different to live in a place where you either know or recognize most people you see in public. But I’m glad the Strawberry Festival is over.</p>
