    <p><a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/MT/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=1933">My friend Isabel chastised me for not mentioning 3/11, the Madrid bombings.</a>  She is right, of course. It has only been a few weeks and it seems the continued success of al Qaeda in Madrid has been lost already in this country as Condolezza Rice only finally appears before our 9/11 commission today.
Undoubtedly, the Madrid bombing affected the outcome of the Spanish election, but not in the way it was framed immediately afterwards. From what I have read, Aznar’s government wasn’t popular, not just for its Iraq stance, but his botched handling of the bombing (blaming the Basques) did not help – reminds me all to well of our own President’s continued insistence of whether Iraq had anything to do with 9/11…“See if Saddam did this. See if he’s linked in any way.”
I’ve read estimates that say the 3/11 operation was financed on $1,000.  It has become very cheap to kill people.  I feel it in my heart that Britain will be next.  This is a misunderstood war, and the Iraq war has handed our enemy precisely the propaganda they need.</p>
