    <p>“eBooks are selling”:http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,64563,00.html I love this, printed books are a dying. They’re just too obsolete these days by the time they hit the bookstores. And, IMO, cookbooks are even more susceptible to this. Who wants to buy a cookbook of 300 recipes where you only like 5 or 10 of the recipes? What if you could pay less for 300 recipes that you really like? And an electronic version that you could print and re-print as you dirty the paper in the kitchen. Cookbooks will go the way of printed encyclopedias.</p>
