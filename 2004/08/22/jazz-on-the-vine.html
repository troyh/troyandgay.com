    <p>Last night, we went to the “charity auction”:http://www.vashonisland.net/rotary/ that we “helped out initially”:http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2625 on. It was held at “Misty Isle Farms”:http://www.mistyislefarms.com/, the home of Tom Stewart, a local Vashon celebrity. That alone was a treat for us, never having been there. He lives on beautiful grounds, immaculately landscaped complete with a waterfall and a rose garden.</p>

<p>It was raining like crazy (Seattle has had an unusually wet summer) and it was outside, but it was covered by a huge tent. The food was prepared by the same people who did our wedding Rehearsal Dinner a few weeks ago, so that was good. The event was a wine festival so there was plenty of wine and cheese to taste, and that we did.</p>

<p>Most of the auction items were expensive bottles of wine and we were outbid on a few bottles of wine by people at our own table, apparently wine connoisseurs. But we did end up with a bottle of 1984 “Stags Leap”:http://www.stagsleapwinery.com/ Cabernet Sauvignon. I think we overpaid, but hey, it’s for charity. :)  Gay also bought three of the table centerpieces, large glass vases.</p>

<p>After the auction, we went to our friends’ house for some (more) wine, to play with their new puppy and we watched “Fargo”:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116282/. Great movie.</p>
