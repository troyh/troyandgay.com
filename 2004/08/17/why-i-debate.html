  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I loved debate in high school and college, and I’ve started to volunteer with the local high school team.  I really think it is one of the best things I ever did for my education and I want to continue to support the activity, especially since the number of women in the activity has declined over the past few years.</p>

<blockquote>_Shaw and others say that while debate skills can help students earn college scholarships, there are other payoffs as well. Debate requires and develops verbal, reasoning and communication skills, and promotes creativity and expansive thinking on a broad range of subjects, supporters say.  National research has shown that debate promotes academic performance, such as higher reading skills._</blockquote>
