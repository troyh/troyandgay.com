    <p>We went to dinner with friends last night at “Lark”:http://www.nwsource.com/ae/scr/edb_vd.cfm?ven=15321&amp;s=nws. It’s a tapas restaurant that doesn’t call itself a tapas restaurant. From my bad memory, we had duck breast proscuitto with huckleberries, scallops with ham hocks, leg of lamb, hanger steak, lobster mushrooms, and a few other dishes. All were very good. The servings are much larger than a typical tapas place, so we ended up with too much food. And, of course, all four of us got desserts which were even bigger, so we couldn’t finish them. I had the delicious almond cake, which was my favorite of all the desserts we ordered.</p>

<p>It used to be an Ethiopian place that I went to years ago once, but the decor is far better than the sparse Ethiopian restaurant’s decor. It’s small and they fit a lot of people in so its noisy and hard to talk. The booths might be quieter, but we weren’t in a booth.</p>

<p>Near the end of dinner, one person of a group of three at a booth next to us recognized Gay &amp; I from our days at Microsoft – we worked in Outlook together. Those Microsoft days were so long ago to me now, it’s so surprising to see and recognize people from that period of my life. But then again, Seattle’s a small world and Microsoft’s a huge company so it’s hard to throw a coffee cup without hitting a Microsoft employee in Seattle (not that I’ve tried).</p>
