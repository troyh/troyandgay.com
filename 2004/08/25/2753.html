  <article class="post-content">
    <p>We watched “Love Actually”:http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/love_actually/ last night. <em>Stupid Actually</em>. This movie was so bad in so many ways it’s pointless to even talk about it. And both Siskel Ebert and Roeper liked it. I may have to stop respecting their opinions. Almost every relationship featured a man and his female employee, except for the 6 year-old kid and his classmate (seriously). This wasn’t about love, it’s about sexual harassment in the workplace. I mean, this movie was just embarrassingly bad. Hugh Grant played the Prime Minister of England. ‘nuff said. Crikey!</p>
