    <p>Bush’s “acceptance speech”:http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/11/20041103-3.html: <em>Reaching these goals will require the broad support of Americans. So today I want to speak to every person who voted for my opponent: To make this nation stronger and better I will need your support, and I will work to earn it. I will do all I can do to deserve your trust. A new term is a new opportunity to reach out to the whole nation. We have one country, one Constitution and one future that binds us. And when we come together and work together, there is no limit to the greatness of America.</em></p>

<p>I hope he’s as successful in uniting the country as he was in dividing it.</p>
