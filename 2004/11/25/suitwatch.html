  <article class="post-content">
    <p><a href="http://lists.ssc.com/pipermail/suitwatch/2004-November/000080.html">SuitWatch</a>: “Why do commercial software makers whine about    the “threat” of “commoditization” while analysts and press, mostly paid for by vendors, whine along in harmony? Second, why has nobody ever whined about the “threat” of physical commodities, such as those that give us food and shelter, that we can’t live without?”</p>

<p>The rest of it is a good read. And I like his construction industry analogy to software. When asked about my old of Program Manager at Microsoft, I always said a PM was like the architect (they don’t actually do the work, they just think about it) and I haven’t heard a better description yet. :)</p>
