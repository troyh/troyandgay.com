    <h1 class="post-title">Milgard Windows Lifetime Guarantee lie</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>We bought a  house in 2001 that was built in 1993 with windows from a company called <a href="http://milgard.com/">Milgard Windows</a>. A few of the windows in the house have condensation between the two panes of glass. But Milgard Windows have a <a href="http://milgard.com/about-milgard/lifetime-guarantee.asp">Lifetime Guarantee</a> so this should be no problem to have fixed.</p>

<p>Wrong. It turns out, that Milgard’s “Lifetime guarantee” only lasts as long as the purchaser owns the house. So the day we bought the house, the lifetime guarantee ended. No one died, the windows are still in the house, so what’s the “life” part of “lifetime”?!</p>

<p>We found this out after we bought new Milgard windows for our office remodel. So having learned a lesson from the old window warranty, we want to make sure these new windows are covered as much as possible. Obviously, Milgard will find any reason to void the warranty so we figured we’d better have our documentation on the purchase with the warranty information we were given.</p>

<p>But we weren’t given a receipt for the windows, just a bill from the contractor for the windows. So we asked for a real receipt. Of course, they said that’s easy and had the distributor get us the receipt. We got a faxed receipt (no original copy) with the prices whited-out. Hmmm. We called the distributor and explained that we want a receipt and were told we can’t have one.</p>

<p>And then we get an angry email from our contractor telling us that our “rather bizarre” request is impossible. It’s impossible to get a receipt for a purchase?! The construction industry is looking pretty shady to us at this point.</p>
