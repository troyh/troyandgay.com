  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Last night at 11pm the power went out due to the snow &amp; freezing rain. We woke up at 6am and still had no power. <a href="http://www.pse.com/">Puget Sound Energy</a> expected to have power restored by 2pm. 2pm came and went with no power. It’s been 17 hours without power except for my laptop battery and PSE has no idea when power will be restored now. And the house is getting colder by the hour.</p>

<p>It’s incredible that our country is so dependent on such a fragile resource as electricity. You’d think 3 inches of snow wouldn’t be enough to knock power out for <a href="http://www.kirotv.com/weather/2746462/detail.html">80,000 people</a>, but it’s more than enough. And we can’t even use a telephone (except for cell phones) because telephones today require electricity. Two steps forward, one step backward.</p>
