  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I enjoy <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/179256_msftopen25.html">stories like this</a> about Microsoft, the long-time epitome of anti-open-source company, moving towards open source. Many old Microsoft friends who told me years ago that open source was a “fad”, “for idiots”, “communist”, “anti-American” (I’m not even lying!), etc. surprisingly forget the things they said. Ballmer himself even called it a “cancer” <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/">years ago</a> and that same CEO is moving towards the deadly disease. Open source software won’t lead to the demise of the United States, capitalism, or society. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3830545.stm">Iraq is realizing</a> what open source and linux will do for their country. The fact is that open source will revitalize not only the tech industry but all industries because the wheel won’t have to be reinvented every time a company is founded.</p>
