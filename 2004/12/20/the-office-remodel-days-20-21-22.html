    <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2349.jpg" alt="IMG_2349.jpg" />This weekend was a productive one for the office. We’ve all but finished painting. Gay did most of the painting while I did the electrical work. There’s still a bit of touch-up painting left to do, but the photo shows the progress.</p>

<p>On Friday, we went to <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/136935_frys28.html">Fry’s in Renton</a> and we got a <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/patch_panel.html">patch panel</a> and an <a href="http://www.stayonline.com/tone_probe_kits/1004.asp">electrical tone and probe kit</a>. On Saturday, I wired all 16 of the CAT5 outlets into the patch panel – easy but very tedious. Our local hardware store didn’t have the style of outlets we have in our house so we still need to get those and then I can finish the outlet wiring. That should just be an hour or so of work to complete. I haven’t been electrocuted yet, but I did blow the fuse once wiring a wall switch.</p>

<p>When it’s all said and done, I estimate we will have saved close to $700 on the electrician bill; it would have taken one electrician one full day to finish the work (~$500 in labor) and at least a couple hundred dollars in materials because they charge outrageous prices for 50¢ items like outlets and even more for CAT5 receptacles. If you go to Home Depot and buy <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/prel80/HDUS/EN_US/diy_main/pg_diy.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@0033154841.1103574459@@@@&amp;BV_EngineID=ccdgadddgigijmdcgelceffdfgidgjk.0&amp;CNTTYPE=PROD_META&amp;CNTKEY=misc/searchResults.jsp&amp;MID=9876&amp;N=2984+3004&amp;pos=n04">one CAT5 jack it’s $6</a>. I bet the electrician would have charged $15 or more for each of the 16 jacks – imagine paying $240 just for jacks! Home Depot sells them in packs of 10 for $30, so we paid $60 and we have have some left over to use elsewhere. Our cost in tools and materials: $200. And we have the tools to use in the future.</p>

<p>Savings on doing the painting ourselves? Given that we have three colors, Ron’s painting estimate of $1800 would easily have hit $3000, not unlike his other estimates. ;) Our cost in paint and supplies: $150. Ron’s $1800 estimate to paint a 400-square-foot room was insane to start, however.</p>

<p>Assuming we would have paid $3,700 for both painting and electrical work, we saved ~$3,400 by doing it ourselves. Ron’s 16% “overhead &amp; profit” tax on the work would have been an additional $600. Total savings: $4,000!</p>

<p>Next week, the carpet should get installed and we’ll be done!</p>
