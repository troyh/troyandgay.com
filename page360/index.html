              <p>My dad had a CAT scan and an MRI a couple weeks ago and today confirmed that he has <a href="http://www.hydroassoc.org/">hydrocephalus</a>. He is scheduled to have an operation on September 11 to install a <a href="http://www.hydroassoc.org/newsletter/shunt.html">shunt</a> in his skull to relieve the pressure on his brain.</p>

              <p>In contrast to nice people like Bergy, we recently had a member on the site threaten people with violence! This person even posted postal addresses for some people and implied that “someone” was going to pay them a visit. There are some real whackos in the world!</p>

<p>So now we’re in the process of contacting law-enforcement officials in this person’s area. Fortunately, their ISP is taking this very seriously and is working with us to determine who the person is. So that’s how my day’s going.</p>

<p>I wonder if all recipe web sites have to deal with this type of stuff.</p>

              <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/bergypkg.JPG" alt="bergypkg.JPG" /> The other day, a package arrived in the mail for our dogs, Illy &amp; Ouzo, from a famous <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> member, <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=4470">Bergy</a>. Actually, the package was from her <strike>doggies</strike> cats.</p>

<p>Inside was a cute card written by Bergy’s <strike>dogs</strike> cats (actually, I suspect Bergy wrote it) and gourmet dog cookies and Illy &amp; Ouzo both loved them! Normally when given treats they eat them right there and then look at you waiting for another. Only the good treats make them grab them and run away. And that’s what they did with these. Illy ran outside and Ouzo ran the other direction to living room so they could eat them in peace.</p>

<p>Thanks Bergy! And the dogs thank you too! :-)</p>

<p>We’ve received several gifts from members of Recipezaar and we’re terrible at returning the favor. We need to be better site owners.</p>

              <p>Gay just left for Spokane for her godfather’s funeral tomorrow. It’s just me and the dogs fending for ourselves tonight. I think Gay and I have spent a total of 6 nights apart in 5 years. This will make #7.</p>
