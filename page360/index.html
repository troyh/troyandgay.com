          <p><a href="http://letour.fr/"><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/letour2003.gif" alt="letour2003.gif" /></a> Tyler Hamilton, the other American, won today’s stage after surviving a <em>long</em> breakaway. He moved up a little in the overall standings, but probably not close enough to get on the podium at the end. But it was his first Tour stage win.</p>

          <p>Google’s new ad program is the worst thing to hit the internet since, well, since the internet. Google had a “brilliant” idea to put their text ads on sites that are targetted to the content. But they do this not by referencing their cache of pages on their own servers, but they do it by immediately doing a request to the site to find out what is on the page. So, in effect, Google doubles the load on a site immediately! There’s smart people at Google, why couldn’t they figure out that their idea was a very very bad one?</p>

<p>We have no choice but to remove Google’s ads from our site.</p>

          <p>…more than I thought.  Without trying to get too excited about an announcement to come which will undoubtedly not live up to our excitement, Troy and I went from idea to application in 2 weeks with only about 5 real days of programming.  I am surprised at how much we have learned and how much fun it is to create again (instead of just fixing and tweaking).  There are only a few version 1.0s to happen in new markets.  It is exhilarating.</p>

          <p>Ok, I might be a bit of an iPod-head, but these BuyMusic.com ads are not parody, they are simply trying to confuse the market.  They look like Apple Music ads, they use the same concept, look and font.  Knowing Apple, <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-230273.html?legacy=cnet">they will undoubtedly sue</a>.  IMHO, there is a worthwhile copyright right suit here, though Apple would benefit from the ads if only their Windows version Music store were available.</p>

          <p>I accidentally saw the above headline yesterday so I was dreading every moment of yesterday’s stage as we watched it last night.  I didn’t see how the headline ended so I  know if he was losing or out of the tour or whatever.  I was on pins and needles during the descents and stomach-turning as Lance took off his helmet for the final climb.  It really was an amazing stage.  Go Lance!  …and there is a short story some where to be written about the little boy with the musette who pulled the yellow jersey off his bike.</p>
