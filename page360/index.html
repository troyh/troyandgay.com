              <p>Gay just left for Spokane for her godfather’s funeral tomorrow. It’s just me and the dogs fending for ourselves tonight. I think Gay and I have spent a total of 6 nights apart in 5 years. This will make #7.</p>

Gay thinks they’re stupid, but they keep the drink chilled with the ice water in the bottom part of the glass. They’re a little hard to drink out of and a little hard to handle, but I think they look cool.</p>

              <p>Working on MyWireService, I’ve been surprised at the number of library &amp; school news sources are out there in RSS – I really expected only tech sources and weblogs.  <a href="http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/2003/08/15.html#a44322">The Shifted Librarian encourages other libraries to put their information in RSS</a>, and I got to thinking: use a weblog and RSS is easier to support than an e-mail newsletter.  No membership database, no customers with forgotten passwords, not separate tool where some stuff is in the email newsletter but not available on the site, etc.  Unfortunately, RSS Aggregators are not as ubiquitous as email…yet.  We hope that <a href="http://mywireservice.com">our Web-based RSS Aggregator</a> will become more common just like web-based email is more convenient…</p>

              <p>For anyone who runs a website this story is normal, but for the benefit of those that don’t…</p>

<p>One of our members has <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=42884">a problem with certain pages on our site which causes his browser to crash</a>.  He also has the same problem with FoodTV, so the problem is not just us, it is some code on our page which triggers a bug in IE.  We have another member with the same problem, so it is not just his particular set up either.  Obviously we want our site to work for these folks, but there is nothing further we can do.  We’ve tried to send mail or report these bugs to Microsoft before, but they simply do not have time to work on a bug that only hurts such a small number of folks, and I understand that.  If we could get their source code we could actually debug this problem ourselves and tell Microsoft exactly where the problem lies and provide them with a fix.  We have an incentive to work on this, they don’t, but we can’t fix it.</p>

<p>This is why…
<!-- more -->
…“open source” software is good.  Because anyone who has an incentive to figure out the problem can, and then they can submit the fix and hopefully make the world a better place for everyone.  Software doesn’t have to be free to be open…open is good.  You can open the hood of your car to try and fix it right? it really is no different.</p>

<p>For now, we’re just stuck.  And there is nothing further we can do to help those folks.</p>

<p><img src="http://textamerica.com/mlogs/IMG_4875/Thumb/IMG0814144403953.jpg" alt="" />Everyone knows how fast stuff spreads on the web and all that but <a href="http://blackout.textamerica.com">this site</a> allows anyone to post pictures of the blackout via email (they dumbly call them “moblogs”).  I don’t get how textamerica lets people do this for free…but whatever, it is cool.</p>
