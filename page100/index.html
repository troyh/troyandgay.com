          <p>I got the latest Comcast bill notification email and looked at my bill and discovered a charge for $13.40 under Comcast Cable Television:</p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/picture-312.png"><img src="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/picture-312.png?w=300" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The funny thing is that we don’t have Comcast Cable TV. We used to years ago, so I assume that “Inactive DCT Lease” means that we’re being charged for the inactive Digital Cable TV set-top box leases that we used to have (we only had 2, not 4, though). I contacted their customer service and they credited us for the charge and for the charges back to June when they started charging us for this. In June and July they only charged us for one lease. Either someone screwed up in the billing department and this happened to lots of people (likely since the customer service rep seemed not surprised by this and quickly fixed it) or Comcast is evil. I am assuming the former… for now.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Eric and Valerie are going to sail to France so they had their going-away party tonight at the very cool <a href="http://www.bastilleseattle.com/">Bastille</a> at 7:30. That’s a little late for us early-birds to have dinner so Gay and I went to Maritime Brewery’s <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/jolly-roger-taproom-seattle">Jolly Roger brewpub</a> down the street for a beer and a light dinner (tiny burgers and oyster sandwiches) before the party.</p>

<p>At Bastille, we caught up with several people we haven’t seen in a long time and met some of Eric and Valerie’s friends. Eric and Valerie are renting out their house in Seattle and living on their boat for a couple weeks until they’re ready to sail. From Seattle, they’ll go to San Francisco and stay there for a few weeks. Then down to Mexico, through the Panama Canal, to Cuba (!), Bermuda and then across the ocean to the northern coast of France. The trip should take them a year. Seems dangerous to me but they’ve sailed across the Atlantic before and survived. They’re planning to find and buy a house in the Dordogne region of France and split their time between there and Seattle. Living the dream.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>A slowly-growing trend in craft beer is to package it in cans. 21st Amendment, which <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/17/21st-amendment-brewpub-review/">we visited</a> in 2008, is one of the few that does this now and we can finally get their beers locally so Gay picked some up recently. I look forward to getting more craft beer in a can – easier to carry, less prone to breakage, better protection from light and air and more eco-friendly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3814636507/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3546/3814636507_e1d92abdde.jpg" alt="Cool beer packaging (great beer)" /></a></p>

<p>This <em>Brew Free! or Die IPA</em> is delicious. We also got their <em>H__ell or High Watermelon Wheat</em>, which I’d heard good things about in spite of it being a wheat beer, but I didn’t like it at all.</p>

          <p>I’ve missed the rain; and the green grass. I hope it rains for the next few days.</p>

<p>We missed the first release of “Dry Fly”:http://www.dryflydistilling.com/main.php whiskey this weekend – all sold out state-wide. This is the first whiskey made in Washington since Prohibition from the first distillery in Washington since Prohibition. They will be releasing another batch around the holidays, we’ll have to be more on top of it then. We “visited”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/02/dry-fly-distillery/ Dry Fly last year.</p>

          <p>We packed the kids in the car right after their midday naps and went to Newcastle, WA to Julie and Hans’ house for <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/07/20/gays-mom/">Gracelyn</a>’s 1st birthday party. On the way home I resisted the <a href="http://www.frys.com/isp/renton.html">Fry’s</a> in Renton and we went to get takeout at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/buddha-ruksa-seattle">Buddha Ruksa</a> in West Seattle. I’m not sure why we did because we weren’t very hungry after eating at the party, but we ate a little of it when we got home and left most of it for dinner tomorrow night.</p>
