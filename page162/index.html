              <p>For lunch, we went to a brewpub right around the corner from the hotel, <a href="http://www.steamplantgrill.com/">The Steam Plant Grill</a>. This was one of the coolest interiors of a restaurant I’ve been in:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2735010651/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3169/2735010651_e0c7839776.jpg" alt="Steam Plant Grill" /></a></p>

<p>It was the steam plant that delivered steam and electricity to downtown Spokane until 1986. They have electricity now, so I’m not sure how long they were without electricity in Spokane.</p>

<p>I got the sampling of all 9 of their beers and about 4 were good, which is a pretty good ratio. I really liked their stout.</p>

<p>Gay went to a girls lunch with a bunch of girls going to the wedding and I took Havana back to the hotel for her afternoon nap. That night, the Murphys, long-time friends of Megan’s family, had a party for all the out-of-town guests at their home. Gay’s mom, dad and aunts watched Havana and Gay and I had another date. We met Jon’s family and friends, had lots of food and wine and Jon was thrown into the pool.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Yes, Jon was thrown into the pool by his dad. Jon then threw his brother into the pool.</p>

              <p>We’ve been married for 4 years today. Gay’s mom, dad and aunts met us at the hotel as we checked-in and they babysat Havana while we went out to dinner. We went to “Wild Sage”:http://www.wildsagebistro.com/, “Downtown Spokane’s Premier Restaurant”. The food was okay. Gay’s pasta was overcooked, my goat cheese stuffed chicken was a bit too rich, but the appetizers were pretty good.</p>

<p>Today is also our 4th wedding anniversary, so we’ll celebrate in one of Spokane’s finest restaurants (no, not Applebee’s).</p>

              <p>Sirius and XM finally got <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/the-tech-observer/2008/07/29/no-more-static-sirius-and-xm-complete-merger">FCC approval</a> to merge. Supposedly by Fall, I’ll be able to listen to whatever station I want in both cars. Imagine that. It took the federal government 16 months to decide that’s a benefit to consumers.</p>
