<p>We left Vancouver Sunday and drove a couple hours north to Whistler. It’s a beautiful drive through the mountains and along the water. The highway was littered with spans of construction making the highway wider for the 2010 winter Olympics.</p>

<p>The house we’re in is in the mountains surrounded by tall evergreen trees. It’s much nicer to wake up to a view of mountains and trees and the sound of light rain than the street noise in Vancouver. Havana slept a lot better too.</p>

<p>We drove up the road a mile or so to Whistler Village for lunch at the Whistler Brewhouse, another MJG restaurant and only slightly better than the Yaletown Brewery in Vancouver. Havana and the waitress sure got along well, though. We wanted to take the gondola up the mountain but it was so cloudy and rainy that the view would have been limited. We ended up just walking through the village.</p>

<p>On Friday, we drove up to Vancouver to celebrate Lee’s 40th Birthday. Mark and Lee live in London and have come back to Seattle for a couple weeks. We got a late start, we left Seattle at 2pm and got to the border by 4pm, but with Friday traffic into Vancouver, it took another hour to get to “our hotel”:http://www.opushotel.com/. We haven’t been to Vancouver since “Gay’s (late) birthday in 2005”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2005/04/17/vancouver-2/.</p>

<p>The weather was perfect. We walked around Yaletown and went to dinner at “Yaletown Brewery”:http://www.markjamesgroup.com/yaletown.html. Last time I remember really liking Yaletown Brewery, so much that we went twice while we were there. But this time it was disappointing. They only had five beers on tap: a hefeweizen, a light lager, a red ale, a pilsner and an IPA. I had the IPA, which had decent hop flavor but had a sour aftertaste that I didn’t like. My second beer was their flagship red ale, which was better, but still a red ale which I generally don’t like. The food was okay, my black and bleu burger was better than Gay’s Greek burger.</p>

<p>Havana had a rough night, waking up every 2-3 hours – she doesn’t like being in new places and the street noise in the hotel was too loud, certainly not as quiet as home. When she doesn’t sleep well, neither do we. We were tired most of Saturday. There’s a Starbucks right across the street from the hotel so we had breakfast there and then back to the hotel for Havana’s morning nap. After that we had a nice stroll along the marina at False Creek. We ate sandwiches we got from a local grocery store and Havana played on the swings and slides at a park.</p>

<p>A high school friend of Gay’s lives in Vancouver and we got her babysitter to watch Havana while we went out to Lee’s party Saturday night. We got dressed quickly and drove to “Lift Bar and Grill”:http://www.liftbarandgrill.com/. It was so warm in the sun and on the water that the cold champagne they were serving before dinner tasted too good to me, so I had too much. And the wine was flowing during dinner, which didn’t help my effort to not have a hangover the next day. Dinner was great (I had a beef tenderloin) and we met a lot of Mark &amp; Lee’s friends that we’d never met before, including a couple that flew in from London. We had to leave the party early to relieve the babysitter at 10pm.</p>

<p>This is sad. “Robert Mondavi died today”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/17/business/17mondavi.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;oref=slogin at 94. I just read and enjoyed his autobiography “Harvests of Joy” and another great book that tells the story of Napa Valley, “Napa: An American Eden”, in which Mondavi played a significant role. He was a great thing for the American wine industry, both technologically and in marketing. His story is an inspiring one: He was run out of his family’s wine business after a feud with his brother and, at the age of 52 when most people would have started to think about retiring, started his own winery and worked hard for many years to make great American wines that could compete at the level of French wines.</p>

<p>Gay and I visited Napa Valley in 1998 and rode our tandem through it, stopping at the Mondavi winery and snuck into the “Opus One”:http://www.opusonewinery.com/ winery for a memorable lunch on top of the beautiful winery. Hardly a month would go by when a bottle of Robert Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon wasn’t in our wine rack waiting to be drank. Cheers!</p>

          <p>“Gasoline is cheap”:http://www.slate.com/id/2191491/:</p>

<p>bq. When measured on an inflation-adjusted basis, the current price of gasoline is only slightly higher than it was in 1922. According to the Energy Information Administration, in 1922, gasoline cost the current-day equivalent of $3.11. Today, according to the EIA, gasoline is selling for about $3.77 per gallon, only about 20 percent more than 86 years ago.</p>

<p>bq. Gasoline is also a fairly minor expense when you consider the overall cost of car ownership. In 1975, gasoline made up 33.4 percent of the total cost of owning and operating a car. By 2006, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, gasoline costs had declined to just 17.1 percent of the total cost of car ownership. … the fixed costs of ownership-insurance, licensing, taxes, and financing-have increased nearly fivefold since 1975. Maintenance costs have also quintupled over the same time period.</p>

<p>bq. On the environmental front, people concerned about greenhouse-gas emissions should be cheering today’s oil prices. Expensive motor fuel is the only thing that will lead consumers to use less oil and make the switch to hybrid vehicles, smaller cars, and public transit. Higher oil prices are convincing automakers to change their fleets.</p>

          <p>The Washington Post talks about “misogyny in the Democratic race”:http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/14/AR2008051403090.html. It’s sad that in 2008 women are still kept down and that it’s acceptable. I imagine one day I’ll have to explain to my daughter that it’s good to be smart and ambitious. That’s a talk I won’t need to have with my son.</p>
