        <article>
          <p>After brewing, I sat outside and drank Dogfish Head’s “Black &amp; Blue”:http://www.dogfish.com/brewings/Occasional_Rarities/Black_._Blue/58/index.htm. Gay found this at Esquin, a Seattle wine shop, and it cost $12.99 for a 750ml bottle. That’s about $6.50 for a 12 ounce beer, making it the most expensive beer I’ve ever had, I think.</p>

<p>It’s a Belgian-style beer, although it doesn’t mention the style on the bottle, and is brewed with blackberries and blueberries. I normally don’t like Belgian beers because they put strange ingredients in them. Strange ingredients is Dogfish Head’s thing, and I have yet to have a bad beer from them. This one has a slight reddish tint to it and is only slightly sweet, despite the fruit. I really liked it, although not as much as their “Raison D’Extra”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/24/dogfish-head-raison-dextra/. I tried to share some of it with Gay, but she didn’t like it at all. More for me!</p>

        <article>
          <p>Friday’s (first) beer was “Anderson Valley’s Hop Ottin’ IPA”:http://www.avbc.com/beers/ipa.html, a doubly hoppy and cloudy beer that went well with the sunny evening. I was surprised at how cloudy it was, I was expecting to find yeast still in it but there wasn’t any.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2538329243/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3143/2538329243_d71426f5ce.jpg" alt="Anderson Valley Hop Ottin' IPA" /></a></p>

<p>After that, I had an “Alaskan ESB”:http://www.alaskanbeer.com/esb.html, which we have plenty of in the fridge after “Havana’s 1st birthday party”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/03/havanas-1st-birthday-party/. This was the first one I had and, maybe Alaskan beers are ho-hum to me, it was surprisingly tasty and much more clear than the IPA.</p>

          <p>Mark and Lee are still in Seattle after celebrating “Lee’s birthday in Vancouver”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/18/vancouver-3/ so we had them and Eric over for dinner tonight. We had crab cakes, salmon dip, a leg of lamb, a mango salad, cheesecake for dessert and wine, of course. All the food was made by Gay (I barbecued the lamb, though) and all was very good.</p>

          <p>I saw this site several days ago and keep remembering it. “Christopher Huet”:http://www.christophehuet.com/ does some amazing art. Some of it I like, some it scares me. I really like this one, though:</p>

<p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/blog/pix/2008/05/bigheads.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>He even did the music on the site, which is also very good.</p>
