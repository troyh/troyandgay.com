          <p>Anyone watch <a href="http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/aaron.brown/index.html">Aaron Brown</a>? He’s the most wishy-washy news anchor I’ve ever seen. Instead of making statements, he hedges his bets by saying things like “It’s good news, or it’s not”, “It’s expensive, but maybe it’s inexpensive”, “It’s a nice day, or not”, “Sugar is sweet, or it could be sour”, “Earth is round, or maybe it’s flat”, etc. Hey Aaron: You’re annoying, or maybe you’re irritating.</p>

          <p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/nm/20040313/pl_nm/campaign_kerry_dc">Kerry requests monthly debates</a> so we can gauge for ourselves who is the best person for the job. But Bush refuses with a pathetic and downright insulting excuse! I’d rather see monthly live debates than 8 months of polished commercials daily. Bush, once again, lets America down. This guy thinks we work for him. We should <em>demand</em> that he debate so that the American people have more info to make their Nov 2 decision.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.newsforge.com/trends/04/03/11/0819219.shtml">BusinessWeek will be running a story</a> that refutes Microsoft’s claims that it had “no direct or indirect” dealings with SCO. SCO and Microsoft have both denied it. But Baystar, the middle-man venture firm who gave SCO $50 million, says that Microsoft executives did approach Baystar asking them to give SCO the money.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> BusinessWeek posted their <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2004/tc20040311_8915_tc119.htm">article</a>: <em>Lawrence Goldfarb, managing partner of BayStar, says that senior executives at the software giant had telephoned him about two months before the investment. Would he be interested in investing in SCO, they asked?</em></p>

<p>Why would Microsoft, a competitor to SCO, encourage an investment in a company with $20,000 in revenue last year and one clearly headed towards bankruptcy? Wouldn’t Microsoft prefer SCO go out of business? Or are they trying to keep the ridiculous anti-Linux lawsuits SCO has brought alive? I think the answer is obvious.</p>

          <p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3499534.stm">George Michael is giving his music away</a>. Somebody doing something just because they love to do it. Weird. What if this spreads? What if artists made art just because they wanted to express themselves? What if programmers made software just because they liked to build useful things? Corporations would be sad and everyone else would be happy. This must be stopped! Can we stop being so selfish and think about the corporations for once?!</p>
