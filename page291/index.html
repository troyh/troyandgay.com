            <p>Bin Laden <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/ap/20040415/ap_on_re_mi_ea/egypt_bin_laden_tape">offers a truce</a> to Europe. Why aren’t we in Afghanistan hunting this guy down? Instead, we’re spending billions of dollars, hundreds of American lives, thousands of Iraqi lives and years in Iraq installing a democracy that is sure to be overthrown within a week after we leave. Al Qaeda is the real threat to democracy in the middle east, not some egotistical dork in Fallujah.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>I’m slow, but I learned something new today: intel’s <a href="http://www.intel.com/products/ht/hyperthreading_more.htm">hyperthreading</a> appears to the computer as 2 CPUs. Imagine my surprise when I did a ‘cat /proc/cpuinfo’ on a new server and found it had 2 processors! The machine is co-located several miles away (so I couldn’t open it and look for a 2nd processor) and I was very confused when I looked at the picture in the motherboard manual clearly showing only one CPU socket. A little research on the net and I’m smarter about hyperthreading.</p>

<p>I’m normally annoyed by faked things like this and I’m very skeptical of intel’s claims of improved performance in their CPUs, but this time they may be on to something. The new server is a 2.8GHz P4 and is easily twice as fast (running Apache, that is) as another 2.4GHz P4 that lacks hyperthreading, although it should only be ~30% faster due to its faster CPU, faster RAM and faster FSB. I’m impressed.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Yeah, I don’t remember Easter being such a big holiday either. When I was a kid, we went to church, of course, and had a brunch and egg hunt (that Thom McAnn golden egg my parents hid had $5 in it every year!), but other than that, it was a normal Sunday, I thought. And in college, I was always surprised that my Greek friends always made such a big deal about Easter – Easter is bigger than Christmas in the Greek Orthodox church. Has Easter become more celebrated recently? I’m all for the eating holidays, and I understand the religious significance of the event, but….</p>
