    <p>After an almost completely disastrous day in the time trial on Saturday, all the Americans except for Floyd Landis put themselves out of contention. And Bobby Julich put himself in the hospital after crashing in a roundabout and breaking his wrist. Floyd Landis finished a minute, and second place, behind the winner and Hincapie stayed within a minute or so of him. But Leipheimer lost over 5 minutes!</p>

<p>In the second day of the mountains yesterday, Floyd Landis finished third and took the yellow jersey by 8 seconds after dropping all the strongest rivals, including Kloden. Surprisingly, Leipheimer stayed with him and is now the second highest-placed American, but still 5 minutes back. It looks like Landis, Menchov and Cadel Evans are the most likely podium places, but it’s still a long way to Paris.</p>

<p>The most enjoyable part of the day yesterday was watching Iban Mayo, probably the least amicable person in cycling today, crack and fall way off the back on the <em>first</em> climb of the day. Adding to the fun, he got angry at the cameraman following him on the motorcycle videotaping his pathetic performance. The cameraman was following the team leader who is supposed to be a contender for the race win and he’s the caboose on the train. That’s big news Iban; if you don’t want a cameraman following you, don’t ride in the Tour de France. He later abandoned the race altogether. This guy used to be a top rider, what happened to him?!</p>
