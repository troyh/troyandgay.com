  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Washington State is trying to get organized about marketing its beers.</p>

<blockquote>The crusade to establish Washington-made as a premium microbrew brand is in line for some help from the state Legislature, which appears willing to create a new industry promotional arm called the Washington Beer Commission.
&gt; 
&gt; If lawmakers give the OK, the commission will be officially empowered to levy a modest tax on its producers, put on fund-raising festivals and -- perhaps most important -- give away beer.
&gt; 
&gt; </blockquote>

<p>Washington does have great breweries, <a href="http://maritimebrewery.citysearch.com/">Maritime</a> and <a href="http://www.pikebrewing.com/">Pike Brewing Co</a> and even <a href="http://www.redhook.com/">Red Hook</a>, are great Seattle brewers and brewpubs like <a href="http://www.elysianbrewing.com/">Elysian</a> and <a href="http://www.bigtimebrewery.com/">Big Time</a> makes great beer too. But I have to admit, most of the beers I drink are from Oregon and California because they’re better. It’s heresy in Seattle to say this, but Seattle’s biggies, <a href="http://www.pyramidbrew.com/">Pyramid</a> and <a href="http://www.halesales.com/">Hale’s</a>, are not very good breweries, in my opinion – if your top beer is a Hefeweizen, it’s time to find a new brewmaster.</p>

<p>Maybe getting Washington beers noticed will help Washington State brewers to start making better beers when they realize they aren’t as good as <a href="http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/splash/default.aspx">Deschutes</a>, <a href="http://www.northcoastbrewing.com/">North Coast</a>, <a href="http://www.sierranevada.com/">Sierra Nevada</a>, etc.</p>
