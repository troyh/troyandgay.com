THE LAST DAY TO FILE CLAIMS IS MARCH 10, 2006</a></strong></p>

<p>I did attend Catholic school in Spokane.  I’m impressed they tracked me down.  The Catholic Diocese of Spokane is using Bankruptcy protection (don’t be fooled the Church is a corporation) to put a quick limit on the people who might come forward with sexual abuse charges, and conveniently, a corporation in bankruptcy protection does not have to suffer the embarrassment of damning testimony at trial.  <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002811879_webspokanesettlement17.html?syndication=rss">However, the strategy is backfiring.  The bankruptcy court has determined that all of the parishes are considered property of the Diocese</a>, that means they can be forced to sell the churches and everything in them to pay off the claims.</p>

<p>Godspeed to the claimants.</p>
