You think I’m scared of girls
Well maybe
But I’m not afraid of you
You want to scare me then you’ll cling to me no matter what I do</p>

<p><em>What Jail Is Like</em>
–Afghan Whigs</p>

<p>Listening to <a href="http://kexp.org">KEXP</a>, that oldie came on from one of my favorite bands, The Afghan Whigs. It brings back memories to when I used to blast <em>Gentlemen</em> and <em>Black Love</em> back in the early and mid-90s (when I was young and loved loud music). So I check out Greg Dulli’s new band, <a href="http://www.thetwilightsingers.com/">The Twilight Singers</a>, and find they have a new album. There’s something wrong with the industry when I don’t even know about music that I’ll definitely buy.</p>

I ordered <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Tiger</a>, the 5-license Family Pack of course, through Amazon weeks ago, but won’t get it til next week. But the reviews from <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/ptech/04/28/mac.tiger.ap/index.html?section=cnn_tech">CNN.com </a> and a very detailed one from <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10.4.ars/1">ArsTechnica</a> are very positive. I’ve never been one to get excited about OS releases, at least not til I started using a Mac, but I can’t wait! :)</p>

            <p>Our friends Mark &amp; Emily are on a big quit-your-job-and-travel-the-world kind of trip.  I just happened to catch Mark on instant messanger tonight and had a catch up with someone HALF WAY AROUND THE WORLD.  Before the internet it would have meant an expensive 3 minute phone call.  Instead I had 40 minutes of chat and I could look up maps and sights for where they are <em>right now</em>.</p>

<blockquote>  11 million people in Chengdu, so not that big. ;-)  Though they build these super-wide streets here, so it doesn't seem crowded. But the pollution is awful. You can't see the sun...Yeah, we're literaly one step behind the wrecking ball at all times here. There is almost no old China left.</blockquote>

<p>They have been all over Thailand (narrowly missing the tsunami), Myanmar, Laos, India, Tibet etc.  They had told amazing stories of the people, the places, the color, their volunteer work, and, of course, sickness (in email NOT a blog, tsk).  Giving away warm clothes for beach wear, then dropping shorts to buy warm clothes again, and now they are on another cycle for warm clothes.  Their idea of luxury is a double bed and flushing toilet (even manual – don’t ask if you don’t know what I mean).  From their latest dispatch:</p>

<blockquote>We set out from Delhi by a horrid night bus to Rajastan, a state that is simply everything and everyone foreign you've ever imagined in your entire life. Bedouins, Moghuls, gypsies, nomads, snake charmers, men brandishing sabers and scarabs, people looking as if they'd just stepped off a flying carpet or arrived in a caravan of tents, tea, and camels or errupted in a puff from a bottle to grant you three wishes, It is no stretch to call it storybook--it's like living and wandering through a childhood dreamland. Totally amazing...forts rising from the desert sands, gilded pallaces of the Maharaja, trains of camels, elephants ridden through the streets, and each village with entirely its own character.

A Belgian friend we made in Myanmar warned us that India forces you to "confront the rude part of yourself." It's true, though it forces you to confront many other parts of yourself. Such as: You realize where your compassion gives way to callousness. You become cynical about religion and money. You wonder what power you have to affect anything in the world. You question how base can human beings be. You ponder whether all of this is where society is headed or where it's evolving from. It's as if all of life--cruelty, joy, sadness, hope, despair--occurs in one day and you pass through each of these one after the other.</blockquote>

<p>They are on the home stretch, though I bet they wish I didn’t even use the phrase: due back June 3rd.</p>

<p>Marko says: (7:08:51 PM)</p>

<blockquote>it is really simple, this life. My dad sent us pix of our house yesterday, and we started remembering all the complications of "real" life...</blockquote>

<blockquote>"real" life is overrated</blockquote>

<p>Mark &amp; Emily, look harder each day. You have to <em>see</em> more for the rest of us.</p>

            <p>I love this…. <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=123897">Velvetinenut</a> in Singapore made a recipe for kids paints and painted this on their bathroom wall:

<p>If someone told me years ago that someone on the other side of the world would paint the name of a web site I made on their bathroom wall….. :)</p>

            <p>A business acquaintance suggested that we look at <a href="http://adzaar.com">Adzaar</a> for advertising on our web site. <em>Adzaar!</em> That’s the first time we’ve ever seen someone use the same naming scheme that we did with <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a>. Recipezaar: where the recipes are. Adzaar: where the ads are?</p>

<p>And it turns out that the domain name was registered by MRL Ventures, which is <a href="http://www.davidgalbraith.org/">David Galbraith</a>’s venture company and the founder or <a href="http://moreover.com">Moreover.com</a>.</p>

<p>Meaningless to you, but pretty interesting to me. And they have a great idea…. ads on a web site that come from an ad network have a huge problem: the ads don’t come from the site itself. So ad-blocking software in web browsers can easily block the ads completely simply by noticing the domain name is different from the originating site. But Adzaar does it by giving publishers the code to put on their site so ads come from the publisher itself. Web browsers can’t block such ads because a browser can’t know whether content is an ad or is content.</p>

<p>I’m not a big fan of advertising, but it’s a fact of the internet that lots of great sites can’t survive without them. But it’s a great idea for a business.</p>
