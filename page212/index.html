          <p>Tom DeLay, who called the judge and Michael Schiavo “terrorists”, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002221334_delay27.html">took his own father off life support 16 years ago</a> and asked the doctors to not resuscitate his father, even though he could have lived, albeit in a vegetative state because his father “wouldn’t have wanted to live like that”.</p>

<p>Moreover, Tom DeLay sued (and won) the company that made the coupling that caused his father’s injury. And Tom DeLay has since spearheaded legislation to protect corporations from such lawsuits.</p>

<p>Do as I say, not as I do.</p>

          <p>Inspired by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/w00kie/sets/180637/">these</a>, I made my own transparent desktop. It’s a fun thing to do on a rainy Seattle saturday.

<p><strong>Update:</strong> So Slashdot gets around to <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/03/27/029216&amp;from=rss">talking about this</a> (remember when Slashdot was first? Now they seem to be last). And the overriding criticism is that people “have too much time on their hands”. From the time I first saw this til the time I had mine up was 15 minutes. And I did it twice (the first one sucked). And I had to run downstairs to find the camera and scrounge around for our tripod (which isn’t needed). And I had to charge the battery.</p>

          <p>The new <a href="http://www.decemberists.com">Decemberists</a> album, <em><a href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/d/decemberists/picaresque.shtml">Picaresque</a></em>, is great.  It’s a bit early, maybe, but I think this will be their masterpiece album, their <em>Boy with the Arab Strap</em> or their <em>OK Computer</em>, the album they’ll be spending the rest of their career trying to match.</p>

<p><em>Cheer them on to their rivals,
‘cause America can, and America can’t say no.
And America does if America says it’s so, it’s so.
And the anchorperson on TV goes
“La-di-da-di-da.”</em>

<p>Speaking of Radiohead and Belle &amp; Sebastian… Radiohead are <a href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/news/05-03/23.shtml">starting</a> their next album and <a href="http://www.belleandsebastian.com/">Belle &amp; Sebastian</a> are releasing <a href="http://www.belleandsebastian.com/newsstory.php?id=222">a “best of” CD</a> – I remember when they were so prolific they couldn’t make CDs fast enough, now they’re just making compilations?!</p>
