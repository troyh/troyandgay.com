          <p>We drove up to Vancouver today for a mini-vacation and to belatedly celebrate  <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=3044">Gay’s birthday</a> since we didn’t really do anything since we were so busy with work. We came to Vancouver last year for Gay’s birthday and had so much fun that we thought we’d do it again this year.</p>

<p>This time we took the “truck route” across the border through <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?oi=map&amp;q=Sumas,+WA">Sumas, Washington</a>. Friends who go to Canada often tell us this is the smart thing to do. Unfortunately, they didn’t tell us that it was smart to bring a passport when going this route, so we caught a bit of gruff from the border patrol (fortunately, I had a voter’s registration card which seemed to make them marginally happy).</p>

<p>We got to <a href="http://www.opushotel.com/">our hotel</a> at 6:30pm and went right to dinner at <a href="http://www.crestaurant.com">C</a>. A (chilly) walk along the marina back to the hotel and here we are. :)</p>

          <p>Why is April 15 Tax Day in the US? I’ve always thought it interesting that it’s as far from Election Day as possible and figured that had to be the reason (since voters tend to vote their pocketbook).  However, the date really <a href="http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20020415.html">has nothing to do</a> with Election Day.</p>

<p>Anyway, here’s some <a href="http://cagle.com/news/Taxes2005/main.asp">Tax Day comics</a>.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2005/04/09/morrissey.html">Who Put the 'M' in Manchester?</a>
        </h3>
        <article>
          <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/morrissey.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I just got <a href="http://morrisseymusic.com">Morrissey</a>’s <em>Who Put the ‘M’ in Manchester?</em> DVD. I’m a huge Morrissey fan… I realized how much recently. I loved The Smiths, of course, but if I were to name my ten favorite artists, I doubt Morrissey would appear on it. Yet every new CD he comes out with I buy and I like them. I don’t even have all The Smiths CDs but I have every Morrissey solo CD. And it wasn’t intentional, so I must really like his music. (I wonder what else I like ;) )</p>

<p>But the highlight of the DVD for me is a Smiths song, <em>There is a Light That Never Goes Out</em>. I haven’t listened to <em>The Queen Is Dead</em> in years so  had forgotten how great this song is. The crowd singing the morbidly romantic chorus is what does it:</p>

<blockquote>And if a double-decker bus
crashes into us,
To die by your side
Is such a heavenly way to die.

And if a 10-ton truck
kills the both of us,
To die by your side,
Well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine.
</blockquote>

<p>His latest CD, <em>You Are The Quarry</em>, is one of his best yet, so it’s great to see him continue to do well in his career.</p>

          <p>Our friends, Steve and Joseph, are in Buenos Aires and are sending us photos. Since he doesn’t have a blog either, I’m posting his most recent photo here. I don’t know what these things are (possums?) but there they are.</p>
