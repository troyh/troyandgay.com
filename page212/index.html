          <p>Continuing my training for <a href="http://www.rnrmarathon.com/">the marathon</a>, I ran 20 miles today.  For the first time after a long run, I actually felt like it was <em>possible</em> to go farther at the end.  I am uncertain how much father, because the last 2 miles were not so fun – especially after a huge blister on the bottom of my right big toe popped with a mile left.  Very startling.  I had been more uptight than usual before starting –  I didn’t eat very well last night, I was trying out new shorts, my socks didn’t match.  These things are very worrisome when you are about to run for 3 hours or so, and my superstition about the socks was proven with the blister.  I think the biggest factor, in what I thought was a great performance, was having something to eat along the way.  My running partner, Laura, has reintroduced me to the wonders of gummybears (what is the flavor of the clear one anyways?), and I tried one of those <a href="http://www.clifbar.com/eat/eat.cfm?location=shot">goo packets</a> at mile 10.  The sensation of eating something without chewing is completely alien, and not recommended.  My mouth really wanted to reject it, but in the end I think the extra energy was really crucial.  I’m feeling pretty tapped out now, and it just started hailing, so I’m pretty glad to be done.</p>

<p>We also played a very sucessful <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/sitenews/post.php?pid=128">April Fool’s Day joke on the site</a> today too.</p>

          <p>Wow, even Fox News, the “What To Think Network”, is <a href="http://www.newshounds.us/2005/03/27/white_house_to_fox_news_steer_clear_of_schiavo.php">running scared of the Terri Schiavo story now</a>. Great quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
"Fox finally found an issue it couldn't brainwash the public into supporting."

"All of the fanatics where handed a new scapegoat on a silver platter, Jeb Bush. Goes to show how fickle and dangerous fanatics can be."

        <article>
          <p>Tom DeLay, who called the judge and Michael Schiavo “terrorists”, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002221334_delay27.html">took his own father off life support 16 years ago</a> and asked the doctors to not resuscitate his father, even though he could have lived, albeit in a vegetative state because his father “wouldn’t have wanted to live like that”.</p>

<p>Moreover, Tom DeLay sued (and won) the company that made the coupling that caused his father’s injury. And Tom DeLay has since spearheaded legislation to protect corporations from such lawsuits.</p>

<p>Do as I say, not as I do.</p>

          <p>Inspired by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/w00kie/sets/180637/">these</a>, I made my own transparent desktop. It’s a fun thing to do on a rainy Seattle saturday.

<p><strong>Update:</strong> So Slashdot gets around to <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/03/27/029216&amp;from=rss">talking about this</a> (remember when Slashdot was first? Now they seem to be last). And the overriding criticism is that people “have too much time on their hands”. From the time I first saw this til the time I had mine up was 15 minutes. And I did it twice (the first one sucked). And I had to run downstairs to find the camera and scrounge around for our tripod (which isn’t needed). And I had to charge the battery.</p>
