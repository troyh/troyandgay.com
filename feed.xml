        <title>Power Outage</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As we were putting the kids to bed during a wind storm tonight, the power went out. All 3 were unnerved by it. This was a common Fall and Winter occurrence when we lived on Vashon Island but the kids were too young to remember those outages. It’s rare in the city so this was new to them. The power company predicted we’d be without power until noon tomorrow. The kids didn’t like that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Havana did not want to go to sleep with the power out, even though her room was always dark at night (but maybe slightly less dark).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hudson wanted to know how long it would take to have it fixed and didn’t understand why it would take so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eva didn’t understand at all that electricity even existed and had a difficult time understanding that the lights just don’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Havana and Eva ended up sleeping together in Havana’s bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of electricity and I find it frustrating that in a modern city in a modern country that we have power outages when the wind blows. But I enjoyed this one. Gay and I had a quiet night reading by candlelight. The power came back at 10:30pm, I caught the last 5 minutes of the Huskies game.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Last Soccer Game</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was the last game of the season for Hudson’s soccer team. They won, 7-3, with 3 goals by Hudson and finished the season &lt;em&gt;undefeated&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Monday Morning Meeting</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Havana’s 2nd grade class ran the (K-5, a.k.a. Lower School’s) Monday Morning Meeting this week, which is a big deal. They did a presentation on composting (only in Seattle!) and Havana gave the finalé, thanking everyone for coming, ushering the 5th graders out and reminding everyone to compost.

&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_4993.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Title&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While leaving, we found Hudson’s story drawing:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Barley is 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is Barley’s first birthday. He’s grown quite a bit since we got him 10 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/barley1year.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We gave him steak for dinner and a tiny cupcake for dessert.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Grrls</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Of all the shoes to choose from, Havana picked purple &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drmartens.com/us/&quot;&gt;Dr Martens&lt;/a&gt; boots. How is she so cool at 7?! Here she is modeling them with Eva, who is proud of her new boots too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_4940.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Title&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, Eva does like to wear her skirts pulled up high in front, we only ask her to cover her butt in the back.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>You Never Forget</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Havana and Hudson recently learned to ride their bikes without training wheels.They’ve been riding with just one training wheel for a while and several weeks ago felt confident enough to ask me to take the other wheel off. I did, but we’re both frustrated by the difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, Hudson went with me to the bike shop so I could get some patch kits and he wanted a water bottle “like the Tour de France riders have”. I told him he could get one when he learns to ride his bike. That became the motivation for him. He immediately started trying to ride his bike in the basement. He had some success right away and that (plus some encouragement) got him through about an hour of frustrating falling down. By dinner time he was doing loops around the basement and was very proud of himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video src=&quot;/video/IMG_0007.mp4&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Havana saw him riding and was excited for him — he was less encouraging of her as she learned over the next couple days. She went out with me and Hudson for a couple nights as I walked Barley and Hudson  rode his bike. Like Hudson, the switch turned on suddenly and she was riding too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video src=&quot;/video/IMG_0001_2.mp4&quot; controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;video src=&quot;/video/IMG_0002_2.mp4&quot; controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;video src=&quot;/video/IMG_0003_2.mp4&quot; controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my earliest memories is learning to ride a bike. That free feeling from riding a bike for the first time is something I haven’t forgotten and what I see in the kids today. It’s fun to see how excited and proud they get at their accomplishment, which I guess is the payoff of parenthood.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Huskies vs Stanford</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I took Hudson to the Huskies game today. He couldn’t see when everyone stood up and was “overheating” in the sun. He made it to halftime before a bathroom break, a pretzel and a cupcake. We spent the 2nd half on the concourse in the shade. Huskies lost 20-13 but it was a close game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/img_4895.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/img_4895.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_4895.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the game, Chloe came to babysit and Gay and I went out to dinner at &lt;a href=&quot;http://terraplata.com/&quot;&gt;Terra Plata&lt;/a&gt; before a great talk by &lt;a href=&quot;http://robertreich.org/&quot;&gt;Robert Reich&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.townhallseattle.org/&quot;&gt;Town Hall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
