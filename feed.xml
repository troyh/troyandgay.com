        <title>Brewery delivery day</title>

&lt;p&gt;The trucks were to arrive this morning to &lt;a href=&quot;http://optimismbrewing.com/news/4589f80e314a4a15e2568729ce6af0e87e3ac685&quot;&gt;deliver all the brewing equipment&lt;/a&gt;. My phone rang at 7am and I was greeted to a gruff truck driver asking for directions and dropping the f-bomb unnecessarily. Gay and I got to the brewery at 8 or so while they were finishing unloading that first truck. The other truck drivers were much more friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dropping the big kids off at school, Gerene brought Eva by the brewery to check it out. She likes climbing up to the mezzanine and found some sawdust to play with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5445.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Title&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our friend Steve, who works across the street at the Polyclinic, also stopped by to check out the activity and get a tour of the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a long day. Gay and I, but mostly Gay, spent the day as a flagger holding a Stop sign to block the street for the trucks. We had a great lunch at the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://meatandbread.ca/capitol-hill/todays-menu/&quot;&gt;Meat &amp;amp; Bread&lt;/a&gt; practically next door. By the afternoon, I was bored and volunteered to remove the protective wrap from the tanks while the guys moved all the tanks in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hudson’s first game of the spring season was today. I think the score was 9-3, Hudson says 11-2. Either way, I sense another undefeated season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5432.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://bluemoonburgers.com/locations/&quot;&gt;Blue Moon Burgers&lt;/a&gt; for dinner. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Space Needle 2015</title>
        <description>&lt;!--

&lt;p&gt;Gay’s mom, and my favorite mother-in-law, is in town this week. She likes to have a fancy dinner when she comes to Seattle so we made reservations at the Space Needle restaurant. She was last at the Space Needle during the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_21_Exposition&quot;&gt;World’s Fair in 1962,&lt;/a&gt; which it was built for. It’s a work-of-art, it still looks modern and futuristic 52 years later! The kids have never been there. I think I was last there in 1997. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5391.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Title&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5396.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Title&quot; /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t like touristy stuff but it was a lot of fun, it didn’t feel very touristy. The restaurant revolves a full turn every 45 minutes, which the kids thought was super-cool, so the view is constantly changing and it’s a view of Seattle you don’t see often. We live in a beautiful city, I never tire of seeing the mountains, water, architecture, greenery, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5398.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Title&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner, we went to the observation deck which has these cool touch screens that show a 360° view and let you go to any date and time and even watch time-lapse videos: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5408.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Title&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Even more impressive, it was made by Microsoft!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.empmuseum.org&quot;&gt;EMP Museum&lt;/a&gt; is near the Space Needle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5417.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Title&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always thought that the EMP, despite being designed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gehry&quot;&gt;Frank Gehry&lt;/a&gt;, is an eyesore from a distance, so much that I’ve avoided ever going to it. But up close it looks great. One day I’ll have to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;http://car2go.com&quot;&gt;car2go&lt;/a&gt; for the first time, we went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonbrewersguild.org/Events.html&quot;&gt;Cask beer festival&lt;/a&gt; with Jon &amp;amp; Megan and then to &lt;a href=&quot;http://tayloroysterbars.com/locations/queen-anne/&quot;&gt;Taylor Shellfish&lt;/a&gt; for oysters. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Havanas 9th &amp; 10th teeth</title>
        <description>&lt;!--
date: 2015-03-25
tags: Havana 
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Havana lost not one, but two!, teeth today. Gerene actually pulled them out for her. Havana decided to try an experiment: she told Gerene, Hudson and Eva not to tell me or Gay so she could see if the Tooth Fairy showed up. She has been suspicious that the Tooth Fairy is not real and that it is her parents that leave the note and money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5367.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Title&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impressively, she and her brother and sister kept it a secret all day and evening. The next morning, she announced that she knows the Tooth Fairy is real because she did visit! Her &lt;em&gt;scientific method&lt;/em&gt; makes me proud. And she was very happy to have her belief in the Tooth Fairy restored. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5369.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Title&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been 4 months since &lt;a href=&quot;http://troyandgay.com/2014/11/15/Havana-lost%20another%20tooth.html&quot;&gt;she lost her 8th tooth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gay wanted to have her 45th birthday party at the brewery but it’s not ready yet. While &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troy_h/status/579691093123473408&quot;&gt;at brunch this morning&lt;/a&gt;, we decided to have a few friends over to the brewery for a miniature party instead. Jon, Megan, Dierdre and Patrick joined us and the kids for some beer and pizza tonight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5353.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Title&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kids got to climb up to the mezzanine and run around — they quickly became ladder experts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5358.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Title&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It got cold at the building so we went home for cake and shuffleboard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching &lt;a href=&quot;Link&quot;&gt;Maps to the Stars&lt;/a&gt; starring Julianne Moore as a character named “Havana”. Hey, &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; invented naming people Havana! I knew I should’ve trademarked the name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too bad the movie wasn’t very good. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5326.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
Eva got her first bicycle today at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.montlakebike.com/&quot;&gt;Montlake Bicycle Shop&lt;/a&gt; and this weekend I installed our bike wall in the mud room. I put 2 sheets of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sabic-ip.com/gep/Plastics/en/ProductsAndServices/ProductLine/lexan.html&quot;&gt;Lexan&lt;/a&gt; on the wall to protect it from wet/dirty tires and mounted 5 hooks to hold the bikes and keep them out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5325.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kids are amazed that the bikes “stick” to the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
