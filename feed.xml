        <title>Field trip to CenturyLink</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Havana’s class took a field trip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.centurylinkfield.com&quot;&gt;CenturyLink field&lt;/a&gt;, the home of the Seahawks. Havana decided she wants to be a writer when she grows up because the sportswriters get great seats in the stadium and free food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting facts: It takes all day to paint the field for a game for a football game, half a day for soccer games. For seismic reasons, the stadium consists of 8 “pie pieces” that don’t touch each other and are joined inside by movable plates that cover the gaps. There is only one place in the building that will shake in an earthquake. All 67,000 seats are washed before every game. There are 612 trash/compost/recycling bins at the stadium. It cost $50,000 to ship the Super Bowl XLVIII sign from New York.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My 45th Birthday</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is my 45th birthday. Nothing special, I just relaxed at home, hanging out and reading, had a steak dinner and beers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5036.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Title&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone for my birthday gifts and birthday wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While watching the Oregon vs Stanford game, I drank a bit of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stbcbeer.com/seasonals/seasonal-imperial/pumking-beer-page/&quot;&gt;Pumking&lt;/a&gt;. I used to love this beer every year but not as much anymore… the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacetyl&quot;&gt;diacetyl&lt;/a&gt;, which gives it its characteristic buttery flavor that I used to like, is now headache-inducing. Either it has increased or I’m getting more sensitive to diacetyl. Change is the only constant in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bottle of cider has my name on it!:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Halloween</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The kids dressed as Harry Potter characters. Hudson was Harry Potter, Havana was Hermione and Eva was Crookshanks, Hermione’s cat. The kids with Gerene and Cheryl:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_0265.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first year they all went up to the doors by themselves, we could stay on the sidewalk. They were all excited about sorting their candy and, of course, eating it and that lasted through the next morning too. After that, they forgot about the candy, just like previous years.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Parent-Teacher Conferences</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We went to the parent-teacher conferences for Havana and Hudson. Both are doing great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hudson’s story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5025.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Havana’s favorite feature about herself, her eye lashes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5027.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Havana wrote a story about her first cross-country meet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5030.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5028.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, she thinks she used to live in Washington, DC. I think she gets confused between Washington, DC and Washington State and/or she thinks that because I grew up there she thinks she did too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Havana thinks of school:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Power Outage</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As we were putting the kids to bed during a wind storm tonight, the power went out. All 3 were unnerved by it. This was a common Fall and Winter occurrence when we lived on Vashon Island but the kids were too young to remember those outages. It’s rare in the city so this was new to them. The power company predicted we’d be without power until noon tomorrow. The kids didn’t like that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Havana did not want to go to sleep with the power out, even though her room was always dark at night (but maybe slightly less dark).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hudson wanted to know how long it would take to have it fixed and didn’t understand why it would take so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eva didn’t understand at all that electricity even existed and had a difficult time understanding that the lights just don’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Havana and Eva ended up sleeping together in Havana’s bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of electricity and I find it frustrating that in a modern city in a modern country that we have power outages when the wind blows. But I enjoyed this one. Gay and I had a quiet night reading by candlelight. The power came back at 10:30pm, I caught the last 5 minutes of the Huskies game.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Last Soccer Game</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was the last game of the season for Hudson’s soccer team. They won, 7-3, with 3 goals by Hudson and finished the season &lt;em&gt;undefeated&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Coach Dave:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Monday Morning Meeting</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Havana’s 2nd grade class ran the (K-5, a.k.a. Lower School’s) Monday Morning Meeting this week, which is a big deal. They did a presentation on composting (only in Seattle!) and Havana gave the finalé, thanking everyone for coming, ushering the 5th graders out and reminding everyone to compost.
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_4984.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Title&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_4993.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Title&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While leaving, we found Hudson’s story drawing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_4995.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Title&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and Havana front-and-center in the school fundraiser campaign poster:&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is Barley’s first birthday. He’s grown quite a bit since we got him 10 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/barley1year.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We gave him steak for dinner and a tiny cupcake for dessert.&lt;/p&gt;
