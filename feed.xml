&lt;p&gt;The best rental car I’ve ever had, a BMW 740i!:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5691.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Title&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a fun car to drive. Amazingly, it only cost $275 (plus taxes, etc)  for 7 days. That’s less than $40/day. The kids liked it too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried to go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.monkeypodkitchen.com/&quot;&gt;Monkeypod&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday for dinner but discovered that you can’t even get into the place without a reservation, which we didn’t make. So we made a reservation for Friday dinner. This is considered by some to be the best (only?) beer restaurant on Maui. The food was excellent, one of the best meals we had here, and the beer selection is fantastic by Hawaii standards (even good by Seattle standards). &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Happy 8th Birthday, Havana</title>

&lt;p&gt;To start Havana’s 8th birthday, we went for brunch at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grandwailea.com&quot;&gt;The Grand Wailea&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5640.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Title&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we went down to the pool. The pool is very cool with caves, waterfalls and several different areas of varying depth joined by waterways. There’s also a beach area with sand for the little kids.  Havana quickly met another girl and they spent the morning and afternoon going all around the pool and the slides. She got a bit of a sunburn on her face. Hudson and Eva stayed with us and we stayed in the kids pool area took them down the slides a few times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For dinner, we went to a luau:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Maui Brewing Company</title>

&lt;p&gt;We got a sitter for the kids so Gay and I could go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mauibrewingco.com/&quot;&gt;Maui Brewing Co &lt;/a&gt;for a brewery tour today. The sitter was great, the kids loved her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5622.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Title&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maui Brewing was fun. We started with a beer, a Kölsch and a Czech pils, and tacos from the lunch-time food truck, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/slightlysalty808?ref=stream&quot;&gt;Slightly Salty&lt;/a&gt;. They even gave us the “industry discount”: free beers! Then we took the tour. This was their new brewery, a 42,000 square foot place that they built last year and only opened the tap room 4 months ago. They have two brew houses, a 25bbl and a 50bbl, a well-equipped laboratory, a large yeast propagation system, a centrifuge, a canning line, capacity for 150,000 bbls with plenty more space to grow, and are working on being 100% solar-powered. They are also in construction of a large pub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, their best-selling beer on the mainland is the Coconut Porter. I like to see dark beers being popular. In Hawaii, not surprisingly, their Bikini Blonde, which is a delicious Helles that I’ve been enjoying the most this week, is their best-seller.  Their Big Swell IPA is also easy to find in Hawaii, also good. But at the brewery they have 20 or more taps of other beers. I got a sampler of these: a doppelbock, a coffee doppelbock (that’s a new one for me), a Vienna lager, an alt, a dry stout and a double IPA.  All were very good, I’d like to go back for a pint of that Doppelbock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took over 7 months but I &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; registered &lt;a href=&quot;http://optimism.beer&quot;&gt;optimism.beer&lt;/a&gt; today. I’ve registered lots of domains over the years and they all took seconds to complete. Not this one…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The registrar for &lt;code&gt;.beer&lt;/code&gt; started taking requests for domains in September 2014. I put in my request and then they went silent to me – I couldn’t get any response via email or phone. Eventually, they added an online chat tech support feature to their web site which got me in contact with a person. I was promised I’d have the domain registered that day. That day was February 11. Since then I was told various “technical problems” are preventing them from registering domains. I stopped trying for many weeks and today, on a whim while on vacation, I tried to register it through their web site and this time it worked. Now I need to see if I can transfer it to my favorite registrar to avoid similar problems in the future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I taught the kids to play checkers and then refereed a best-3-out-of-5 tournament between Havana and Hudson. Sadly, I had to look up the rules to checkers.

&lt;p&gt;We’re flying to Hawaii for a week. This is our 2nd trip to Hawaii, the first was with Havana in 2007 when she was just 6 months old. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the plane:&lt;/p&gt;
