        <title>Boys Weekend</title>

&lt;p&gt;Gay decided to take the kids to Spokane to surprise her mom for her 75th birthday this weekend. That meant me and Barley had some quality time together. Being a thoughtful wife, Gay discovered &lt;a href=&quot;http://munchery.com&quot;&gt;Munchery&lt;/a&gt; and had dinner delivered to me Friday and Saturday night. Here’s Friday night’s dinner, eggplant Parmesan, roasted tomato soup, a coconut cream pie for dessert, plus a snickerdoodle cookie:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5264.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I had to do was heat everything up and eat. It was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I’d be without the kids on the weekend, I time-shifted my Friday to Saturday and brewed a batch of beer on Saturday. I finished just as Munchery was delivering my Saturday dinner. I ate dinner and spent the rest of the evening watching movies with Barley. Here’s Barley enjoying our time together:&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t drink a lot of wheat beers but I love the look of the glass, I find it downright adorable. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Omega Ouzeri</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Gay and I went to Seattle’s newest Greek restaurant, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omegaouzeri.com/&quot;&gt;Omega Ouzeri&lt;/a&gt;. It’s from the guy who did &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vioscafe.com/vioscapitolhill.html&quot;&gt;Vios&lt;/a&gt;, a more casual Greek restaurant a couple blocks from our house. I love Greek food and Seattle has too few Greek restaurants and even fewer good ones. The food at Omega was excellent — I had a deconstructed gyro—  and reminded me that I don’t drink enough ouzo.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Seahawks lose Super Bowl 49</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Seahawks lost a game they should have won. It was a depressing end to a great season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love that I can care so much about something that I know doesn’t really matter. That’s a great thing about sports. The Seahawks lost the Super Bowl in a painful way and it feels like a horrible thing for a while, but it feels great at the same time realizing that &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; life goes on unaffected… I have my health and happiness, my wife and kids are great, happy and healthy too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Seattle Seahawks Second Straight Superbowl</title>
        <description>&lt;!---

&lt;p&gt;Unbelievable game today. The Seahawks offense couldn’t do anything right for the first 56 minutes, including 5 turnovers, and it seemed like certain defeat. The defense kept it close, making key goal line stops forcing early FGs and several 3-and-outs late. Then the offense exploded to score &lt;em&gt;15 points in 44 seconds&lt;/em&gt;, taking the lead 22-19. The Packers tied it at 22-22 to go to overtime where the Seahawks took 6 plays in 3 minutes 19 seconds to score the winning touchdown and win 28-22 to go to Super Bowl XLIX. This is why I watch (some) sports. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched the game two more times to convince myself it really happened. It was a fitting end to the game that Jermaine Kearse caught the winning touchdown after &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; 4 previous passes to him were intercepted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Seattle Times published these cut-outs that Dierdre &amp;amp; Patrick brought over for the kids to make:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IMG_5212.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Title&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seahawks doughnuts for breakfast is becoming a game day tradition around here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eva had a big spill at school today, running and falling on pavement, giving her abrasions on her chin and knees and really banged her front teeth and gums. Gay had to go get her and take her to the dentist for a checkup on her teeth. Fortunately, her permanent teeth appear to be okay and shouldn’t be affected. A 2nd dental checkup coming next week.&lt;/p&gt;
