              <p>Already this year, we’ve added 3 servers to keep up with the volume of traffic on <a href="http://recipezaar.com">the site</a> and expect to add at least 3 more by the end of the year. The other day all the pieces arrived to build the next new server for the site. I get a lot of satisfaction building a machine from scratch, but it’s always been a painful experience with the seemingly endless hardware troubles. This was the smoothest one yet, except I spent 3 hours last night fiddling with the machine trying to get it to power up. I gave up at 1am and went to bed.</p>

<p>I woke up, spent some time reading message boards and newsgroups to help diagnose the problem (how would I have done this before the internet? Call Taiwan for tech support?!). Not optimistic, I went for a bike ride while the morning weather was great rather than spend more frustrating hours tinkering to find out it’s raining. When I got back, I tried a few things that didn’t work and then figured, as a last shot, a different video card. <em>It worked!</em> The problem was that the (very reliable, until now) video card wasn’t working which made it appear the machine was not powering up. It was, I just couldn’t see anything on the monitor. That’s great, but I can’t believe I wasted 3 hours on a stupid video card.</p>

<p>Now it’s all just software to finish this machine, which is the easy part (for me). This machine should take us quite a ways down the road til the next upgrade.</p>

              <p>It’s sad when good people die so young and especially when due to something as random as an icy sidewalk. Robert Atkins <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/04/17/obit.atkins/index.html">died today</a> at 72. He was a brave guy to defy conventional wisdom and present an alternative plan for a healthy diet. I’m sure millions of people owe their lives and happiness to this man.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Our good friend Mark has just returned home from a couple of years working in England and Holland.  Yet another great story of leaving a going-nowhere, make-you-unhappy job with cushy amenities, like living abroad and the promise of paper money, for a radical life change.  Mark is going back to school to become a commercial photographer.  Lee is also considering a new (third) career and perhaps school.  Unfortunately Lee is Mark’s boyfriend and British, which pretty much makes it impossible for him to work here.  Even going to school will be difficult, though he can get a visa (if accepted) he won’t be able to work to support himself.  In England, they’d only have to register as domestic partners: same as being married.  Makes me so sad that our stupid country is so backwards on this, and causing them so much stress.</p>

              <p>Normally, I wouldn’t bother too much with the status of someone’s marriage, but this is bigger than a marriage, it’s about the Tour. I’m glad that <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=ap-armstrong-marriage&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns">Lance Armstrong and his wife are reconciling</a>. I’d really like to see him win a 5th straight Tour de France this year and go on to do what no one has ever done and win a 6th next year. Did I ever mention that I met Lance at the start of Stage 2 of the Tour DuPont in 1995?</p>
