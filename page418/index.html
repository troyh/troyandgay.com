          </h3>
            <p>My (geeky) excitement is that I bought two <a href="http://valinux.com">VA Linux</a> machines on <a href="http://ebay.com">eBay</a>. I’ve always wanted a VA Linux server; they’re well-built machines and they are/were the “Dell of Linux”. But now that they’ve gotten out of the hardware biz, I think it’s cool that I own a piece of Wall Street history from the great dot-com bubble – VA Linux was the <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/log/1999/12/10/va_linux/">biggest IPO</a> in stock market history surging 698% the first day and it’ll likely be a decade or more before that record is broken.</p>

<p>By today’s standards, these machines are fairly low-powered (about 1/3 the speed of the other servers that run Recipezaar). But they were also very inexpensive and more than enough for their intended use.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>After a couple weeks, this site is back. We had to take it down as we worked on the hardware for <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com">the site</a> and, as always, things took longer than expected so this was down for too long. But now it’s all together again and running on a new machine.</p>

            <p>Had good friends John and Deborah Bender over for dinner and drinks – I should probably say ‘drinks with a little dinner’.  Had <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/18487">Blue Cheese Beef Tenderloin</a> (but with a rib-eye roast instead), <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/49559">Leek Risotto</a>, a salad and <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/50264">Chocolate Fudge Brownies</a> with ice cream.  Boys enjoyed a narrow lead over the girls in 20th Century Trivial Pursuit before we had to call it quits.</p>
