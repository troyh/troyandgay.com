        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Today marks the end of a frustrating week for me. Building another new server for <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> has been difficult and time-consuming and the 2am nights haven’t left much room for sleep. Yes, we build <em>everything</em> ourselves, from software to hardware – we even make our own ethernet cables! Why? Because I’m a big believer that it’s always best to fully understand how the important things work, plus its fun and cost-effective. That was the theory anyway. But it feels like the worst is behind me now. The rest is just software.</p>

<p>On top of that (and my two flat tires on my bike in one day), twice this week my Mac had “kernel panics”. The screen went grey and a <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=107061&amp;SaveKCWindowURL=http%3A%2F%2Fkbase.info.apple.com%2Fcgi-bin%2FWebObjects%2Fkbase.woa%2Fwa%2FSaveKCToHomePage&amp;searchMode=Assisted&amp;kbhost=kbase.info.apple.com&amp;showButton=true&amp;randomValue=100&amp;showSurvey=false&amp;sessionID=9460704!troy@recipezaar.com%7C166457042">white box</a> popped up and told me, in four languages, that I need to restart. But I must say that Macs are pretty even when they crash. From looking at the panic.log that OS X made, it looks like it has something to do with audio. Will send to Apple for advice.</p>

          <p><a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> broke the 10,000 barrier on <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details?q=recipezaar&amp;p=DestSearch_W_t_40_M1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.recipezaar.com%2F">Alexa</a>! We’re now at 9,610. This means that if you ranked all the web sites in popularity, we’re the 9,610th most popular site. Not bad for a couple geeks banging away on computers above their garage, and considering that there are zillions of sites on the web. :)</p>

<p>Of course, this is just one web ranking system and no ranking system is perfectly accurate, so it must be taken with a pinch of salt. But it’s as good a metric as any. I also love that we have a great 5-star review rating on Alexa, more total reviews and more 5-stars than any of our competitors.</p>

          <p><a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/03/03/14/1534218.shtml?tid=95">10 years ago today</a> the first web browser, <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">NCSA</a>’s <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Divisions/Communications/MosaicHistory/history.html">Mosaic</a>, was announced. I wish I could remember the first time I browsed the web, but I don’t think I was on the web til later in ‘93 or probably even ‘94. I probably said something like “big deal, it’s just a glorified <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/T/Telnet.html">telnet</a>, <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/G/Gopher.html">gopher</a> and <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/F/Ftp.html">ftp</a>”. :)  I do remember setting up my own web server running on my desktop machine at work, which was connected directly to the internet <strong>without a firewall</strong>. Those were the days before internet crime.</p>
