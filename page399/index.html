          <p>I just (re)discovered <a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/online/index.html">The Visual Thesaurus</a>.  Granted, they don’t have a large data set yet, but I think the spider diagram is actually a very effective representation…much better than the traditional Roget’s double look-up.  Wonder how we could represent related recipes or similar chefs this way – am I too obsessed that this was my first thought?  (Met the founder of this company when he was working with my friend <a href="http://www.netomat.com/company/people/management.php#Cindy_Pound">Cindy</a> at <a href="http://www.razorfish.com">Razorfish</a>)</p>

          <p>We completely redid the recipe pages on the site, which will result in a much faster system and much better caching system, similar to the way the browse pages are done. But it looks like there’s a few minor bugs on the recipe page. Not bad for the amount of work we did last week on this, though.</p>

          <p>In just the first week, Apple’s Music Store <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2003/may/05musicstore.html">sold 1 million songs</a>. In comparison, the other online music services have sold on the order of thousands or tens of thousands of songs in 6+ months <em>combined</em>. This is also impressive given that it’s US only and Mac users only. It just goes to show, give people what they want and people will pay for it.</p>

          <p>Had friends over for dinner last night: Megan, her boyfriend John, Serene, Dave, Reid, Eric, Valerie and lots of dogs. Megan &amp; John brought appetizers with her roasted red pepper dip &amp; bruschetta, Serene &amp; Dave brought a great salad and growlers of yummy local micro-beer. Eric &amp; Valerie brought us a bottle of wine straight from France, which we stashed away for later. We barbecued hamburgers and had <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/recipe/getrecipe.zsp?id=52840">Cocoa-Buttermilk Cake</a> for dessert.</p>

<p>I woke up at 6am and couldn’t get back to sleep (probably a function of the wine). I stayed up til 9am, did some work, and then fell asleep til after noon.</p>

          <p>Gay ran off to Seattle to see friends tonight. I stayed home working. Had a couple <a href="http://www.fullers.co.uk/">Fuller’s</a> beers (an 1845 and an ESB) and worked all night listening to <a href="http://www.radiohead.com/">Radiohead</a>, <a href="http://www.roxymusic.co.uk/">Roxy Music</a> and <a href="http://www.arabstrap.co.uk/">Arab Strap</a>.</p>
