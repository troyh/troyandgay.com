            <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/22/technology/circuits/22comp.html">This is good news</a> about a drop in enrollment in computer science at universities due to the dot-com bust. This is similar to the few years before I started college where enrollment in CS dropped because kids realized they wouldn’t be playing video games all day.</p>

            <p>We saw <a href="http://www.dreamworks.com/catchthem/jump2.html">Catch Me If You Can</a> last night. Very entertaining and the set design was incredible. Even more interesting because it’s based on <a href="http://www.abagnale.com/facomments.html">a true story</a>.</p>

            <p>Had a morning meeting with a neighbor and her web designer about setting up <a href="http://vashonisland.net">VashonIsland.net</a> and making it a great local community web site for Vashon Island.</p>

            <p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2003/05/20/news/buffett_tax/index.htm">Warren Buffet on the dividend tax cut</a>:</p>

<p>_Buffett posed a hypothetical situation in which Berkshire Hathaway, which does not currently pay a dividend, paid $1 billion in dividends next year.</p>

<p>Through his 31 percent ownership of the company, Buffett said he would receive an additional $310 million in income that would reduce his tax rate from about 30 percent to 3 percent, while his office secretary would still have a tax rate of about 30 percent._</p>

<p>The government needs to stop trying to stimulate the economy by getting people to buy things they don’t need/want and start stimulating it by getting companies to build things people need/want to buy. In the tech industry, the weak Microsoft settlement (they settled a case they won!) delayed any hope that the tech industry will be providing new and interesting products for people. Maybe Coca-Cola will come out with a new drink everyone wants or Nike will invent the $500 shoe that all the kids have to have.</p>
