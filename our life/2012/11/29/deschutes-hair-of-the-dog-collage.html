    <p>Wow, this is quite a beer. I opened it because it was in a 12 oz bottle and I started watching Thursday Night Football. The first sip was incredible. I googled it and found <a href="http://www.beerpulse.com/2012/03/deschutes-hair-of-the-dogs-collaboration-beer-collage-hitting-the-market-in-may/">this</a>: </p>

<blockquote>The beer is a blend of two Deschutes beers, The Stoic and The Dissident, as well as two Hair of the Dog beers, Fred and Adam. All four were brewed at Deschutes’ facility in Bend in March of 2010. All four were then aged in a variety of wooden barrels for two years including Rye Whiskey, Cognac, Sherry, Pinot Noir, Bourbon, used American Oak which previously held beer, new American Oak, and new Oregon Oak.

<p>This is just fantastic and a beer that should be drank very slowly with dinner or a movie, not a Saints vs Falcons game on Thursday night. Oh well, I’ll take responsibility for my mistake and drink it. </p>
