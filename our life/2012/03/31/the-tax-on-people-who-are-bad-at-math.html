    <p>Americans spent $1.5 billion on lottery tickets just for this one. 25% of that, $375 million, pays for government services. 44 states participate, so on average, my state received $8.5 million. With a population of 6.8 million, I receive $1.25 in government services for free. Even better, <a href="http://m.cbsnews.com/storysynopsis.rbml?pageType=eveningNews&amp;catid=57407364&amp;feed_id=29">Americans spend $56 billion</a> on lottery tickets every year, or 37 times as much, so I receive an estimated $46.25 in government services every year without spending a penny. Thatâ€™s $231.25 for my family each year. Thank you lottery players, keep it up!</p>
