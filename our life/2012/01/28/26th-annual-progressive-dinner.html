    <p>Our street’s 26th Annual Progressive Dinner was tonight. This was our second, <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/01/29/progressive-dinner-2011/">we went last year</a> for the first time. This year, we hosted the appetizer course and Gay made a few dishes. People started arriving at 5pm and we all left to the main course down at the Farrell’s house at 7. By 9:30 or so we were at the Zorn’s for dessert and the awarding of the Garden Award, which means we got rid of it from last year! We were among the last to leave and we were home at 10:45pm. We already know most of the people but we met a couple of neighbors we hadn’t yet met. It’s a great street to live on!</p>
