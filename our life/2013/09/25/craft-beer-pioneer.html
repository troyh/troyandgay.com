    <p>Gay and I had coffee this morning with <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redhook_Ale_Brewery">Paul Shipman</a>, a co-founder of Red Hook Brewery, one of the first craft breweries in America. We met at Starbucks, the first business the other founder of Red Hook created. </p>

<p>I was reminded about one of my trips to Seattle visiting Microsoft in 1996… Before I left for the airport, I ran around Seattle looking for Red Hook’s <a href="http://redhook.com/beers/blueline/?redhook-age-verification=1">Double Black Stout</a>, a stout brewed with Starbucks coffee, a unique beer at the time. I found 2 bottles and carried them home on the plane (try that today!).</p>

<p>In other Starbucks news, we learned today why the owners of the building were so difficult to deal with during lease negotiations for our brewery months ago: they <a href="http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2013/09/spilling-the-beans-starbucks-building-giant-coffee-roaster-and-cafe-at-base-of-capitol-hill/">leased it to Starbucks for a huge local coffee roastery</a>. There’s no shame losing to Starbucks.</p>
