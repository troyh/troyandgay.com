<p>This jersey has turned Hudson into a football nut. The next day after getting it he woke up and got dressed in it before coming down for breakfast, which never happens. He wears it every day and begs people to play football with him all day long. </p>

<p>The games are predetermined: he tells you who you are and whether you are supposed to win or lose the game. The game is the same play over and over:  he explains where the blue line is and where the yellow line is, then he hikes the ball to you, you throw it to him and he runs away from you, while you, who instantly switched teams, are supposed to tackle him. Sometimes he gets a first down (“crossed the yellow line”) and sometimes he gets a touchdown, depending on what he decides during the play.</p>

<p>He even sleeps with the football under his pillow. Adorable.</p>
