    <p>We took Havana and Eva on the 9:40a ferry while Hudson was at school. We were taking Havana to a preschool we’re trying to get her into in the Fall. We stopped at the house to test some paint colors and wallpaper options we like. Then we went to U Village to look at a few pieces of furniture we liked. We had lunch at the Ram Brewery and then went to the preschool.</p>

<p>When we got there, it was after-school play time and she had fun playing with the other kids and she got to help paint a backdrop for their Spring play they were putting on this week. It’s doubtful she’ll be able to go there because they’re full, but we’re on the waiting list.</p>

<p>We went back to the house and talked with Mark about various things and got updates on work. We left the house at 4:30p, stopped at Talarico’s again for take-out, missed the 5:40p ferry and got on the 6p ferry  – 2 hours to get home, ugh!</p>
