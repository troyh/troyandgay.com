  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Gay turned 41 today. It’s the first time since 2008 that we celebrated her birthday at home. I made dinner tonight and we’re going out to dinner tomorrow night.</p>

<p>She’s more wise, more fun and more beautiful than the day I met her. I met her just before she turned 27. She was successful and a powerful personality at Microsoft then, a difficult thing in a male-dominant environment like Microsoft at the time, and I loved her confidence and ability to make things happen. 14 years later, she’s my wife, business/career partner and the mother to my 3 kids. It’s been a great time for me (less so for her, I’m sure) and I hope it lasts another 80 years.</p>
