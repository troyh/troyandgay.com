  <article class="post-content">
    <p>For this week’s date night we went to <a href="http://sitkaandspruce.com/">Sitka &amp; Spruce</a>, another place we’ve been trying to get to. They also do a bunch of small tasting plates. We got a 5 or 6 dishes and 2 were very good, the others were so-so. Before dinner, we had a cocktail at <a href="http://www.ferdinandthebar.com/home/">Bar Ferdinand</a>, which is in the Melrose Market building just a few feet from Sitka &amp; Spruce. After dinner, we had dessert at <a href="http://larkseattle.com/">Lark</a>, a place we haven’t been to in 7 years or so. I had a delicious fig tart and Gay got a cheese plate.</p>
