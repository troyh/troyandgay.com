    <ol>
  <li>
    <p>I’m thankful that I spend morning, noon and night with Gay every day and yet I want to spend more time with her. I’m thankful for her and for her willingness to be in my life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My kids who teach me over and over how much I love being alive. They also teach me over and over that I must continually improve myself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our house. For the first time in my life, I feel like I live in a home. And I’m thankful that I got to be so involved in its renovation and had so much fun doing it working with great people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Pacific Northwest. I am thankful that I get to live in one of the most beautiful, and reasonably-populated, places in the world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am thankful that I had the opportunity to pursue my life’s dreams and to shape my life the way I wanted to. And even more thankful that I still have that freedom.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m healthy; I’m thankful for the knowledge that one day I won’t be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beer. It’s the icing on the cake for me and I (usually) don’t drink as much of it as I’d like to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Programming. It’s exercise for my brain that I’ve enjoyed for a lifetime. I feel like a kid when I get to write code and solve new little problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My home gym. I wouldn’t exercise if it weren’t for convenient access to exercise equipment. It’s my daily addiction. And I’m thankful specifically for the specific equipment I have that makes exercise fun.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My doctors at PacMed. My life today (and tomorrow) is better because of them.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
