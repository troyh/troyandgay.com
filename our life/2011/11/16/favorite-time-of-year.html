    <p>Fall is my favorite time of year: temperatures are a little cooler, you can smell fireplaces in the air, the leaves turn colors, the best beers of the year start coming out, Halloween, my birthday and my favorite holiday (Thanksgiving) arrives, football is on, and it’s lighter in the morning and darker earlier and the light just feels better to me.</p>

<p>I took this photo while out walking around the neighborhood. I wish I took a photo of the red leaves up ahead, they were so bright red on one side and pink on the other, it looked like Valentine’s Day. Havana would’ve loved it.</p>
