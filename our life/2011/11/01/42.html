  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Today I’m at the meaningful age of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)">42</a>. I’m officially not young any more. Looking back, I was a kid being pulled by a fire inside trying my best with my limited abilities and somehow ended up having a fun, lucky and very fortunate life…</p>

<blockquote>

&gt; 
&gt; I want to dance with this fire
Because it's all that I know
As the spotlight turns towards me
I just try my best to show
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; We are lost
We are freaks
We are crippled
We are weak
We are the heirs
To all the world
&gt; 
&gt; </blockquote>

<p>Looking forward, I want to build a new fire and show my kids and help them build theirs. </p>

<blockquote>

&gt; 
&gt; Let's go
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; Build a fire
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; Down on the empty beach where the waves are crashing high
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; White heat, purify as the sparks fly up into the great black sky
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; Sacrifice these crutches to the crackling flame
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; Stand as silhouettes against the dawn
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; It's far too late to try to sleep now
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; It seems I'm never tired anymore
&gt; 
&gt; </blockquote>

<p>This old song from my youth always seemed so relevant to me. It inspired me then and still seems to.</p>
