    <p>We went to the house this morning to check on progress. The cabinetry, tile and wood trim is still being installed and we saw paint samples that <a href="http://www.nbdesigngroup.net/">Nancy and My</a> had the painters do. Some more were being done when we arrived. It sounds like they’ve finalized most of the colors.

<p>We also checked on the exterior fog coat sample, this time didn’t include a bonding agent, as <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/04/08/long-friday-at-the-house/">we discussed last week</a> with Ryan, Mark and Katie. We’re trying to avoid using a bonding agent. We tried to wash it off with a garden hose and it did appear to come off a little, which implies it won’t adhere to the aggregate in the stucco. Nancy is going to try to find a color that will match or complement the grey/white color of the aggregate so when it does wash off the aggregate, it will look natural.</p>

<p>We hadn’t had lunch and were too hungry to wait for dinner so we went to <a href="http://seriouspiewestlake.com/">the new Serious Pie</a> for an appetizer and a beer – <a href="http://www.schoonerexact.com/">Schooner Exact</a>’s pale ale, which we’ve never had – while we waited for takeout pizzas. I love the new Serious Pie; it still has communal tables but it’s much bigger and in a better location, also closer to our house. It also appears more kid-friendly so I’m looking forward to taking the kids there often. Havana and Hudson even liked the egg pizza (my favorite!), which I didn’t expect.</p>

<p>On the way to the ferry, we stopped at <a href="http://www.thebeerjunction.com/">The Beer Junction</a> to re-stock the fridge with beers (and I picked up an <a href="http://www.ommegang.com/">Ommegang</a> glass), and then back home.</p>
