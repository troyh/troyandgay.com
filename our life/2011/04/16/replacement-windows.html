    <p>We’re working on getting our house on the market and that required that we replace the failing windows. We’re replacing 13 of them, some worse than others, and 5 of them were done today. They would have done all of them but they mis-measured 8 of them (identical ones) so they arrived with windows that were too big. </p>

<p>The lucky new owner is going to get lots of brand new windows.</p>
