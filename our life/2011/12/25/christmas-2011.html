    <p>Early Friday morning we took the kids downtown to see Santa. By Saturday, they were excited for Santa to come. This was the first year that they understood the Santa concept, so Havana came into our bedroom at 6am Sunday morning asking to go down to open the presents. Hudson was already in bed with us, so she woke all three of us up. Eva wasn’t even awake yet so Gay got her and we all went downstairs.</p>

<p>Gay had made a coffee cake on Saturday so we had that and coffee to wake us up. Havana and Hudson were excited to see Santa’s presents by the fireplace and in the stockings. They didn’t finish opening presents until noon because they had to stop to play with the ones they’ve already opened. For lunch, Gay made a strada and we had champagne. So we just relaxed the rest of the day.</p>
