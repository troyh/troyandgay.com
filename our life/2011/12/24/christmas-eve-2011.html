    <p>We had Steve and Renuka and their kids over for Christmas Eve dinner. Steve and I offered to cook the entire dinner. He brought a prime rib over around 2pm and I had most of my dishes prepared and ready to be cooked, as soon as the rib roast was done.</p>

<p>Eric and Sandi stopped by after Eric picked him up at the airport, after flying in from NYC, on their way to Ericâ€™s family in Bellingham. We had drinks and appetizers, oysters and cheese and crackers, and watched the Seahawks game while the meat roasted. We were eating by 6pm and then Steve and I opened the barrel-aged Old Rasputin and had that while the kids watched a movie and Gay and Renuka cleaned up the dishes (ha ha!).</p>
