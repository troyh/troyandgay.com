  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Movers came this morning and moved a bunch of stuff out of the house that we’ve (mostly Gay) been packing up the last few weeks. Our listing agent, <a href="http://www.seattlefineproperties.com/about-Bob-Bennion.asp">Bob Bennion</a>, recommended them and, as expected, did a professional job. The mover is <a href="http://www.bekins.com/moving/">Bekins</a>, which we’ve learned is still a family-owned business dating back to 1891 – our agent’s name is Paul Bekins, from a long list of Bekins’ involved in the family business. You don’t see that very often.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5697311298/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5149/5697311298_9bb31e2265.jpg" alt="IMG_0962" /></a></p>

<p>Then, Megan and Lori, who work for Bob, came over to get the details on the house and for us to sign the paperwork. They also brought a photographer, Buck (drives a Mini), to take photos of the house for the listing. It should go on the market next Wednesday.</p>

<p>We’re pricing it almost 10% below where all the agents suggested we list it at to get it to sell quickly. Coincidentally, it’s the exact price the house was listed at 10 years ago when we bought it! And that was in a buyer’s market and well before the real estate bubble. So someone is going to get all the improvements we’ve done to it for a 2001-level price.</p>
