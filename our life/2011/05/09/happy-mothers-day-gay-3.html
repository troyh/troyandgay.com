    <p>Nothing makes me appreciate my kids’ mother than having to take care of them all day by myself.</p>

<p>Gay, I don’t know how you do it, especially with a 4-month baby too and managing the house renovation, I can barely manage it <em>with</em> your help. You’re on top of everything, from meals to clothes to school to activities for the kids. Having a nanny during the week helps, but you do everything the other 128 hours a week. That they’re great kids proves that I have very little to do with it. I’m glad they have you and since they always call for for mommy, not daddy, I know they are glad they have you too.</p>
