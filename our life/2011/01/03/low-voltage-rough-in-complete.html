  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I thought it would take me 2 days to do the low-voltage rough-in work at the house. 4 weeks later, I was done. I only got to work for half days because I had to travel via ferry each way and I took the week Eva was born off. It ended up taking me 10 half-days, so 5 full days.</p>

<p>Now I have to work on selecting speakers and go back after the drywall is up, probably 8 weeks from now, to install them. Then the painters can paint the grills. After painting is done, I can finish the “trim-out” (putting receptacles and wall plates in) anytime after the house is painted. I’ll also install ladder racks in the basement for the cable runs along the ceiling then.</p>

<p>Since the line-voltage electrical is still going on, I may go back and run a few more speaker wires since the walls are open and it’s easy to do.</p>
