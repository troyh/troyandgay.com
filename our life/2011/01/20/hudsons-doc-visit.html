    <p>When we got home yesterday, Hudson’s eye was pink and infected and he had a fever. It looked like <a href="https://health.google.com/health/ref/Conjunctivitis">pink eye</a>. The pediatrician wanted to get a look at him to see if he had an ear infection or even strep throat, so we scheduled an appointment for today so I decided to go with and do more work at the house. This morning, he looked much better but we went anyway. He’s fine, no ear infection or strep throat.</p>

<p>Gay dropped me off at the house and I got a couple hours to hang out and put up some blocking in the basement. Hudson got to spend some time with us without Havana around too. He’s almost a different person when Havana’s not taking all the attention.</p>
