  <article class="post-content">
    <p>We delivered gifts of wine and chocolate to neighbors whose property adjoins ours to thank them for putting up with construction for the last year and to apologize in advance for the noise coming tomorrow.</p>

<p>We met some new people. 2 people grew up in the DC area, 1 lives there half the year (all agreed it sucks!). We learned that Molly Moon herself, of <a href="http://www.mollymoonicecream.com/ice-cream-shops">Molly Moon</a> ice cream, lives on the next block. And while Gay was picking up the chocolate from the corporate office of <a href="http://www.franschocolates.com/store/home.php?xid=1ef6fecd8fb7a4bf75f32320e0469053">Fran’s Chocolate</a> this afternoon, learned some things while talking to Dylan, Fran’s son who she went to college with and who works at the company: Fran lives on the next block too so Dylan grew up in our neighborhood, her husband worked with the previous owner of this house many years ago, and Dylan remembered going trick-or-treating at our house as a kid. Small world.</p>
