    <p>It was one of the most exciting first weeks of a Tour, but once Froome and Contador crashed out and abandoned, the winner was all but set and it became a race for 2nd place. And Americans Talansky and (Tacoma, WA native) Van Garderen had tough races, although finishing 5th is still good. But I’m sad to see it over nevertheless. </p>

<p>Nibali was a great winner, attacking even with a commanding lead already. It was an impressive victory and Nibali is one of only 6 people to win all 3 Grand Tours. Hard to believe his coach <a href="http://www.cyclingquotes.com/news/vinokourov_criticizes_nibali_in_internal_letter/">wrote him a letter this year</a> telling him he’s disappointed.</p>
