              <p>Eva is 1 month old today. She’s a good baby so far, she cries even less than Hudson did, I think (and much much less than Havana did!). She’s growing well and has gained almost a pound and a half.</p>

              <p>When we got home yesterday, Hudson’s eye was pink and infected and he had a fever. It looked like <a href="https://health.google.com/health/ref/Conjunctivitis">pink eye</a>. The pediatrician wanted to get a look at him to see if he had an ear infection or even strep throat, so we scheduled an appointment for today so I decided to go with and do more work at the house. This morning, he looked much better but we went anyway. He’s fine, no ear infection or strep throat.</p>

<p>Gay dropped me off at the house and I got a couple hours to hang out and put up some blocking in the basement. Hudson got to spend some time with us without Havana around too. He’s almost a different person when Havana’s not taking all the attention.</p>

              <p>Eva had a doctor’s visit and Gay was going to meet Nancy and My to pick out the actual slabs (as opposed to getting a random one based on samples) of marble and granite. So I decided to go in with her and work at the house again.</p>

<p>Today, I pulled some lathe &amp; plaster off the south wall of our offices so I could run some cable into our offices. After that, I tidied up cable I had run in the attic crawl space and in the master bedroom. Then I got some training with the nail gun and put some blocking in the sauna wall, preparing for the sauna installation.</p>

<p>The drywall guys started preparing the studs for the drywall. They make the studs square and flat because wood bends soon after it’s used. They do this with planers and shims to make sure all the planes of the walls are flat. This makes the finished walls flat and even. I doubt any house I’ve lived in had this done!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the other Schuhart/Dow guys were starting the framing in the garage. That’s the last of the framing and rough carpentry work.</p>

<p>The plumbing and HVAC have passed inspection. The electrical work is behind schedule and it doesn’t look like it will be done for a few more days. The drywall can’t go up until that is done and passes inspection. My low
voltage work is done and shouldn’t be a problem for the electrical inspection, but you never know how strict the inspector will be.</p>

              <p>We visited Twisted Metalworks and then <a href="http://www.12thavenueiron.com/">12th Avenue Iron</a> to meet the metal fabricators for the metal work in the house. 12th Avenue Iron has a very cool shop (with an office designed by Tom Kundig) and is in our neighborhood on Capitol Hill.</p>

<p>One or both of them will do steel shelving in the kitchen and family room, steel cladding on the office sliding wall and pantry barn door, steel plating on the pantry shelving, steel cladding on the basement stair risers and the steel wall and handrail for the basement stairs, steel plating on our bathroom vanity cabinetry and around the doorways, door pulls on the barn doors and, possibly, a wall-mounted bottle opener in the butler’s pantry.</p>

              <p>We met with the other Troy, from <a href="http://www.legacyrenovation.com/">Legacy Renovation</a> who is repairing the existing windows, and Katie and Mark, from Schuchart/Dow, to talk about the windows and screens.  They had put screens in two windows to show us what they look like and we hated them – ugly and permanent –  so we wanted to talk about custom screens that would look better and be removed when not needed. He described how they’d work and look and they should be much better, so he’s going to work up an estimate for them. They’ll be more expensive, of course, but we only need them on the bedroom windows. We also talked about his shop drawing for the new window in the kitchen – looks good – and hardware on the windows.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Then we talked to Tim from the HVAC people to talk about locations for thermostats. There will be 7 (!) thermostats in the house: one for the radiators throughout the house, one for the kitchen + family room in-floor radiant heat, one for the basement in-floor radiant heat, two for  the radiators in our offices, one for the radiant floor in the master bedroom and one for the 2nd kids’ bathroom radiant floor. Some thermostats have remote sensors now, so we can locate the thermostat where it’s hidden (there’s no such thing as a good-looking thermostat) and have a remote sensor installed almost invisibly in the walls. So, except in our offices where there is no place to hide them, all the thermostats will be hidden from view.</p>

<p>Then we walked around with Bill, the electrician, to double-check switch and outlet locations. We didn’t make many significant changes except we decided to control the two walkways to the bathroom from the master bedroom independently. We also agreed with the lighting guy about adding two can lights in the dining room to light the table better.</p>

<p>The roofing guys were finishing up the skylights and this was the first time we got to see the attic with all the skylights in. Even on the cloudy day the attic felt almost like it had no roof on it at all. I’m really happy with the amount of light in there now, but now I’m concerned that it will get <em>too much</em> light and be too hot in the summer. I hope we can get good airflow from the ceiling fans and open windows up there. I also have to admit that I was wrong and Tom Kundig was right about how the cross-ties there will look – the light from above really shows off the grain in the wood and they look a lot more interesting than I was expecting. They should stand out even more once the pitched roof is drywalled and painted.</p>
