          <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIU0Jwu54w">Colbert Report</a>: A congressman who sponsored a bill to display the 10 Commandments in a judicial building can’t name a better building than a courtroom to display them (a Church is a <em>worse</em> place to display them?), but more importantly, wants our justice system to follow 10 rules that he doesn’t even know. If he hasn’t even read the 10 Commandments, can we believe he’s read the bill he is trying to push through Congress?</p>

<p>Congress just <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003059851_watch14.html">secretly voted</a> to give themselves another pay-raise, something they’ve done ever year for 7 years, while <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/21/AR2006062101069.html?nav=rss_politics">voting against a minimum-wage increase</a>, something they’ve done every year for 9 years. If we’re paying their salaries, is it too much to ask that they actually spend some time reading the things they endorse?</p>

<p>Argh! I hate politics. Why do I even bother to find something positive  in the political news?</p>

          <p>Ben was appropriately contrite after <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=3190">his idiotic accident</a>:</p>

<blockquote>"I recognize that I have a responsibility to safeguard my health in the off-season so I can continue to lead our team effectively. I never meant any harm to others nor to break any laws. I was confident in my ability to ride a motorcycle and simply believed such an accident would not happen to me.

"If I ever ride again, it certainly will be with a helmet."</blockquote>

<p>He didn’t intend to break any laws, yeah, I guess, although the law was pretty clear that he was not licensed to ride without a helmet. <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06171/699570-66.stm">Cowher had wise words</a> on Ben’s stupidity:</p>

<blockquote>"Sometimes with the lessons of life, you have to get knocked down before you get back up," he said.</blockquote>

<p>But I won’t be eating any <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/138858">Roethlis-burgers</a> until I’m sure he’s ready to win another Super Bowl.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Wow, end of an era. <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-6084396.html?tag=nl.e589">Bill Gates is stepping down from full-time Microsoft role</a> to transition to full-time work at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. Good for him, it’s gotta be tough to leave the company you founded. But I can’t believe this is because Microsoft needs executive changes – Gates wasn’t the problem. Ballmer and Allchin are the problem. They booted Allchin last year, which was smart. But Ballmer’s gotta be on his way out the door too. Ballmer is a sales guy who’d be just as happy back at Procter &amp; Gamble selling detergent. He’s the one that turned the company from a software company to a company that makes software. That’s when Microsoft lost its edge.</p>

          <p>My new cell phone arrived today, a <a href="http://www.europe.nokia.com/nokia/0,,81718,00.html">Nokia E61</a>, aka, the “Nokiaberry”. Now I’m in cool club of people who use smartphones and can retire my dumbphone. This thing is long and coming to the US so there’s very few reviews of it online, so maybe I’ll write one here after I’ve used it a couple weeks.
