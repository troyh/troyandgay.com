          <p>Ben was appropriately contrite after <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=3190">his idiotic accident</a>:</p>

<blockquote>"I recognize that I have a responsibility to safeguard my health in the off-season so I can continue to lead our team effectively. I never meant any harm to others nor to break any laws. I was confident in my ability to ride a motorcycle and simply believed such an accident would not happen to me.

"If I ever ride again, it certainly will be with a helmet."</blockquote>

<p>He didn’t intend to break any laws, yeah, I guess, although the law was pretty clear that he was not licensed to ride without a helmet. <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06171/699570-66.stm">Cowher had wise words</a> on Ben’s stupidity:</p>

<blockquote>"Sometimes with the lessons of life, you have to get knocked down before you get back up," he said.</blockquote>

<p>But I won’t be eating any <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/138858">Roethlis-burgers</a> until I’m sure he’s ready to win another Super Bowl.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Wow, end of an era. <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-6084396.html?tag=nl.e589">Bill Gates is stepping down from full-time Microsoft role</a> to transition to full-time work at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. Good for him, it’s gotta be tough to leave the company you founded. But I can’t believe this is because Microsoft needs executive changes – Gates wasn’t the problem. Ballmer and Allchin are the problem. They booted Allchin last year, which was smart. But Ballmer’s gotta be on his way out the door too. Ballmer is a sales guy who’d be just as happy back at Procter &amp; Gamble selling detergent. He’s the one that turned the company from a software company to a company that makes software. That’s when Microsoft lost its edge.</p>

          <p>My new cell phone arrived today, a <a href="http://www.europe.nokia.com/nokia/0,,81718,00.html">Nokia E61</a>, aka, the “Nokiaberry”. Now I’m in cool club of people who use smartphones and can retire my dumbphone. This thing is long and coming to the US so there’s very few reviews of it online, so maybe I’ll write one here after I’ve used it a couple weeks.

          <p><a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06163/697655-100.stm">Roethlisberger in surgery after serious motorcycle crash</a>. I hope he recovers and it looks like he will, but crikey, what a lucky idiot. He’s 24 and on his way to be one of the NFL’s greatest players in history and he risks it so he can ride his motorcycle without a helmet. NFL Radio played a year-old interview with Ben about riding without a helmet where the reporter said “But you wouldn’t play football without a helmet” and he replied that he wears a helmet in the NFL because the NFL says you have to wear a helmet. So would he not wear a helmet if the NFL said he didn’t have to? He’s certainly not the brightest guy in the world.</p>
