          <p>After an almost completely disastrous day in the time trial on Saturday, all the Americans except for Floyd Landis put themselves out of contention. And Bobby Julich put himself in the hospital after crashing in a roundabout and breaking his wrist. Floyd Landis finished a minute, and second place, behind the winner and Hincapie stayed within a minute or so of him. But Leipheimer lost over 5 minutes!</p>

<p>In the second day of the mountains yesterday, Floyd Landis finished third and took the yellow jersey by 8 seconds after dropping all the strongest rivals, including Kloden. Surprisingly, Leipheimer stayed with him and is now the second highest-placed American, but still 5 minutes back. It looks like Landis, Menchov and Cadel Evans are the most likely podium places, but it’s still a long way to Paris.</p>

<p>The most enjoyable part of the day yesterday was watching Iban Mayo, probably the least amicable person in cycling today, crack and fall way off the back on the <em>first</em> climb of the day. Adding to the fun, he got angry at the cameraman following him on the motorcycle videotaping his pathetic performance. The cameraman was following the team leader who is supposed to be a contender for the race win and he’s the caboose on the train. That’s big news Iban; if you don’t want a cameraman following you, don’t ride in the Tour de France. He later abandoned the race altogether. This guy used to be a top rider, what happened to him?!</p>

          <p>I don’t get the Social Networking buzz.</p>

<p>My Space is “officially” <a href="http://www.paidcontent.org/yahoo-myspace-ranking-spat">more signficant than Yahoo</a>.  There is <em>competition</em> in the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/07/11/dogster-has-competition/">social network space for DOGS</a>. Now add <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/06/11/cnet-veterans-launch-boompa-myspace-for-cars/">network for my hoopty</a>, one for sports that no one watches, followed closely by <a href="http://www.paidcontent.org/social-network-for-political-networkers-hotsoup">a social network for social networkers</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/07/12/kickapps-social-networking-software-launches/">software so any once can roll your own social network site</a>.</p>

<p>I don’t deny that My Space is a great way for the kids to find dates and efficiently keep the peer pressure machine churning away.  And, sure, hockey/car/dog fans deserve a place to swap stories, but aren’t we really just taking about making acquaintances, something that happens all the time in the real world without millions in funding, patents, or advertising involved.</p>

<p>Of course, there will be some people who get totally into one or another of these sites and make a permanent home, but if you don’t stay active, the masses pass you by, and you simply can’t stay active in many.  (If only I had a dollar for every abandoned tribe, friendster, my space, msn spaces, livejournal, blogger profile….)  They are only so many minutes in the day, and only so many times you want to retype the same basic stuff.  Young people have time to maintain different identities and levels of friendship, but for the rest of us, one identity is hard enough.</p>

<p>As for the brilliant software concept:  I just don’t see it as anything special (certainly not worth funding or buying).  This is still basically e-mail with photos, just not in the convenience of my central inbox or using my handy address book.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/1234000380073791">Mark Cuban captures it well in his post on how boring the internet really is:</a></p>

<blockquote>_And come on now, blogging ? If GeoCities had created a script to add dated journal entries and gotten rid of those ugly floating ads that made everyone hate it, would this be posted on GeoBlogMaverick ? And my goodness, if GeoCities had the foresite to add the Myspace concept of friends instead of rings and host people’s media files, would we call it a revolutionary social network ? Or just a webpage and file hosting service  ? Which is exactly what Myspace and other social networks are._</blockquote>

          <p>The top European contender for the win, Valverde, crashed yesterday in Stage 3 and broke a collarbone and is out of the race. American Fred Rodriguez crashed too and has abandoned with the same injury.
This leaves Iban Mayo as the top contender against the Americans Hincapie, Landis and Leipheimer. It’s a long race yet, but I’m starting to imagine Americans taking 1, 2 and 3!</p>

          <p>The day before the Tour de France starts, the <a href="http://velonews.com/tour2006/news/articles/10176.0.html">top contenders were ejected from the race</a> after “overwhelming evidence” showed that they were doping. Three of the top 5 from last year are included. The most shocking ejections are Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso, one of which was practically guaranteed to win this year. Basso and Ullrich deny the charges, which is probably expected.
And poor Vinokourov… he left T-Mobile last year because Jan was the captain and now his new team is all but gone from the race and he wasn’t even implicated. If only had had stayed on T-Mobile, he’d be the team leader on probably the winner. He can’t possibly win now. <strong>Update:</strong> He can’t win now because <a href="http://eurosport.com/cycling/tour-de-france/2006/sport_sto917542.shtml">his whole team has been pulled</a>.
On the bright side, this is going to make it much easier on Americans Hincapie, Leipheimer and Landis to get on the podium, if not win it!
It’s great that the UCI is hard-line about anti-doping. If only other sports were as strict.</p>
