              <p>I’ve written “most of this already”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2007/11/05/11-months-in-review/, but in the interest of having a New Year’s Day post…</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The year started off like every previous year, just working, working, working, lots of ideas and plans for the company and looking forward to another great year for the site. Gay was five months pregnant and I was getting anxious and nervous about being a dad and trying to figure out how I’d be able to concentrate on work yet give her enough attention. It turns out that was easier than I thought. More on that below.</p>

<p>We finished having the house painted, which took two months, and we were getting the nursery and her bathroom ready. Gay was buying all the furniture, baby carriage, car seat and clothes – the UPS guy was the only person outside of the family and circle of friends who knew a baby was coming. We knew it was a girl and we were picking names. Gay was spending less time working at this point and I was trying to keep busy working because I knew I’d be working a lot less in the weeks after she was born. I had no idea that it’d be months of hardly working! It turns out there’s a reason people get maternity/paternity leave, I always thought they were slackers.</p>

<p>In April, Havana Elle was born, happy and healthy. Seeing your baby born is one of life’s great experiences. People who had babies told me that and I always nodded politely and said “Yeah, I can imagine”, but I assumed it was just one of those platitudes parents have to say. She looked like an alien with a huge head and eyes and black hair and crying. I wasn’t looking forward to it and didn’t know how I’d handle it, but I’m glad I was there and I’ll never forget the instant I first saw her. It helps that they do a good job keeping the blood and gore out of sight and they clean ‘em up really quick. Since we knew she was a girl, I could appreciate the experience without having to ask “Is it a boy or a girl?”, it’s enough to figure out if she has the proper number of arms, legs, fingers, toes, eyes, ears, etc. (She does).</p>

<p>Right after she was born, I took up the shortest-lived hobby I’ve ever had: cigar-smoking. I got 10 Cuban cigars, Cohibas no less, to give out to people because of tradition, but mostly because her name was Havana. Five were Robustos and the other five were Siglo IIs. I didn’t know anything about them, I just picked them out of a line-up on a web site. They weren’t cheap, the 10 of them cost me $350! But it was money well-spent, I loved those cigars! I ended up smoking four of them and only gave out six. I don’t smoke and have never liked smoking, but those cigars were amazing. I bought myself a humidor, a cutter, a nice lighter and, not wanting to make a habit of skirting the US embargo on Cuba, I ordered a dozen Dominican cigars of various brands. I hated them all. But I didn’t give up that easily. I splurged again and got a five-pack of “Davidoff’s”:http://www.davidoff.com/, which are supposed to be some of the best outside of Cuba. I didn’t like those either. At this point, I’m an even bigger supporter of “ending the Cuban embargo”:http://www.portfolio.com/views/columns/washington/2007/11/19/Cuba-Embargo-Reasons-to-End, but until it’s over, I’ll have to confine my cigar habit to trips outside the US. And my humidor will be empty.</p>

<p>Gay’s mom, dad and aunts visited for a few days a few weeks later and I was an old pro at taking care of her. She cried and it didn’t bother me at all and the first few weeks in I was a way better dad than Gay was a mom, if I do say so myself. Then it all changed. The cry-eat-cry-sleep-cry hourly cycle was wearing thin. I was sick of waking up at all hours to try to get her to go to sleep or change a diaper in the dark. Havana and I were bitter enemies for many months. Now it’s safe to say that Gay is the better parent and I’m just the guy who helps out here and there when the nanny isn’t around.</p>

<p>In May we agreed to sell our company and by July, the deal was closed and I was ready to get back to work on the site that had been kept alive by our hard-working employees. Gay went to Spokane for her 20-year high school reunion the next week with Havana and I enjoyed a couple days of peace and quiet and alone time, something I get very little of these days. We went to Walla Walla for a weekend for Gay’s 15-year college reunion, 16 years after graduating (2007 minus 1991 equals 15 if you go to a liberal arts school), and we visited a few wineries.</p>

<p>Work was boring, our responsibilities were almost completely taken away and we were kept at arm’s length from the site. We could have worked for years doing nothing and earning fat salaries and enjoying good healthcare but we were both miserable. After eight years of loving your job and being excited to get out of bed in the morning, even a few weeks of boredom in your job and wondering why you should get out of bed in the morning, or worse, having to get out of bed to attend a conference call, was unacceptable. Our days were numbered.</p>

<p>In September we went to Hawaii for a week. Neither of us had been there before. It was relaxing, all we did was hang out by the pool with Havana and enjoyed the weather. Hawaii is like the American version of Bali to me, but the type of American that is supposed to be an improvement on the real thing and never is. But it was easy and sedate, which is what we wanted. The day after we got back, we quit our jobs.</p>

<p>Gay’s mom visited again for a week or so in early November and she acted as a fill-in nanny while our nanny was in Brazil. My parents made it out for Thanksgiving and to see Havana for the first time in person, and they also acted as nannies. Until then, regular Skype video calls were a great replacement for face-to-face contact – they could see her grow from the beginning thanks to Skype. As Ali G says: “Tekmology!”</p>

<p>Havana “can almost crawl”:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJWxd6UuclU, but if you hold her hands she can walk anywhere she pleases. She seems to love the freedom of being partially mobile. She doesn’t talk yet either, just makes the same noises like “Baaa Baaa” and “Maaa Maaa” (which I assume is “Mama”), she grunts a lot when she’s trying to crawl and she still says “Gack!” a lot. She’s even developed “an odd laugh”:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LacScf6HxQ. She likes to reach out and pet the dogs. Ouzo puts up with it but Illy gives us a look like “Can you make her stop? I’m sleeping here.” She’s been eating solid foods for a while now, even adult food at times, and can hold her own bottle of milk and feed herself. She loves Cheerios and bananas for breakfast, peas, apples, pasta, baby food or really anything for other meals, she doesn’t appear to be picky. It’s all finger-food now, she’s not yet figured out the spoon herself. She sleeps through the night usually too, which is a boon to Gay, but I learned to sleep through the night (and her cries) many months ago.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Maker’s Mark has long been our choice of bourbon, but it was time to see if that was still true. We did a blind taste test of four top-shelf bourbons: Booker’s, <a href="http://makersmark.com/AgeCheck.aspx?redir=%2fDefault.aspx">Maker’s Mark</a>, Basil Hayden’s and <a href="http://www.knobcreek.com/lpa">Knob Creek</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2386/2113452120_200790268a.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Booker’s and Basil Hayden’s are made by relatives of the famous and very successful bourbon-maker Jim Beam. Another bourbon that we didn’t test is Baker’s, also a relative of Jim Beam (they like names that start with B, apparently). Knob Creek is also in the Jim Beam family of bourbons, made by the Jim Beam company. Maker’s Mark’s history has nothing at all to do with Jim Beam, but started by William Samuels in 1959 and later credited with sparking the revitalization of bourbon. Today, all of these bourbons are owned by Fortune Brands, which owns many companies including Titleist, Moen (the faucet-maker), several wineries and both low- and high-quality bourbons, including Jim Beam.</p>

<p>Aging of bourbon is usually cited as an indicator of quality. These four bourbons are all aged different number of years. Basil Hayden’s is aged 8 years, Knob Creek is aged 9 years and the other two are aged a varying number of years, apparently decided by the taste panels at the distilleries. Booker’s claims their bourbons are aged “6 to 8 years” and Maker’s Mark doesn’t make any claims at all about the aging, just that “it’s sold when it’s ready”. Our bottle of Booker’s is stamped as having been aged 6 years and 3 months. Given that temperature has the biggest impact on the aging process, Booker’s and Maker’s Mark seem to have the better model than the fixed aging time of the other two. But will we notice the difference in our taste test?</p>

<p>The alcohol percentage is also different in each bourbon. Bourbon is typically 40% alcohol (80 proof) and Basil Hayden’s meets that exactly. Maker’s Mark is slightly more at 45% (90 proof). Knob Creek is higher still at 50% (100 proof). But Booker’s is off the charts at 63% (126 proof)! Will that be noticeable in our taste tests?</p>

<p>As these are all top-shelf (and small batch) bourbons, they aren’t inexpensive but they don’t vary much. Knob Creek, Basil Hayden’s and Maker’s Mark are all about $32-$35 for 750ml. Booker’s is $54. Will price make a difference in our test? Booker’s also comes in a stupid wooden box. I guess they need to justify its higher price somehow and I imagine there’s some nut who collects the things as badges of honor or something, but they should do away with it and put it in a nicer bottle. The bottle is a wine bottle with black wax holding the corked cap and a ribbon on the bottle. The only worse packaging is Basil Hayden’s, which is also in a wine bottle with an identical corked cap but it has a paper label draped around its neck and held in place with a balsa wood strap with a metal “bh” bolted to it. It looks like a monk wearing a frock and belt with a belt buckle. Knob Creek gets marks for an interesting bottle shape, inspired by an old flask and the label resembles a newspaper wrapped around it, which is how bourbon used to be packed many years ago. It also uses a corked top and wax holds it on. But Maker’s Mark is the master of packaging: a uniquely shaped square-base bottle with the trademark dripping red wax. The label is like parchment paper with a very classic logo. The red wax and label were the ideas of founder Bill Samuels’ wife. And best of all, it has a screw-top which keeps the contents preserved better than a loose-fitting cork.</p>

<p>We did a blind taste test, meaning we didn’t know which bourbons were which – they were in identical glasses marked on the bottom and randomly arranged. We evaluated color, smell and, of course, taste. This is how I evaluate beer, so I figure I’d test bourbons the same way. We rated each as best (4 points), second-best (3 points), third-best (2 points) and worst (1 point) and then unveiled each one to see the winner.</p>

<p>Color: We scored exactly the same in this test. Booker’s was easily the most pleasant color, a very dark brown, which we find appealing, so it got 4 points. Maker’s Mark had the next best color which I thought was very close to Knob Creek, Gay thought they were less close in color. We both agreed that Basil Hayden’s very pale color was not at all appealing. Booker’s is the only bourbon in this group that is “uncut and unfiltered”, which I assume is why it has a richer color.</p>

<p>Smell: Again, we scored identically here. And again, Booker’s won with the best “nose”, spicy but not a strong alcohol smell which is surprising given it’s 50%-higher level of alcohol. Maker’s Mark scored second with a full “oak-y” aroma. Knob Creek and Basil Hayden’s were very similar to me and both smelled terrible, like nail polish, i.e., a very strong alcohol smell, which I don’t like at all (in beer or wine either).</p>

<p>Taste: This is what really matters and this is where we differed in our scoring. For me, Maker’s Mark was the winner. Booker’s was second simply because it’s high alcohol level really showed in its taste, it really gave you a kick while Maker’s Mark had a pleasantly smooth, but sweet and spicy taste all the way through. Booker’s had a slightly better after-taste to me, but the initial whollop you get was just too much. Knob Creek was a distant 3rd, drinkable but lacking a robust flavor. Basil Hayden’s was undrinkable to me. For Gay, surprise, surprise, Knob Creek was her favorite followed by, yikes, Basil Hayden’s due to a “grassy” taste (she loves that in white wines too, I hate it). Booker’s was her third favorite but close to Basil Hayden’s and Maker’s Mark finished dead last!</p>

<p>In my opinion, there’s three “proper” ways to drink bourbon: straight, on-the-rocks or with water and in a Manhattan. This only tested one: straight. We never drink it straight, however, so next we need to test these on the rocks and in a Manhattan. But this was too much for one night, so we’ll have to do it another night.</p>

<p>I did have Booker’s on the rocks to see if the alcohol hit was lessened and it was. On the rocks, Booker’s is probably better to me than Maker’s Mark, but again, the high alcohol content keeps it from being an “everyday” bourbon – just 2/3 of drink with Booker’s and I’ve hit my one bourbon max (unless I want to feel terrible the next day). Maker’s Mark will remain my all-around favorite.</p>

<p>We’ll have to keep a bottle of Knob Creek around for Gay, however. So she can stay away from my Maker’s Mark from now on.</p>

<p>To answer our questions, do age and price affect our evaluations? The most expensive bourbon scored highest overall, but only second- and third-highest in taste. The worst performer, Basil Hayden’s is clearly over-priced. Maker’s Mark and Knob Creek appear to be competitively-priced given that they were our favorites and are priced very similarly. Age is harder to gauge because we don’t know how long my taste winner, Maker’s Mark, is aged. But clearly Basil Hayden’s and Knob Creek’s longer aging compared to Booker’s is of no help for my tastes, which must match the tastes of the taste panels at Maker’s Mark and Booker’s. Gay’s taste-winner is Knob Creek, which is aged the longest (9 years) and her second-favorite is aged the second-longest (8 years), so a longer aging seem to matter to Gay’s tastes.</p>

<p>Stay-tuned, soon we’ll repeat this test in Manhattans and on-the-rocks.</p>

              <p>A year since the big outage last year, the generator is finally installed and connected. Today Suburban Propane finished the hook-up to the 250 gallon tank we had installed last week. The electrician did the final electrical hook-up today. We tested the system by cutting power from the utility, 7 seconds later the generator started up and about 15 seconds after that the transfer switch switched the house’s power to the generator.</p>

<p>It’s even bearable volume-wise. Here’s how it sounds up-close and from about 40 feet away under heavy load (the furnace running in the house). At normal load, it’s even quieter.</p>

<p>The electricians had to re-wire the existing panels to consolidate the core stuff into one panel that would be powered by the generator:</p>

<p>Now that we have a generator, our neighbors should thank us, we’ve probably guaranteed that we’ll have no power outages in the area.</p>
