          <p><img src="http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z172/bruinbirdman/john-mccain.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>On the worst day in the stock market since 9/11, McCain announces his idea for solving our economic problems. He explains the cause:</p>

<p>bq. the old-boy network and the corruption in Washington is directly involved and one of the causes of this financial crisis that we’re in today.</p>

<p>I wonder if McCain has forgotten that he was part of that “old-boy network and corruption in Washington” for the last 26 years. I know he hopes we all forgot.</p>

<p>So his solution is to create a “a high-level commission”:http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/16/america/NA-POL-US-Elections.php to investigate similar to the “9/11 commission”:http://www.9-11commission.gov/. We’ll ignore the fact that the Bush administration ignored all the recommendations of the 9/11 commission report, but McCain thinks bureaucrats will solve the problems that, he believes, bureaucrats created.</p>

<p>He is correct that bureaucrats created the problem. Republicans and McCain hate regulation and the housing and banking crisis we’re experiencing was caused by the de-regulation that the Republicans have wanted for years and got in the mid-1990s. “McCain supported the de-regulation”:http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=s1999-105 that caused it! In fact, <strong>38 of the 39 Democrats in Congress voted against it and all 44 Republicans voted for it</strong>. This was a problem clearly created by Republicans, as McCain correctly pointed out.</p>

<p>Now, McCain’s own economic advisor has a solution:</p>

<p>bq. a McCain economics and policy adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said any plan should include regulation of all sorts of financial institutions, consumer protections, improved corporate governance and “systems stability” programs.</p>

<p>In other words, we just need to undo McCain’s mistake. Yet McCain  thinks we need a commission to spend several years thinking about it. Republicans have no understanding of economics beyond cutting taxes.</p>

        <article>
          <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2851568196/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3098/2851568196_587329d7d1.jpg" alt="IMG_6779.JPG" /></a></p>

<p>We adopted Ouzo in 2001 from a kennel. We had just bought our house on Vashon Island with a yard big enough for two dogs, so we decided to get a friend for Illy. We found Ouzo on “PetFinder”:http://petfinder.com/ and thought he was very cute. So we drove to the kennel to get him.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>His name was “Max” but we changed it to “Ouzo”. Ouzo is a Greek liquor that tastes like black licorice. And he’s a “licker”. ;) But really, it just sounded like an energetic name for an energetic dog and Illy being named after a coffee brand, we continued the favorite beverage theme.</p>

<p>He had been taken away from his owners by the ASPCA after numerous reports from neighbors that he was left outside chained to a pole 24x7, through cold and rain. Because he had such lousy parents, he was wild. He was so out of control that no one wanted him so he sat in the kennel for months. When we went to look at him he was barking and leaping five feet in the air to look over the wall at his neighbor dogs. This scared another woman at the kennel who was also looking for a dog so much she refused to even walk in front of his cage. I don’t know why we weren’t intimidated. Over-confidence, I guess. As we were leaving the kennel personnel told us they were glad we took him because they would be forced to put him to sleep soon.</p>

<p>This was days before we moved to Vashon, in 2001. While we were packing up the truck we tied Ouzo in the backyard with his leash. He chewed through his leash and took off, running around the neighborhood. We drove around the neighborhood for an hour or so before finding him and somehow got him in the car.</p>

<p>In the new house he was a nightmare. He was two years old and still wasn’t housebroken. I was cleaning up after him a couple times a day. We must’ve kept Nature’s Miracle in business singlehandedly during that time.</p>

<p>One night while barbecuing two steaks outside, I went into the kitchen, returned seconds later and found one of the steaks and Ouzo missing. My anger distracted me from the realization that he somehow stood up and grabbed a steak off a hot grill without burning himself. I should have known he was a damn smart dog, but when he came back after his steak dinner, I took his collar off, told him I didn’t want him anymore and demanded that he “Go!”. He just stared at me and wouldn’t leave. I think he knew what taking his collar off meant. Every time we took his collar off for a bath, he looked at us, brushed against our legs like a cat and would poke his nose at his collar as if he wanted to wear it.</p>

<p>Eventually, we came to the conclusion that we either get rid of him or take him to obedience school. Fortunately, we chose obedience school. I think obedience school was better for me than for him. After two weeks, he was house-broken, he didn’t jump on people, he stopped taking food off tables and grills and he could touch his nose to a coffee cup on cue. And I learned patience.</p>

<p>At graduation, Ouzo was the <em>only</em> dog to even attempt a final exam. And he did it perfectly: he sat, layed down and rolled-over on demand. I was as proud of him as I’ve ever been of anything.</p>

<p>Ever since, Ouzo was the dog I never had. He would play fetch for hours.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2851564082/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3186/2851564082_44253d585d.jpg" alt="IMG_0823" /></a></p>

<p>He loved riding in the car with his head out the window, something I thought all dogs loved, but Illy disproves that theory. He was so smart he knew how I opened his car window; he’d lightly bump my left shoulder with his nose and stare at the button near my left hand to tell me to open his window.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2850731531/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3263/2850731531_718ef70e38.jpg" alt="IMG_0952" /></a></p>

<p>He loved to swim.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2850731645/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3031/2850731645_9936469ae5.jpg" alt="IMG_0995" /></a></p>

<p>He was the most polite dog I’ve ever seen, he’d take food from your hand gently (Illy will take your fingers off), always deferring to his big sister Illy, waited patiently for his dinner and after-dinner treat and always got out of your way without being asked. He even went to the bathroom in the woods, never in the grass. And he loved giving kisses to any nearby face.</p>

<p>[flickr video=2564394821 secret=b3f2defc82 w=400 h=300]</p>

<p>Every morning Ouzo would jump up and excitedly run to the door as soon as he heard the sound of coffee being poured into a cup. He knew it was time to go outside to play fetch while we had our morning coffee. He’d make sure we took the <a href="http://www.caninehardware.com/products/chuckitultra/chuckitultra.html">Chuckit!</a> and that it had a tennis ball in it before he’d let us walk through the door and he’d play rain or shine (fewer throws during rain). He disguised his harmlessness by scaring anyone who came to the house with his protective bark, but he was terrified of thunder and needed to be comforted through thunderstorms (and the Fourth of July). He slept in his favorite chair every night and after Havana was born, outside her door. So we moved his chair outside her door. Havana’s first word was “dog” and it was the first thing she said every morning as she pointed to Ouzo who always watched us take her out of her crib.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago, on the day Hudson was born, “we found out”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/26/scary-news-about-ouzo/ that he had a tumor on his heart and would not live much longer. We “tried chemotherapy”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/28/chemo-for-ouzo/, “hoped for an improvement”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/29/ouzo-at-home/, and had his chest cavity “drained of fluid again”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/09/06/ouzo-at-the-vet-again/ to help his breathing. Wednesday night he was having difficulty breathing again. Because the pressure of the fluid against his lungs and heart, he couldn’t lay down to go to sleep so I slept next to him so he could rest his head on my shoulder so he could get some sleep. I knew we’d either have to drain the fluid again or decide to let him go. Because he was needing to be drained more often, every few days, we decided it would be best to let him go rather than put him through the draining process. We called the Vashon vet. They do a nice thing – they come to your house to perform the euthanasia so the dog can go in a place they’re comfortable.</p>

<p>At only 9, his life was too short. Given that the kennel would have had no choice but to put him to sleep, we feel like we gave him 7 more years. And it was a good 7 years. He loved the yard with plenty of room to run, he knew more neighbors than we did, he ate well and had plenty of toys to quickly destroy, especially if they squeaked (his favorites). The kennel where we found him was the last one he ever stayed in. Every trip we took where we couldn’t bring the dogs, we were lucky enough to have good friends and relatives stay at our house to watch the dogs so they could stay at their own home and stick to their normal routine.</p>

<p>We spent Thursday afternoon in the yard with Ouzo playing fetch, relaxing and feeding him good food to enjoy the last hours with him. The vet arrived at 4pm, anesthetized him and he went to sleep with his tennis ball in his mouth and Gay and I petting him and saying our good-byes.</p>

<p>Goodbye Ouzo. You were a good boy.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Sarah Palin <em>is</em> a bad parent. Todd Palin is a bad parent too. Not because their teenage daughter became pregnant, but because they are continuing to ignore the problem. They may be wonderful people with many talents and have the best of intentions, but their parenting skills are not top-notch. Put aside the Republican Party’s political correctness and holier-than-thou preaching. Teenage pregnancies are a failure of the parent and they’re not good for the country or for society. That’s why the Republican Party has (rightly) for years chastised parents when it happens and (wrongly) talked about how we need a return of morality in the country. Now they want to ignore the problem because it happened to their VP candidate during an election year. That’s the definition of hypocrisy.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>If my daughter gets pregnant as a teenager I hope people call me a bad parent because it’s the truth. My refusal to accept it doesn’t do me, my daughter, my son (or any other kids I may have in the future) any good. My fear of being a bad parent is what will make me work harder to be a better parent. That’s good for me and, more importantly, my kids.</p>

<p>Failure and mistakes are not things to be ignore. They are wonderful learning experiences <em>if</em> they are recognized and dealt with. When I ran my own business, what I consider my first child, I made tons of mistakes. I was a terrible business-owner for many years and my business suffered for it. Some people were polite and pretended that the mistakes weren’t made and they thought they were helping me. But the people that helped me were the people who pointed out my mistakes. The people who criticized me, and many did it with great pleasure, helped me the most! The business was successful <em>because</em> I wasn’t allowed to pretend I didn’t make mistakes. I focused on the mistakes, I figured out what I did wrong and I figured out how I can prevent that mistake from happening again. I wasn’t always successful, some mistakes were repeated, but because I embraced the mistakes and worked on fixing them, my business became more successful. Had I brushed the mistakes and failings under the carpet, as the Republican Party is trying to do with Sarah Palin’s mistakes, my business would have been a failure.</p>

<p>Running a business is difficult. But parenting is even more difficult. So it shouldn’t be a surprise that most people fail at it at one time or another. And sometimes they fail in big ways, like Sarah and Todd Palin have. They’re not evil people. They shouldn’t be banished from society and their kids shouldn’t be taken away from them. But they could improve as parents. People who succeed in life are those that recognize their mistakes and work to correct them so that they don’t repeat them. People who fail in life are people who make the same mistakes over and over. Thanks to Sarah Palin and the Republican Party, the country is not allowed to have a conversation about teenage pregnancy and how best to prevent it in the future. We’re asking for more teenage pregnancies if we let the Republican Party brush this under the rug.</p>

<p>Sarah Palin is an advocate of teaching abstinence before marriage and against teaching sex education. If she were a smart person she’d recognize that teaching abstinence doesn’t work. If she were a good parent, she’d admit that teaching abstinence doesn’t work. Sarah Palin told her daughter to abstain and hoped that’d work. She may like to pretend that her daughter and her boyfriend were practicing abstinence but, oops, didn’t abstain just once. My guess is that they were having sex for months and either Sarah and Todd Palin didn’t know about it or they ignored it. Either way, that’s bad parenting. Her refusal to admit this mistake is why she’s a bad parent.</p>

<p>The Republican Party wouldn’t demand that a pregnant teenager is a private issue or that it is “off limits” to the media if Chelsea Clinton or one of Obama’s kids got pregnant. Hillbillies like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly would be preaching from their ivory towers on the immorality of Democrats. John McCain would be running ads about how your kids will become pregnant if Obama is elected. When it happens to a Republican, not only is it okay (some even call it a “blessed event”) it’s touted as evidence that Sarah Palin is an even better mother and even more Presidential. And the American people eat it up. If only the American people understood that the election is about what’s best for the country, not what’s best for the careers of John McCain and Sarah Palin.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The National Enquirer is <a href="http://www.nationalenquirer.com/_palin_family_shockers_what_sarahs_really_hiding/celebrity/65407">reporting more stories</a> about the Palins as parents. If those turn out to be true, it’s a sad day for American journalism that the Enquirer is the only paper that reports the truth. The Republican Party wants America to embrace Palin’s “biography”, but not necessarily the true biography, the one that is manufactured on The Straight Talk Express.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>By Thursday, Ouzo’s breathing had become very labored. Throughout the night Thursday night/Friday morning he didn’t sleep at all because he could barely lay down comfortably. I spent most of the night trying to get him comfortable enough to sleep. He couldn’t put his head on the ground, presumably because of the fluid in his chest, so I gave him a bunch of pillows to rest his head on. That worked for maybe an hour and he slept a little (and so did I). Friday morning we took him to the vet to have his chest cavity drained of fluid. That took over three hours and they drained more than one liter of fluid.</p>

<p>He’s better today and can move around more easily than he could this week. But he still barely eats and I have to carry him up and down the stairs. And he still has a lot of trouble sitting or laying down. His breathing seems to be less labored, but he still seems to struggle to breathe.</p>

<p>We’ve come to the conclusion that we aren’t going to do another chemo treatment. He doesn’t respond well to chemo – he vomited and had diarrhea all week and was very lethargic. And given that he will need to have fluid drained more frequently, which is rough on him too, we feel like we’re prolonging his life but it’s not a very good quality of life for him. So unless he has a miraculous recovery, we’re going to have to let him go sometime in the next week.</p>

<p>The vet, by the way, has doctors and assistants that are knowledgeable and have good bed-side manners, but the customer service is lousy. We got to the vet by 10am, they took Ouzo almost immediately and told us that they’d call us when he’s ready. The time estimate was an hour. So we went to a mall and then to Starbucks for lunch. An hour-and-a-half later we hadn’t yet heard from them so we called. They said they had <em>just</em> started the draining process. We asked how much longer it’d be and were told that it’d be done “shortly” and they suggested that we come back to the vet and he’d be ready to go by the time we got there. Ten minutes later we arrived back at the vet and, again, they said he’d be ready “shortly”. Another hour-and-a-half later, he was out. I took Ouzo and Hudson out to the car while Gay got the discharge papers and to pay the bill. Twenty minutes later, Gay was still waiting for the discharge papers and the bill! You’d think they were really busy, but they weren’t. They always have about 7 people hanging out behind the desk doing little or nothing. Eventually, Gay just walked out and told them to call her when they want us to pay. The place has “mixed reviews”:http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3723219909 from other people.</p>
