Mrs Palin’s elevation suggests that, far from breaking with Mr Bush, Mr McCain is repeating his mistakes.”</p>

          <p>This is priceless. Republican strategist Mike Murphy and Republican mouthpiece Peggy Noonan say what they really think about Sarah Palin when they think they’re not on camera:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/CrG8w4bb3kg&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1">http://www.youtube.com/v/CrG8w4bb3kg&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1</a></p>

<p>Transcript:</p>

<blockquote>Mike Murphy: ...Because I come from a blue swing state governor world, you know, Angler, Whitman, Tommy Thompson, Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush, and these guys... this is all like, how do you want to pick this race (?)... just run it up. And, it's not gonna work.

Peggy Noonan: It's over.

Mike Murphy: Still, McCain can give a version of Lieberman's speech and do himself some good.

Chuck Todd: The Palin pick is insulting to Kay Bailey Hutchison

Peggy Noonan: I saw Kaye this morning

Mike Murphy:  Yeah she's never gonna feel comfortable about this. They're all bummed out

Chuck Todd: I mean, is she really the most qualified woman?

Peggy Noonan: The most qualified? No. I think the went for this, excuse me, political bullshit, about narratives...

Chuck Todd: Yeah, but what's the narrative?

Peggy Noonan: Every time the Republicans do that, because that's not where they live, and it's not what they're good at, and they blow it.

Mike Murphy: You know what's really the worst thing about it? The greatest of McCain is no cynicism, and this is cynical, and it's gimmicky.</blockquote>

<p>This ticket is creating one of the few litmus tests in politics: if you ever hear someone admit they voted for McCain/Palin, you can safely write them off as a gullible idiot.</p>

          <p>Sarah Palin’s 17-year old unmarried daughter “is pregnant”:http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/01/palin.daughter/index.html?eref=rss_topstories. Classic. In 2006, she was asked about sex ed programs in schools:</p>

<p>bq. Will you support funding for abstinence-until-marriage education instead of for explicit sex-education programs, school-based clinics, and the distribution of contraceptives in schools?
SP: Yes, the explicit sex-ed programs will not find my support.</p>

<p>No wonder her daughter is pregnant. The abstinence-until-marriage education didn’t work for her own daughter because it doesn’t work period.</p>

<p>Refuting the Republican Party’s claim that she’s really smart, when asked about “Under God” in the pledge of allegiance, “she answered”:http://eagleforumalaska.blogspot.com/2006/07/2006-gubernatorial-candidate.html:</p>

<p>bq. Are you offended by the phrase “Under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance? Why or why not?
SP: Not on your life. If it was good enough for the founding fathers, its good enough for me and I’ll fight in defense of our Pledge of Allegiance</p>

<p>Uhhh… a person running for VP didn’t know that the founding fathers didn’t write the Pledge of Allegiance or that the original version did not include “Under God”? Do they have schools in Alaska? Lets ask her how to spell “potato” and see if she’s even dumber than Dan Quayle.</p>

<p>Another question she was asked:</p>

<p>bq. Do you support the Alaska Supreme Court’s ruling that spousal benefits for state employees should be given to same-sex couples? Why or why not?
SP: No, I believe spousal benefits are reserved for married citizens as defined in our constitution.</p>

<p>What a dumbass… marriage is not defined or even mentioned in our Constitution.</p>

<p>And, of course, she lied about not supporting the “Bridge To Nowhere”. While campaigning, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/31/AR2008083102017.html">she fully-supported the project</a>.</p>

<p>Did McCain put <em>any</em> thought into this pick? Come on McCain, do the right thing for the country: kick her off the ticket and pick someone with a brain.</p>

          <p>This is hardly news to people who bothered to look at the last 50 years of stock market history or were alive for the last 20 years to watch the Bushies kill our economy and Clinton revitalize it. Princeton economics professor and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Binder talks about a book that “proves Democrats are clearly better for the economy than Republicans”:http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/08/alan-blinder-is-history-siding-with.html. Republicans like to selfishly vote with their pocketbooks and vote Republican simply to lower their taxes (some are even proud of this idea!) but not only are they hurting themselves, they’re hurting our country.</p>

        <article>
          <p>I try to ignore politics as much as I can because after the 2004 election, I realized that most Americans are so stupid that it was too annoying to follow politics. It’s kinda like following professional wrestling – you can feel your brain turning to mush as you listen to the commentaries. But McCain’s pick for a VP is so absurd I can’t believe it happened. When I saw the headline, I thought it was a hoax that media mistakenly picked up. But it is real and we have to have this national talk about whether it makes sense or not! This is like a serious discussion about whether Homer Simpson would make a good CEO of a nuclear power plant.</p>

<p>McCain actually believes she is qualified to be the leader of the free world. He couldn’t find another Republican that he thinks is better at that job. If there was ever any doubt that he’s really really dumb, he just removed it. Americans love their dummies (and hate their smart people), so he might actually win the election. Because he might actually win, I hope McCain wakes up and she “decides” to back out of the position so he can put someone credible in the VP slot. I commend him for choosing a woman, but there are far smarter and more qualified women in the Republican party than Sarah Palin.</p>

<p>I watched the cable news channels last night to try to understand if there’s anything at all that would make this pick not the biggest mistake in political history. I found plenty of Republican mouthpieces trying hard to make the case for Sarah Palin as the VP, and even the eventual President if McCain is incapacitated, and they did it with a straight face. And I learned more about her “biography”, as the Republicans like to say. Her entire political career consists of joining the PTA, being elected to the city council and then Mayor of a podunk town in Alaska and then Governor for the last 18 months. To put the bulk of her political experience, all 6 years of it, into perspective, she was on the city council and Mayor of a town of “6,715 people”:http://www.cityofwasilla.com/index.aspx?page=49. I live on Vashon Island, which has a population of 12,000, almost twice as big, and our Mayor is a fake job that we vote on at the annual island celebration as a fundraiser ($1 per vote). Vashon Island is so small, many people in Seattle don’t even know it exists, even though it’s right next to Seattle. Sarah Palin was the mayor of a town smaller than Vashon Island and that makes her qualified to be the <em>Vice President of the United States</em>, according to John McCain and his McIdiots.</p>

<p>You’d think they’d stop there and admit that she lacks foreign policy experience but McCain makes up for it. But they don’t. The Republicans are saying that Sarah Palin has a wealth of political and foreign policy experience. Apparently, Steve Doocy, a propaganda tool (and he is a <em>tool</em>) said that because Alaska is near Russia, she has foreign policy experience. What’s the concern with Obama then? Illinois is right next to Canada, so Obama is a foreign policy expert too. Other Republicans said that being in charge of Alaska’s National Guard gives her foreign policy experience. I guess they don’t know the meaning of the word <em>national</em>. You know you can’t trust a Republican when they can’t admit that Sarah Palin is not a great VP pick. Behind the scenes, they have to be shaking their heads at how poor McCain’s judgment is. I’d rather have Dick Cheney be VP!</p>

<p>Incidentally, I remember Steve Doocy from when I lived in the Washington, DC area. He was the guy on the local news who did the “wacky” stories around town like the dog that barks at stop lights, the kid who collects bugs, etc. Now he’s someone on national TV, albeit Fox News, and people listen to what he says and believe it. Steve Doocy is a respected journalist and Sarah Palin is a VP candidate… the end is nigh!</p>
