          <p>The windows went in this morning, and boy, is it foggy today. The windows are <em>huge</em>, they each weigh 400lbs (181kg) and are 8 feet (2.4m) wide. So they had to bring in a forklift to lift them to the second floor.</p>

<p>On the inside, they used suction-cup thingies to maneuver the window.

          <p>The carpet and the vinyl flooring has been pulled up, the drywall and insulation was removed from the exterior wall, the roof was supported with a brace and today the holes for the windows were cut. The spaces for the windows are surprisingly big, it was shocking to walk into the room for the first time.</p>

<p>From the outside:

<p>Tomorrow the windows should go in and the electrician is coming on Monday to do all the electrical work. We still need to pick out the flooring. Right now, we’re planning to go with a dark brown bamboo flooring. Bamboo is extremely durable and eco-friendly since bamboo is essentially a weed, so there’s no shortage of it.</p>

<p>According to this graphic, which colors the state in shades of blue and red based on the percentage of Democrat and Republican votes in each state, shows that the US is less red than the electoral map indicates. That’s encouraging, in fact, the country appears to be very moderate to left-leaning. Very interesting. “This graphic”:http://s-train.kaphmedia.net/archives/blog-misc/2004countymap2.gif, which shows the breakdown at the precinct-level, i.e., all-or-nothing counting the way the electoral college works.</p>
