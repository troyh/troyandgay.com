          <p>The carpet and the vinyl flooring has been pulled up, the drywall and insulation was removed from the exterior wall, the roof was supported with a brace and today the holes for the windows were cut. The spaces for the windows are surprisingly big, it was shocking to walk into the room for the first time.</p>

<p>From the outside:

<p>Tomorrow the windows should go in and the electrician is coming on Monday to do all the electrical work. We still need to pick out the flooring. Right now, we’re planning to go with a dark brown bamboo flooring. Bamboo is extremely durable and eco-friendly since bamboo is essentially a weed, so there’s no shortage of it.</p>

<p>According to this graphic, which colors the state in shades of blue and red based on the percentage of Democrat and Republican votes in each state, shows that the US is less red than the electoral map indicates. That’s encouraging, in fact, the country appears to be very moderate to left-leaning. Very interesting. “This graphic”:http://s-train.kaphmedia.net/archives/blog-misc/2004countymap2.gif, which shows the breakdown at the precinct-level, i.e., all-or-nothing counting the way the electoral college works.</p>

          <p>Bush’s “acceptance speech”:http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/11/20041103-3.html: <em>Reaching these goals will require the broad support of Americans. So today I want to speak to every person who voted for my opponent: To make this nation stronger and better I will need your support, and I will work to earn it. I will do all I can do to deserve your trust. A new term is a new opportunity to reach out to the whole nation. We have one country, one Constitution and one future that binds us. And when we come together and work together, there is no limit to the greatness of America.</em></p>

<p>I hope he’s as successful in uniting the country as he was in dividing it.</p>

          <p>“The US is going even farther right-wing”:http://salon.com/opinion/blumenthal/2004/11/03/second_bush_term/index.html: <em>While Kerry ran on the mainstream American traditions of international cooperation and domestic investment, and transparency and rationality as essential to democratic government, Bush campaigned directly against these very ideas. At his rallies, Bush was introduced as standing for “the right God.” During the closing weeks of the campaign, Bush and Cheney ridiculed internationalism, falsifying Kerry’s statement about a “global test.” They disdained Kerry’s internationalism as effeminate, unpatriotic, a character flaw and elitist. “You can put lipstick on a pig, but it’s still a pig,” Vice President Cheney derided in every speech. They grafted imperial unilateralism onto provincial isolationism. Fear of the rest of the world was to be mastered with contempt for it.</em></p>

<p>Waking up today I feel like the US just turned a corner and is headed down a dark alley. I feel much like I remember feeling on 9/11: the fear and uncertainty of a new world. I do not want to have kids and raise them in a country that rejects logic and rational thought in favor of irrational ideology. I don’t want to raise kids fighting against the US mentality of hatred for the rest of the world. I want my kids to appreciate and respect the world and its different cultures – that’s simply un-American these days and I’m convinced that it’s not going to get better in my lifetime. What we do with our lives will be a question I’ll be trying to answer for the next several months, but I will spend the day today investigating real estate in Europe.</p>

<p>If anyone has any suggestions or advice for living in Europe, please pass it along… the more info the better! :)</p>
