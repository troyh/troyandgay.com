            <p>I love this…. <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=123897">Velvetinenut</a> in Singapore made a recipe for kids paints and painted this on their bathroom wall:

<p>If someone told me years ago that someone on the other side of the world would paint the name of a web site I made on their bathroom wall….. :)</p>

            <p>A business acquaintance suggested that we look at <a href="http://adzaar.com">Adzaar</a> for advertising on our web site. <em>Adzaar!</em> That’s the first time we’ve ever seen someone use the same naming scheme that we did with <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a>. Recipezaar: where the recipes are. Adzaar: where the ads are?</p>

<p>And it turns out that the domain name was registered by MRL Ventures, which is <a href="http://www.davidgalbraith.org/">David Galbraith</a>’s venture company and the founder or <a href="http://moreover.com">Moreover.com</a>.</p>

<p>Meaningless to you, but pretty interesting to me. And they have a great idea…. ads on a web site that come from an ad network have a huge problem: the ads don’t come from the site itself. So ad-blocking software in web browsers can easily block the ads completely simply by noticing the domain name is different from the originating site. But Adzaar does it by giving publishers the code to put on their site so ads come from the publisher itself. Web browsers can’t block such ads because a browser can’t know whether content is an ad or is content.</p>

<p>I’m not a big fan of advertising, but it’s a fact of the internet that lots of great sites can’t survive without them. But it’s a great idea for a business.</p>

            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/jonmegan.jpg" alt="" />Jon and Megan (and Shammy) spent the weekend at our house. They came over on Saturday morning (early!) so Gay and Megan could do a 20-mile run in their marathon-training. We barbecued salmon for dinner with lots of wine. We had bloody marys the next morning and sat outside in this great weather we’re having and had afternoon beers. This was the first weekend we’ve had to relax all year almost, and just in time from spring. We’ve promised ourselves that we’ll work a more sane schedule this year, so I’m looking forward to the most relaxing summer we’ve had in years. :)</p>

This is the best photo I took while in Vancouver. It’s a shot of downtown driving north on the South Granville Bridge. I forgot to bring the camera with us everywhere we went except for this day when we spent the day with our friend, <a href="http://flee.com">Frank</a>, who now lives in Vancouver full-time.</p>

<p>In addition to C, we ate at <a href="http://www.vijs.ca/index_in.htm">Vij’s</a>, of course, for great indian food. This was my favorite meal of the trip. We also ate at <a href="http://www.vanmag.com/0409/U_diner.html">Chambar</a>, a new (~8 months) Belgian restaurant. I’m not a big fan of Belgian beers, but I did have a <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/470/1862/">Leffe</a> (or two) on draught which was very good.</p>

<p>The weather was beautiful the entire time, no rain at all. And we came home to great weather the rest of the week in Seattle.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>For 30 years Washington state has had a bill languishing in committee which would protect gay people from discrimination in the workplace, in getting housing, loans, etc. Yesterday, <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/221211_civilrights22.html">one of my college pals, now our state Minority leader helped defeat the bill</a>.  <a href="http://www1.leg.wa.gov/senate/finkbeiner">Bill</a> was good guy at Whitman, and when he started in state politics a few years ago he was a Democrat (he switched teams about 10 years ago).  Bill even admits “it [discrimination] happens in some occurrences,” but he didn’t take the small step he could have to prevent it.  Bill, what are you saying to your gay friends?</p>

<p>Another of our Whitman colleagues, Mark Putnam, captures the disgust I feel best</p>

<blockquote>...while it is unsurprising to me that politicians who are old and really religious, or perhaps closeted themselves, are anti-gay, it's shocking when someone your age, who you went to college with, is in a position of power and is thwarting legislation in your state that is only trying to get equal protection in employment, housing, etc. for people. </blockquote>

<p>Bill, do you really want to be remembered like the congressmen who voted against the 14th amendment (equal protection based on race), against the 15th amendment (right to vote for blacks) or for the Jim Crow laws?  A few years from now you will….</p>

<p>Our favorite Time magazine writer, <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/authors/sandeepkaushik.html">Sandeep Kaushik</a> did an <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/2005-04-14/city2.html">article about Bill on this issue before the vote</a> in the Stranger, as well as a terrific <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/2005-04-21/feature.html">expose of how Microsoft (typically a good supporter of gay rights for employees) abandoned support for the legislation after a local megachurch pastor threatened a boycott of the company</a>.</p>
