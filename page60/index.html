              <p>Selecting the exterior color has been delayed and we’re getting down to the wire. The stucco will be fog-coated, not painted (painting is bad for stucco), so it takes longer to get the colors matched and the material delivered. We finally got several color samples painted and hurried Nancy and My to come out to see them. They had time this afternoon, so Gay and I wanted to be there at the same time, so we decided to make another visit to the house today.</p>

<p>I also got the chance to put the last pieces on the ladder rack and Gay could take some light fixtures to be repaired and rewired, pick up a few more window hardware pieces at Rejuvenation and a Costco supply trip. For the colors, I had my favorite color but everyone overruled me, which is usually what happens. They quickly picked one color, so no more samples (!) and we can get the ball rolling to order the material to make that color and get the stucco company started in a few weeks.</p>

              <p>We had a meeting scheduled with the interior designers today so we went in early to stop by the house. There hasn’t been a lot of progress since <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/06/10/a-week-at-the-house/">we were there on Friday</a>. We saw some of the floors that were refinished over the weekend and they look great. And the stucco guys finished the patching they had to do where windows were removed and other places where the stucco had to be removed. They did a good job making it look like the old stucco, which they did by literally throwing the aggregate into the cement. Once it’s colored, it should look pretty close to the original. We’re still waiting for 12th Ave Iron to deliver and install the kitchen shelves, which is holding up the kitchen tile, which is holding up painting.</p>

<p>We had a 2pm meeting at NB’s office and I got to see their new and bigger office on a new floor above for the first time that they moved into a few months ago. We went over the remaining issues, making some progress on decisions, and they came up with a good solution to the master bath shower door hardware that we’ve been dealing with. The unresolved issues with interior design are exterior color selection, dining room chandelier, kitchen bar stools, living room coffee table and several rugs, which are hard for me to accept because rugs are expensive and I can’t seem to get excited about any rug. On the way home, we made a quick stop a block away at Tom Douglas’ <a href="http://tomdouglas.com/index.php?page=seatown">Seatown</a> restaurant to see lights that NB likes for our dining room.</p>

<p>Once we got back to Vashon, we took the kids out to dinner at The Hardware Store.</p>

              <p>To do the low-voltage trim-out work, which will take several days, we decided to stay at the house rather than go back and forth to Vashon everyday. Gay and I went over to the house on Tuesday morning to start. I spent the night there that night and Gay went back to Vashon for the night and brought the kids back on Wednesday to spend a couple more nights at the house. Mark had the plumber trim-out the basement bathroom ahead of schedule so we had a bathroom to use.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5821840828/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3274/5821840828_6e7acb2c3e.jpg" alt="Ladder Rack Junction" /></a></p>

<p>By the end of Tuesday, I had all the CAT6 cables trimmed out in each room and the other ends connected to the patch panel in the basement. I couldn’t test them easily unti my assistant, Gay, got back on Wednesday since that required putting a tester on each end of all 30 cables. That took about 15 minutes using walkie-talkies on Wednesday. All but one worked fine and fixing the one was as easy as re-punching it into the patch panel. I was worried that I crimped or cut several of the cables pulling them through the walls months ago, so I’m amazed I did it right.</p>

<p>Installing all the speakers took a couple days. Mark and Colin had marked on the house plans the precise locations of all the speakers so it was easy to cut the holes in the ceilings. Except for one room. Coincidentally, no pre-cover photos were taken of the lounge, Mark and Colin didn’t mark the locations of the speakers and of all the photos I’ve taken of the house, not a single one showed the ceiling of that room. And we disagreed on the general location in the room where I had decided to locate the speakers, which had been a debate months ago before the drywall went up. We used a toner to locate the general location of the speaker wires in the ceiling, so then it was just a matter of cutting the holes. Even that wasn’t easy, lining up with the centers of the canned lighting in the ceiling, I ended up a half-inch off and hit a joist so Colin had to notch out part of the joist so I could fit the speaker in. The same was true in the master bathroom, which required even more cutting of a joist. It’s good that the house was built with 12-inch joists! I also mostly finished installing the ladder rack in the basement, which was fun.</p>

<p>By the end of the week, I had done as much as I could. Some rooms still had to be painted, so I couldn’t install the speakers yet, but cutting the holes now will make installing the speakers easy. Of the speakers I could install, they all work, so I didn’t leave any bad speaker wire in the wall either. <em>Whew!</em> I’m worried about letting the painters paint the speaker trim…. I have a feeling they’re going to get paint all over the speaker cones on at least a couple of them. We’re going to have them paint them as they’re installed just by dropping them down from the ceiling a little so they can paint them without painting them to the ceiling or having to hand them $350 speakers that they’re likely to drop or otherwise damage. Between this, the sloppy work they’ve done in places and their general negative attitude, we’re kicking ourselves for trying to save money by not hiring the more expensive painters we originally liked. Mark is going to make it clear to them that if they mess up a speaker, they’re paying to replace it and they’re not inexpensive, so hopefully they’ll be careful.</p>

<p>On Wednesday evening we went over to Steve &amp; Renuka’s house, just 10 minutes away!, for dinner. Eric and Mark were in town from New York and London, respectively, so we all got together for the first time since <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2009/05/21/eric-in-london/">Eric showed up in London when we were there</a> two years ago. Our kids and their kids get along great so they entertain themselves and no one seems to get hurt so that lets us pretend we’re kid-free for a few hours.</p>

<p>Hudson had been sick with a cold for a couple days and it seemed to get worse and make him very cranky. Gay took him to his doctor on Thursday and he has a sinus and an ear infection, so he was prescribed antibiotics. This hasn’t made sleeping in a strange place any easier for any of us. While I was working and Gay wasn’t helping me, she took the kids to the park and out for walks. We left Friday afternoon, had a nice dinner at <a href="http://www.porterhouseseattle.com/">Porterhouse</a> in West Seattle for burgers and good beers before going home for an early bedtime.</p>

<p>Staying at the house all week allowed us to watch lots of progress. At one point there were 25 people working in the house simultaneously, which is probably a record. It’s weird seeing so many people walking around your house all day. The staircase and main floor floors were being refinished, which means loud sanders running all day. The family room cabinetry was installed and looks great. The 6-foot guest room sliding door was built from two 3-foot doors. The sauna was being installed. The new sloped concrete top of the garage was poured, so Hudson got to see a couple big trucks. Bill, the electrician, was trimming-out all the electrical.</p>

<p>There’s still quite bit to do yet but it’s looking more and more like a finished house by the day. The last of the hardwood floors are being finished this weekend. The steel shelving needs to be installed in the kitchen so the tile guys can put the tile on the walls there. Once the tile is installed, the painters can paint the master bathroom, kitchen, family room and dining room. The rest of the plumbing (toilets and fixtures) and electrical (switches, outlets, ceiling fans, lights) still has to be trimmed-out. The moving wall in the attic needs to be clad. All the sliding door hardware needs to be finished and installed so all the sliding doors (attic, master bath and kitchen) can be installed. The master bath cabinetry still has to be installed. The glass (shower doors, mirrors) need to be installed. And all the cabinetry pulls need to be installed. Then we can move in!</p>

<p>The move-in date is set for July 8 and we’ve scheduled the movers for that day, so it should be real. It’ll miss the start of the Tour de France by a week, which was my goal, but the first week is all the flat boring stages, so it’s not terrible. I should be able to watch the rest of it at the house, but the decks won’t be done yet so I can’t sit outside in July and watch it like I wanted to. Maybe I will by the end of the race. After we move in, they will still be doing exterior work: patching, repairing and coloring the stucco, building the decks, pouring concrete and some exterior finish work. And the landscaping will start after all that is done. So it’ll be a construction site for a while yet but mostly on the outside.</p>

              <p>To make our weekly visit to the house, I got up early at 5am, which was easy because Eva is sick and not sleeping well so we can’t sleep well either, got my workout done by 6:30a, had a shower, made breakfast for everyone and ate it by a little after 8am. I’d like to start getting up earlier more often. We planned to take Eva with us, but decided to leave her at home with Kelly so she could sleep and get over her sickness. We took Hudson with us instead and he was excited to get the special treatment. He rarely gets time alone with us and we think he needs the break from Havana.</p>

<p>Hudson asked if we could get doughnuts, so we couldn’t resist. Thanks to that we happened to run into our friend Steve at Top Pot Doughnuts and got caught up on what he’s been up to. Then we went to the house.</p>

<p>My, one of the interior designers, happened to be there with the drapery guy measuring for drapes. Gay got a chance to walk around with them and understand why they were recommending what they were, which we didn’t understand yet.</p>

<p>I got started planning the location of the ladder rack installation in the basement to get Gay’s approval. It has to avoid the heating pipes that are already there and the track lighting that isn’t there yet. After an hour discussion between us, Mark and Bill, the electrician, I could get started. By 2pm, I had the holes marked in the joists for half of it and mounted half of those brackets to the joists. Mark showed me how to use a <a href="http://www.google.com/products/catalog?hl=en&amp;nord=1&amp;q=portaband+saw&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;biw=1065&amp;bih=1105&amp;ion=1&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=12759432239122107150&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3wbpTfn_IbLPiAKbmeS0AQ&amp;ved=0CFYQ8gIwAg">porta-band saw</a> (another new tool for me) to cut the threaded rods to the correct length and he helped me mount the first length of the rack. I bought all the equipment sight unseen from <a href="http://www.blackbox.com/">Black Box</a>, so I was worried that it’d be flimsy and cheap, but it’s more sturdy than we need for the few cables and I love how industrial it looks. I immediately realized that the kids are going to be using it as Monkey Bars in a few years.</p>

<p>In other house progress, we saw <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/05/12/thursday-in-seattle/">the replacement glass</a> installed in the family room door, the drying rack that we designed (and re-designed) built in the laundry room, the basement, attic and master bedroom painted, light switches starting to be installed and actually turning on/off lights, scaffolding constructed around the entire house and our office wall track installed and the frame mounted and working. The next month is going to show a lot of rapid progress.</p>

<p>We’re planning to sleep most of the week at the house next week so I can finish the ladder rack installation and do all my low-voltage trim-out work – the speaker installations and wall outlets – without having to go back and forth to Vashon every morning and evening. Mark is trying to get the plumbers to the house to install one toilet and get a shower working for us while we stay there. I’m looking forward to that. I may even get to help out with the sauna installation if they haven’t finished it by then.</p>

              <p>Today is Memorial Day, the day we remember the people who died serving in our military. Those people deserve the honor. Unfortunately, it’s become co-opted  to say these people died “protecting our freedom”. It sounds patriotic and respectful, but it’s not true. Soldiers are protecting the country, but our freedoms are protected by our Constitution. Our Constitution is threatened and defended every day, but not by any military.</p>

<blockquote>Abraham Lincoln: "America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves."</blockquote>

<p>The people who protect our freedom every day are lawyers, including politicians and judges, who fight to uphold the Constitution. It’s protected by journalists, who inform and educate the world about threats to the Constitution. People have died doing those jobs too but no one memorializes them as having “protected our freedom”.</p>

<p>I’m grateful that there are people who are willing to risk their lives serving in our military, and I’m equally grateful to the people who spent decades studying the Constitution and the Law and get up and go to work every day fighting threats to our freedoms. When the ACLU sues someone who infringes on someone else’s civil rights, they are protecting your freedom from those who would like to take your rights away. When a lawyer sues a corporation in what people call “a frivolous lawsuit”, they are protecting your freedom to have your voice heard (and having it heard peacefully). When an “activist judge” makes a decision you don’t agree with, they are protecting your freedom from those who disagree with you. When a newspaper publishes a story you don’t want to have heard, they are protecting your freedom to publish a story you want to have heard.</p>

<p>Memorial Day is supposed to commemorate those who died serving in the military. Let’s keep it that way. However, if Memorial Day is going to be changed to be the holiday we honor those who died protecting our freedom, it should include dead lawyers, politicians and journalists.</p>
