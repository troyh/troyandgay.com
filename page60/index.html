              <p>To make our weekly visit to the house, I got up early at 5am, which was easy because Eva is sick and not sleeping well so we can’t sleep well either, got my workout done by 6:30a, had a shower, made breakfast for everyone and ate it by a little after 8am. I’d like to start getting up earlier more often. We planned to take Eva with us, but decided to leave her at home with Kelly so she could sleep and get over her sickness. We took Hudson with us instead and he was excited to get the special treatment. He rarely gets time alone with us and we think he needs the break from Havana.</p>

<p>Hudson asked if we could get doughnuts, so we couldn’t resist. Thanks to that we happened to run into our friend Steve at Top Pot Doughnuts and got caught up on what he’s been up to. Then we went to the house.</p>

<p>My, one of the interior designers, happened to be there with the drapery guy measuring for drapes. Gay got a chance to walk around with them and understand why they were recommending what they were, which we didn’t understand yet.</p>

<p>I got started planning the location of the ladder rack installation in the basement to get Gay’s approval. It has to avoid the heating pipes that are already there and the track lighting that isn’t there yet. After an hour discussion between us, Mark and Bill, the electrician, I could get started. By 2pm, I had the holes marked in the joists for half of it and mounted half of those brackets to the joists. Mark showed me how to use a <a href="http://www.google.com/products/catalog?hl=en&amp;nord=1&amp;q=portaband+saw&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;biw=1065&amp;bih=1105&amp;ion=1&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=12759432239122107150&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3wbpTfn_IbLPiAKbmeS0AQ&amp;ved=0CFYQ8gIwAg">porta-band saw</a> (another new tool for me) to cut the threaded rods to the correct length and he helped me mount the first length of the rack. I bought all the equipment sight unseen from <a href="http://www.blackbox.com/">Black Box</a>, so I was worried that it’d be flimsy and cheap, but it’s more sturdy than we need for the few cables and I love how industrial it looks. I immediately realized that the kids are going to be using it as Monkey Bars in a few years.</p>

<p>In other house progress, we saw <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/05/12/thursday-in-seattle/">the replacement glass</a> installed in the family room door, the drying rack that we designed (and re-designed) built in the laundry room, the basement, attic and master bedroom painted, light switches starting to be installed and actually turning on/off lights, scaffolding constructed around the entire house and our office wall track installed and the frame mounted and working. The next month is going to show a lot of rapid progress.</p>

<p>We’re planning to sleep most of the week at the house next week so I can finish the ladder rack installation and do all my low-voltage trim-out work – the speaker installations and wall outlets – without having to go back and forth to Vashon every morning and evening. Mark is trying to get the plumbers to the house to install one toilet and get a shower working for us while we stay there. I’m looking forward to that. I may even get to help out with the sauna installation if they haven’t finished it by then.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Today is Memorial Day, the day we remember the people who died serving in our military. Those people deserve the honor. Unfortunately, it’s become co-opted  to say these people died “protecting our freedom”. It sounds patriotic and respectful, but it’s not true. Soldiers are protecting the country, but our freedoms are protected by our Constitution. Our Constitution is threatened and defended every day, but not by any military.</p>

<blockquote>Abraham Lincoln: "America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves."</blockquote>

<p>The people who protect our freedom every day are lawyers, including politicians and judges, who fight to uphold the Constitution. It’s protected by journalists, who inform and educate the world about threats to the Constitution. People have died doing those jobs too but no one memorializes them as having “protected our freedom”.</p>

<p>I’m grateful that there are people who are willing to risk their lives serving in our military, and I’m equally grateful to the people who spent decades studying the Constitution and the Law and get up and go to work every day fighting threats to our freedoms. When the ACLU sues someone who infringes on someone else’s civil rights, they are protecting your freedom from those who would like to take your rights away. When a lawyer sues a corporation in what people call “a frivolous lawsuit”, they are protecting your freedom to have your voice heard (and having it heard peacefully). When an “activist judge” makes a decision you don’t agree with, they are protecting your freedom from those who disagree with you. When a newspaper publishes a story you don’t want to have heard, they are protecting your freedom to publish a story you want to have heard.</p>

<p>Memorial Day is supposed to commemorate those who died serving in the military. Let’s keep it that way. However, if Memorial Day is going to be changed to be the holiday we honor those who died protecting our freedom, it should include dead lawyers, politicians and journalists.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>We went into Seattle to go to University Village. Hudson still prefers not to use the toilet unless it’s on the ferry, which he’s learned will allow him to go out on the deck of the ferry to see the water after he’s done going potty. Today was no exception. I took him and Havana up to the bathroom and, while Hudson was waiting for Havana to finish, he was holding onto the bathroom stall wall while I was helping Havana when an idiot walked into the nextdoor stall and closed the door and locked it, squishing Hudson’s finger in the door.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Hudson can scream like nobody’s business and this guy was oblivious to the screams echoing through the bathroom. I had to beat on the door and yell at him to get him to unlock the door. When he finally did, he had a dumb look on his face like he had no idea what was going on. Even after I told him that Hudson’s fingers were caught in the door, it took him several seconds to understand and even then had to ask “Oh, did I close the door on his fingers?”. <em>Yes, you did you moron!</em> He was probably drunk, stoned or both – he looked like a guy who had been sitting out in the sun all day. He apologized, but what a clueless clod. Hudson finally stopped crying when I got him back to the car with mommy, but his finger was clearly hurting all the way to University Village where we got him some ice cream.</p>

<p>Poor Hudson, he seems to get hurt a lot more often than Havana does. He has a short memory, though, because on the way home he asked again to go up to the bathroom. This time there was no injury and he had a blast running around on the windy deck.</p>

              <p>While Gay went to Costco to buy <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/05/26/hot-tub-and-house-update/">the hot tub</a>, I stayed at the house to start installing the ladder rack in the basement. Jon and Megan came over at 6 to see the house and Gay got back soon after. We gave them a tour of the house and then went to Volunteer Park Cafe for the <a href="http://www.stonebrew.com/">Stone Brewing Co.</a> beer dinner, an event I have been looking forward to since we had to cancel our reservation for last year’s event. Dinner was excellent but the beers were mostly standard Stone beers (Levitation Ale, Pale Ale, IPA) and the only Stone beer I hadn’t had before was their Highway 78 Scotch Ale, which unfortunately, is not available in Washington State – I really liked that . Their Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale was the stand-out for me, certainly the best Black IPA/Cascadian Dark Ale I’ve had since it’s a style I’m not fond of.</p>

              <p>We’re working on the plans for the house’s backyard, so it’s time to order the hot tub. We went over to Bellevue to <a href="http://www.richshome.com/locations.asp?map=Bellevue">Rich’s</a> to see <a href="http://www.clearwaterspas.com/index.cfm">Clearwater Spas</a> and then to Aqua-Quip to see <a href="http://www.sundancespas.com/">Sundance Spas</a>. We were essentially decided on a Clearwater Spas hot tub but wanted to see them all in-person and select the exact model and check out the color options before committing. We didn’t like the Sundance Spas, so we stuck with Clearwater. They’ve all got Memorial Day sales (it’s not just for mattresses anymore, I guess) right now but it turns out that Clearwater Spas, a local company, is at Costco this week selling them directly. Rich’s would sell it for about $2,000 off their normal price, but we saved an additional $3000 off Rich’s price. $5,000 will buy lots of beer – I love you, Costco!</p>

<p>Hot tubs are a weird market. Not many people buy them, as opposed to something like TVs, and of the people that do buy them, they only buy one or two in their lifetime, so there’s not a lot of good information or reviews about hot tubs. This makes it hard to separate the good from the bad. This leads me to believe that they’re all not very good. They certainly still look ugly with their fake plastic wood sides (note to manufacturers: you’re not fooling anyone, we all know it’s plastic. Embrace it and stop trying to make it look like wood.) and there’s been some (arguable) progress in the chlorine smell, maintenance headaches and operating costs. Our decision was based on the seating options, the number of jets and, as best as we can tell, how reputable the company is. And price, of course. We figure all hot tubs will need repairs eventually, so we just need to be able to get the replacement parts. Clearwater is local and if we buy directly from them, they do the repairs themselves, which seems better than the hit-or-miss service you get from a dealer. Clearwater seems to be higher-end, but still doesn’t have the reputation that Jacuzzi, Sundance and Hot Springs do, but again, it’s hard to tell if you’re paying more for them because of the quality or because of better marketing.</p>

<p>Most of the hot tubs that Schuchart/Dow installs are custom-made and accompany a pool. We don’t have a pool and all the construction labor and equipment to subsidize the cost of the hot tub, so building a custom hot tub would be at least twice as expensive as buying a manufactured hot tub, and that’s without the design costs. A custom hot tub would also not have the contoured seating that a manufactured one has and it’d be harder to find a repairman for a custom hot tub. So we went with a manufactured one. We planned to use the house’s boiler and a heat exchanger that we’ve already installed in the house to heat the hot tub and avoid the electricity costs of heating a hot tub too, but we discovered that that will void the manufacturer’s warranty since they are self-contained units. Hot tub manufacturers cite a $10-17/mo cost to keep a hot tub heated 24x7 and argue that they’re so efficient these days, there’s no reason to use a heat exchanger. It’s plausible if they’re insulated well, but I will be shocked if it costs that little in reality. The heat exchanger would have essentially been free. Fortunately, our HVAC contractor, Premier, who has been fantastic throughout the project, is willing to remove the heat exchanger and refund us the cost.</p>

<p>We went to the house to check on the progress. It’s still mostly painting that’s going on so not a lot is happening. They built the island top to hold the marble so we can now see the actual size of the island (it’s big!), they’re building the laundry room shelving and appliances are being installed. The heating pipes in the basement were painted and we’ve been wary of the color that the designers picked, a purplish/greyish color. I don’t understand why we can’t just pick a simple black, but I trust their opinions on color over my own. But I saw it and hated it – it was brown! After a bit of head-scratching, we figured out that the painters used the wrong color. Every sub-contractor has been great so far, but Mark’s been having trouble with the painters almost from the beginning and we got a firsthand look at how they all pointed fingers at each other and offered excuses for using the wrong color.</p>

<p>Aside: I’ve never understood why humans spend so much energy denying mistakes and so little fixing mistakes. It’s as if they try to pretend they’re perfect and admitting to a mistake is a crack in their facade. No (intelligent) person has ever been convinced another person is perfect, so you look like a jackass pretending to be. Besides, mistakes always happen, so if you haven’t made a mistake, you haven’t done much work. And mistakes are the best way to learn, so if you haven’t made a mistake, you haven’t had the opportunity to learn, so you’re probably bad at what you do. So be proud of your mistakes, learn from them and everyone’s better-off (and there’s a lot less whining and resentment).</p>

<p>After wasting 5 minutes listening to three guys try to avoid blame, Mark found the can with the correct color and, because it was quittin’ time, there was a short struggle to get them to paint some of it on the pipes now so we could see it and decide on the color once and for all. I was getting tired of their finger-pointing and was about to open the can and do the sample myself, but Mark said he wanted to make the laziest guy do it. If they hadn’t wasted 5 minutes denying the mistake, they could have taken 30 seconds to paint a sample of the correct color and left 4.5 minutes earlier.</p>

<p>After that was all done and as the paint dried, I still didn’t like the color. Mark says that Tom Kundig always uses one black (like he always uses one white that we’re using for the walls) so we’re going to get a sample of that and compare it. I’ll be surprised if Tom’s color isn’t the right color.</p>
