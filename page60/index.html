          <p>We went to the house today to go over the millwork with the millwork guy, adjust the foyer speakers (which someone already did), test the speakers in the house and decide on exact speaker locations in each room.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5415329946/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5059/5415329946_ec6d0a9812.jpg" alt="Basement with drywall" /></a></p>

<p>We got the see the basement drywalled and the taping guy was there doing his work. For the first time, we see real walls and can get a better sense of the space in each room. The drywallers were stocking all the drywall and materials for the other floors too with a boom that lifted everything through the windows in the upper floors.</p>

<p>The exterior wall on the garage had been removed and they found that it isn’t plumb, so that needs to be fixed. They’ll put a door in it and a new surface on it and we’re going to have it stuccoed to match the house. This has held up the garage interior framing this week, but should resume next week. I’m hoping I can help out with that work, maybe lay the floor down since that’s easy.</p>

<p>Mark had picked up some more 2x6s for me so I built 3 more speaker boxes to mount the speakers. I then tested them in the living room to see which we prefer. We had picked our favorite of the 3 pairs at home, but the difference was negligible. But when we played them all at the house, the difference was striking – the one we preferred, Noble Fidelity, had a more clear sound that filled the room and the bass was much more pronounced. I assume the difference was more noticeable because the room is bigger, had no furniture in it and the walls and floor were wood rather than drywall and carpet. The receiver at the house was also 100 watts versus the 65 watt I used at home, which should also make a big difference.</p>

<p>We made some changes with Mark and Colin to the speaker placement in each room before the drywall goes up. I’ll go in next week once the drywall is up to cut holes in the ceilings. We also made yet more slight changes with Bill, the electrician, for some wiring.</p>

<p>We got out of the house by 4pm, picked up Thai take-out dinner, made a quick stop at The Beer Junction to stock up for the Super Bowl, missed the 5pm ferry, waited for the 5:40pm ferry and got home by 6pm. That’s 2  hours to go from Capitol Hill to Vashon, 80 minutes of that to go just the last 3 miles by boat! To compare, we could drive from Seattle to Portland or Vancouver, Canada in 3 hours.</p>

          <p>I built little boxes to simulate a wall for each speaker:</p>

<p>It’s hard to tell them apart, though. Maybe some beer will help.</p>

          <p>Kelly had to go to her grandfather’s funeral today and Gay had a doctor’s appointment in the city so we piled all 3 kids in the Jeep and went to the house. We stopped at Home Depot to pick up a sheet of drywall and drywall screws so I could build my little walls to mount the speakers in. I also brought <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/01/30/triad-ds-100-speakers/">the Triad speakers</a> along to install at the house.</p>

<p>After a quick stop at the Starbucks drive-in for coffee and breakfast goodies, we got to the house. The drywall and materials were being stocked in the house and we saw all the insulation that was put in last week. Gay left Hudson with me while she, Havana and Eva went to her doctor’s appointment. Hudson played with the iPad while I worked on installing the foyer speakers. Gay got back with lunch and then took the kids out for haircuts (they couldn’t get in, so no haircuts) and for some playtime at University Village. I got the speakers installed, but one needs some adjustment, and tested them to make sure they work.</p>

<p>We stopped at Zeek’s on the way home for dinner, the first time all 5 of us went out to dinner together.</p>

          <p>I’ve been working on selecting the audio/video equipment for those house and we’ll be putting in-ceiling speakers in most of the rooms. They’ll mostly be unseen, unless you look up at the ceiling, but in the foyer we couldn’t put speakers in the ceiling because the ceiling is inaccessible without disturbing the woodwork. We could have put in-wall speakers in the foyer but in-wall speakers are more noticeable since you tend to look at walls. I found some truly invisible speakers from <a href="http://www.triadspeakers.com/designerseries/products/ds100.html">Triad</a>. They mount in the drywall and get plastered over with the surrounding drywall so it looks like a normal wall.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5402157401/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5292/5402157401_393aa6527e.jpg" alt="Triad DS100 speakers" /></a></p>

<p>I read <a href="http://www.hometheater.com/inwallspeakers/triad_ds500_in-wall_speaker_system/">a review of the higher-end model</a> that sounded good, but I was still skeptical. They arrived on Friday and I got a chance to test them today. I’m not an audiophile by any means, but I’m impressed. I assumed they’d sound muddy, but the sound is very bright. In fact, there’s very little bass at all, since they require that you also use a high-pass filter to filter out the lower frequency sound so as not to knock plaster off the wall. The highs are every bit as bright as my 16 year-old floor-standing Klipsch speakers, possibly more. They just lack any low-range sound. I bet a subwoofer would make these good enough for mid-range dedicated listening speakers.</p>

<p>These are going to get installed in the  house this week, possibly even tomorrow, since the drywall is starting to go in this week.</p>

<p>At $550/ea, they’re more expensive than the traditional in-ceiling speakers we’re going to use in the rest of the house. I ordered three pairs of speakers in the $300-350/ea price range from <a href="http://www.klipsch.com/">Klipsch</a>, <a href="http://www.definitivetech.com/">Definitive Technology</a> and <a href="http://www.noble-fidelity.com/">Noble Fidelity</a> to decide on what to use where total invisibility isn’t required. Those should arrive this week and I’m excited to test them.</p>

<p>Our new neighborhood has an annual “progressive” dinner, a dinner where each course (appetizers, dinner and dessert) are hosted at a different house. People who don’t host bring and prepare the food. Tonight was the 25th annual dinner and we were invited. Kelly could work today so we could go sans kids – our first evening out since Eva’s birth.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Gay made crab cakes and brought a cheese platter. Everyone brings 2 bottles of wine, but I was asked to bring beer so we stopped at The Beer Junction on the way. We had already met many of the neighbors but there were a few more that we got to meet. Appetizers were at the Pipers’ across the street, the main course was at the Welland/Jordan’s and dessert was at the Willison’s house. The food was great and I was surprised to find that I really liked the Imperial Pilsner that I brought, which was intended to be palatable to non-beer nerds like me. Between courses, we cleaned up and pack up the wine/beer and all walk to the next house.</p>

<p>Each year they award a Gardening award to someone in the neighborhood and this year <em>we won it</em> for taking down the Monkey Puzzle Trees! Either no one else did anything to their gardens this year or the neighborhood appreciates the removal of those trees almost as much as I do. The award is a large bottle of Galliano that must stay at your house for the year before moving to the next winner’s house. This bottle has clearly made the rounds for many years.</p>

<p>We heard some good advice about preschools – lots of choices! The street also has some cycling fans, and we talked about spending the month of July glued to the TV every year watching the Tour de France. I’m really looking forward to that in the new house – I specifically designed the TV location, doors and deck location so that I could watch the TdF while on the hammock outside. Several of the guys on the street go for a 2-hour bike ride every Sunday morning at 7:30a, rain or shine. I haven’t been on a group bike ride since ‘98 or ‘99 so I’m looking forward to being able to get back on the bike again and show these guys how slow I can go.</p>

<p>We didn’t leave until 10:30p, so we missed the 10:20p ferry home but made it to the dock in plenty of time to catch the 11:40p ferry and get home after midnight. I won’t miss the ferries.</p>
