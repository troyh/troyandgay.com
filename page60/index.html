          </h3>
            <p>Kelly could work late to watch the kids so we could go out to dinner for <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/03/22/happy-birthday-gay-4/">Gay’s birthday</a>. We left at 1pm, went to the house to check on progress and then to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=roche+bobois+seattle&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=roche+bobois&amp;hnear=Seattle,+WA&amp;cid=1891254643517170645">Roche-Bobois</a> downtown to look at a sectional that the designers suggested. We checked out a couple other furniture stores near there and then made our way to <a href="http://www.tavernlaw.com/">Tavern Law</a> for a drink before dinner.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I made a reservation at <a href="http://www.spinasse.com/">Cascina Spinasse</a> for 6:30p and they stressed to me that they can’t hold a reservation so we had to be there promptly at 6:30p. A couple days earlier, I had secretly emailed some of Gay’s friends telling them they can meet us at Tavern Law at 5:30 for a drink if they were nearby. I didn’t know how long we’d be at the bar, so I was worried it’d be hard to make our reservation on time. That turned out to be true, we ended up staying at the bar with everyone until after 7.</p>

<p>Gay was surprised to see her friends showing up and some of her friends were surprised it was a surprise. I’m terrible at planning Gay’s birthdays because my ideal birthday (actually, my ideal day) is having a quiet dinner at home but Gay likes to be out and about celebrating with people. Reid, Marissa, Megan, Jon, Stephanie, Matt and Renuka all made it and we practically filled the tiny place. Technically, Alex and Niles made it too, but they misread my confusing mail and showed up the previous night (and emailed me asking where we were).</p>

<p>For dinner, We ended up just walking up the street to <a href="http://www.barriorestaurant.com/">Barrio</a>, which we saw on our way to Tavern Law and liked the looks of the place – big steel doors, thick wood tables, etc. This place has a very cool interior with an amazing wall of candles (that apparently takes 45 minutes to light). As we sat down, Kelly texted Gay and said that Havana and Hudson both had diarrhea so Gay was anxious about that, but Kelly assured her that they’re fine. We had a good dinner and made the 10:20p ferry home.</p>

            <p>Gay turned 41 today. It’s the first time since 2008 that we celebrated her birthday at home. I made dinner tonight and we’re going out to dinner tomorrow night.</p>

<p>She’s more wise, more fun and more beautiful than the day I met her. I met her just before she turned 27. She was successful and a powerful personality at Microsoft then, a difficult thing in a male-dominant environment like Microsoft at the time, and I loved her confidence and ability to make things happen. 14 years later, she’s my wife, business/career partner and the mother to my 3 kids. It’s been a great time for me (less so for her, I’m sure) and I hope it lasts another 80 years.</p>

            <p>Eva is 3 months old today. She’s still a good baby, eating regularly, sleeping well and surviving her brother and sister. She now hates wet diapers and complains until they’re changed. She is starting baby talk, saying “Ga”, and smiles at faces.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We’re putting reclaimed wood on a wall of cabinetry and on our office doors. Schuchart/Dow used <a href="http://pioneermillworks.com/">Pioneer Millworks</a> to order the wood a few weeks ago. Last week, we decided to not use it on the office doors because it’s too difficult to assemble doors out of it and mount it to track system – the labor to assemble and install the doors would triple the cost. So Schuchart/Dow called Pioneer Millworks to cancel 30% of the order (the amount for the doors) and they told them that they would charge us a 20% restocking fee for the cancellation. 20% is high, but the wood hasn’t even left their warehouse yet, so there’s no reason to charge a restocking fee at all! They don’t have to deal with handling a return, verifying that they received what they’re supposed to, deal with damage, etc. It felt like a threat to keep us from canceling an order they’ve booked more than a legitimate fee.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>Schuchart/Dow told them what we thought of that restocking fee but they held their ground, so I decided I’d deal directly with them myself and got the salesman’s contact info. I called him today, he answered his phone and when he realized who I was and why I was calling, he told me that he was in a meeting and had to call me back. So a stranger’s call is important enough to interrupt a meeting but an existing customer isn’t. It’s better to <em>not</em> be a customer of Pioneer Millworks, apparently.</p>

<p>He called me back an hour later and told me this order is a small order and they’re only handling the order as “a favor” (his words) to Schuchart/Dow. Oh, I see: He doesn’t really want our money and doesn’t want us as a customer, he’s just doing it as a favor to someone else. What a saint. And if he’s so eager to please Schuchart/Dow, why’d he give them such a hard time about the restocking fee?</p>

<p>And I doubt that he’s being honest about it being a small order to them. It’s about 300 square feet of wood. I’m sure they do much larger orders, but <a href="http://pioneermillworks.com/galleries/residential-gallery">their web site gallery</a> has plenty of examples that are of similarly-sized and smaller orders. To his credit, he agreed to not charge the restocking fee, but a good salesperson would have said “We want our customers to be happy and we appreciate your business, so I’m going to waive the restocking fee.” But he said, effectively, “I want you to understand that I’m not doing this to please you, my customer and the person paying me, I’m doing this to please someone else.”</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Since the iPad 2 is going on sale today, we decided to go the house again so I could do some work and Gay could go to <a href="http://www.albertleeappliance.com/seattle.php">Albert Lee</a> and <a href="http://www.builders-hardware.com/default.aspx">Builder’s Hardware</a> to look at stuff. We took the kids with us too so we could go to dinner before getting the iPad. I hate waiting in lines, so I wasn’t going to wait in line for the iPad and was hoping that I could walk in a couple hours later and pick one up.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5526955824/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5214/5526955824_581e03c387.jpg" alt="IMG_0764" /></a></p>

<p>Since the drywallers were done with their work and would start working on the patched areas around the house, I had to finally move the living room speaker holes. I had originally made holes down the center line of the room, but after getting <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/02/04/noble-fidelity-speakers/">an education on speaker placement from Noble Fidelity</a>, I wanted to move them closer to the wall. Using a Fein tool, I cut the plaster out and then the lathes out and could pull the speaker wire from the other hole to the new ones. Cutting plaster is a dirty job, especially when it’s on the ceiling, so I was covered in plaster dust. Then I went to the garage to finish a small bit of masonite and tried screwing-down the existing masonite because it all bubbled since I installed it. More screws helped most of it, but there’s a couple sheets that need to be re-done.</p>

<p>The fireplace was delivered today, so I got to see that. It should go in next week. The drywallers were priming the attic, the last of the priming work. They finished that today so the entire house is drywalled, taped, mudded and primed. The tile guy was still working on the basement bath tile and almost finished. It looks fantastic, much better than I was expecting because this tile was chosen as a less expensive version of the one we chose for the master bath. Now I’m worried that the master bath tile won’t look good enough to justify the cost – how much better can it be? Kurt and Colin were putting the wood trim around the windows that have all been replaced and painted.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, the short concrete wall around the top of the garage was removed to make way for the decking and to allow water to drain off the side rather than through a drain in the center. Now we can get rid of the drain because I hate drains – they’re always clogged, require maintenance and you’re just throwing the water away into the sewer system instead of using it for irrigation.</p>

<p>Gay went to Albert Lee to look at refrigerators. The one she wants is super expensive and I’ve been trying to get her to find a less expensive alternative. I hadn’t been successful yet but I suggested getting a commercial refrigerator and freezer from <a href="http://truemfg.com/">True</a> that also look just as cool, but are much much cheaper. It turns out those are very loud, way too loud for a residential environment, which I wouldn’t like. They also lack the consumer-friendly features like crisper drawers, adjustable bins and easy-to-clean shelves. She told the sales guy at Albert Lee that I’ve been complaining about the cost and, since we’re buying so much stuff (fridge, beverage fridge, beer fridge, ice-maker, stove &amp; oven, vent hood, microwave, dishwasher, washer &amp; dryer) at one time, he could knock of a few hundred dollars here and there and, with the current Sub-Zero/Wolf sale, we ended up getting more than $4,000 off. So sometimes whining works (don’t tell the kids!). Even with the discount, the fridge is still more than any other fridge, but it looks better than any other fridge and I can’t argue with Sub-Zero quality and the customer service we’ve had with the 20 year-old Sub-Zero in our current house – it’s been problem-free and they replaced the entire ice-maker system for free a couple years ago when Gay told them she didn’t like to see the minerals in the ice (which we think ended up being caused by Vashon’s harder water).</p>

<p>After I was done working, we went to the Apple store down the street at U Village and found a line that wrapped around the entire block and then some. I was afraid of that. We went next door the Ram Brewery for dinner to wait out the line. We also ran into Steve, Renuka and their kids there. At 7pm the line was still there but much shorter so I went in but found that they were sold out of iPads. Oh well. I wish Apple did the reservation system they did last year for the original iPad so I could reserve it and walk right in to pick it up, but I guess they really wanted to see long lines – sometimes Apple’s anti-customer/pro-marketing dark side rears its ugly head.</p>
