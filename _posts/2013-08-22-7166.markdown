We met with the design firm in the morning for a couple hours. They showed us 8 (!) concepts, all very good, and we had a good discussion about them. We left thinking it'd be hard to choose between a few of them. 

After that, we walked to [Eataly](http://www.eataly.com/) for lunch at [Birreria](http://www.eataly.com/birreria/). Ben Brotman met us there and we had beers and lunch.

Then we all went to [The High Line](http://www.thehighline.org/) park for a walk and to [the Bier Garten at The Standard](http://standardhotels.com/high-line/food-drink/biergarten) for a beer (where the waitress thought an Oktoberfest and a Hefeweizen are the same thing).

Then we all went to [The Ginger Man](http://www.gingerman-ny.com/) for more beers.

Ben left to take the bus back home and Gay and I went to [Nougatine](http://www.jean-georgesrestaurant.com/mobile/jean-georges/about/nougatine-at-jean-georges/) for dinner. We happened to watch the documentary [Somm](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/mobile/m/somm/) on the plane ride and when the sommelier came over she was wearing her Advanced Sommelier pin on her lapel – she had just passed the test on Friday – and we had a fun conversation about that with her. I'm not much of a wine person but I am impressed with the dedication a sommelier has to go through (and pass!) those tests.
