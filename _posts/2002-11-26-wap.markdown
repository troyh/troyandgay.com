I got the new firewall machine up on Sunday, after a frustrating weekend. The new firewall is [iptables](http://netfilter.samba.org) (the old was ipchains) so it's much more powerful & flexible. The big win is that I can do forwarding to fumweb so I can get access via my cell phone! So now I can get CPU stats and even recent analog reports!

Now I can kick back, drink beer and just check stats on my cell phone all day. Woo hoo!
