I have to agree with [Salon on Radiohead's new album](http://www.salon.com/ent/music/review/2003/06/18/radiohead/index_np.html). Radiohead has no clothes. Sometime after their perfect album [OK Computer](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/r/radiohead/ok-computer.shtml), which was the best album of the 1990s as far as I'm concerned, Thom Yorke lost his mind. I have tried and tried and tried to like _Kid A_, _Amnesiac_ and _Hail To The Thief_ and the meaning behind the albums resonates very well with me, but it's futile. They're simply not very good albums musically. And in spite of, or maybe because of, the critical acclaim he received, Thom Yorke suffers from Michael Stipes' disease from early in his career: he's not confident in his lyric-writing ability so he "sings" the songs so that the lyrics are indecipherable.

The 56-minute album has some bright spots. _I Will_, _Sail To The Moon_ and _There There_ are among Radiohead's best ever. But the rest of the songs are filled with incoherent melodies, barely catchy choruses and songs that just drone on and on and on and on.

_2+2=5_ starts like it's the beginning of a masterpiece album with music that made Radiohead great and Thom's voice carrying the song halfway  through where it immediately turns into a mess of bland guitar rock. _Sit Down, Stand Up_ also starts great, but like the first song just falls into the longest minute ever of "The raindrops" repeated over and over with a heavy bass riff filled out with 1950s science fiction sound effects. _Sail To The Moon_ is classic Radiohead guitar with a tinkling piano and Thom's ethereal voice. _Backdrifts_ sounds like a song played backwards (ever get a headache listening to sounds in reverse?); nothing interesting here at all... for an annoying 5 minutes 22 seconds. _Go To Sleep_ would have been great on their first album, [Pablo Honey](http://rateyourmusic.com/view_album_details/album_id_is_47), but it's boring 10 years later. _We Suck Young Blood_ is not even worth talking about. If _The Gloaming_ (and its more backwards music) doesn't make you want to commit suicide that's probably because they made it one of the shortest songs on the album. _There There_ and _I Will_ are the other two great songs on the album. _A Punch Up At A Wedding_ features drums and piano and Thom singing about a drunk fight at a wedding. Piano, drums are innovative? Then we fall again into a pit of the same old noise-filled monotony with _Myxomatosis_ and  the album ends with the uneventful _Scatterbrain_ and _A Wolf At The Door_. Blah. And I even bought the "Special Edition" version of the CD which contains nothing of interest except a poster for the goth kiddies to stick on their wall to prove to their parents that the world sucks.

Pitchfork Media concluded [their review](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/r/radiohead/ok-computer.shtml) of _OK Computer_ with what is now a prophetic notion: _Radiohead only seem to get better as time progresses, but Thom Yorke's expressed some doubt as to whether or not they can ever top this record.  If they can, they'll have established themselves as one of the most outstanding rock bands the '90s had to offer.  If not, they still came out of the deal with one album of unadulterated genius.  Time will tell._

In 20  years, if people are still talking about Radiohead, it will be _OK Computer_ that they are remembered for. Innovation in music is good and badly-needed, but that doesn't mean that _anything_ innovative is good music.  It'd be refreshing if everyone would just admit what I think we all know.
