Just two days after the cancellation of his "bet on which Americans will die next" plan, [Poindexter plans to retire](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3115135.stm). Poindexter is also the creator of the [Total Information Awareness](http://www.darpa.mil/iao/TIASystems.htm) program, trying to get rid of those pesky civil rights we Americans enjoy. I guess the Bush Administration will need to find someone else to skirt The Constitution. Does [Joseph McCarthy](http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/60.htm) have any offspring?
