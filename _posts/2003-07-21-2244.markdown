Uh oh! I can't explain how I know this just yet, but I know there is **big** news about the Tour de France and/or Lance Armstrong on the front pages of both the New York Times and CNN! I have a bad bad feeling about this. I don't know how I'm going to wait til tonight to watch the coverage. _Ugh!_ Turning off radio, being extra careful with reading email and avoiding any news-related web site today!
