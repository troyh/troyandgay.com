We need to look into [these options](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001254.shtml) for [VoIP](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/VOIP). I've been wanting to get rid of our land lines for a long time now. TiVo and the need to call a friend of mine in Greece keeps us on a $20/mo phone line. But our TiVo is now networked and if I can get 5Â¢ a minute to Greece with VoIP, wow.
