The Toronto Star [mentioned us](http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1041591786304&call_page=TS_News&call_pageid=968332188492&call_pagepath=News/News) in a list of dieting web sites. Under recipes, it lists only Epicurious and ! Unfortunately, they pointed out an errant low-cal recipe and they called us "Recipe Zaar". But press is good.
