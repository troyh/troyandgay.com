One of the most annoying things is that MSN Messenger, the OS X version at least, often gives me this message in a chat:

If you don't know whether Lee will respond or whether Lee is a male or female, why broach the topics? Why not make it simply:

I can deduce that Lee may or may not respond. Besides, Lee may or may not respond regardless of whether or not they are away, not _because_ they are away. And I do know whether Lee is a male or female so it's pointless for Messenger to demonstrate its ignorance about it, especially when it doesn't matter.
