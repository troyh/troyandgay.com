Just as we're preparing to increase the capacity of [the site](http://recipezaar.com), one server maxed out during the peak time-of-day today and was unavailable for an hour. Fortunately, I think I know exactly what happened: 3 events occurred simultaneously that just overloaded it. We'll prevent that from happening in the future. Live & learn!
