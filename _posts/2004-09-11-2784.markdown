For the first time, Microsoft has stated in their SEC filing that "Linux servers outpaced Microsoft's for the first time in terms of growth percentage.":http://money.cnn.com/2004/09/09/technology/techinvestor/hellweg/  And, significantly, linux installations are under-reported since many linux servers are bought without an OS -- we have ~20 (I've stopped counting) linux servers and none register as linux servers since they were all purchased without an OS and we installed the OS ourselves.
