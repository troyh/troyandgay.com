[Eric & Valerie](http://troyandgay.com/2009/12/09/eric-valerie-in-cabo/) are in town for a few days, visiting from France, so they had a get-together at [Bastille](http://bastilleseattle.com) in Ballard. Since Ballard is hard to get to for us, we thought we'd visit our friend Robyn who is building her brewery in Ballard, [Stoup Brewing Co](http://www.stoupbrewing.com). Their equipment was delivered a couple weeks ago and they're still setting it up, getting the boiler and chiller installed and building cold rooms and their tasting room. A block away is [Reuben's Brews](http://reubensbrews.com), so we stopped over there for some sampler beers.

Then we went to Bastille for dinner and drinks with Eric, Valerie and a bunch of people we rarely see these days.
