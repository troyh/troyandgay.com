We drove to Portland to "The Nines":http://www.starwoodhotels.com/luxury/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=1757 hotel to stay there for a couple nights.

The Nines is a new Portland luxury hotel but they're suffering so Gay got a good deal on a suite (there's positives to economic downturns!), which is the only type of room to stay in with kids who go to bed at 7pm.

Our room wasn't ready when we got there so the hotel sent us to the bar to wait with free cocktails. After moving into the room, we went back to the Deschutes Public House for dinner, which is a very comfortable place to take tired kids.
