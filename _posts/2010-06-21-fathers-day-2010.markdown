Happy Father's Day to me! This is my 4th Father's Day (2nd with Hudson). I spent the rainy day inside by the fire reading a Father's Day gift, "[The Rational Optimist](http://www.rationaloptimist.com/)", watched a World Cup game and a movie while Gay and the kids napped after a [late night out](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/06/19/washington-brewers-festival/) (for us) last night.
