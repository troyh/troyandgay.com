A study on [How Consumers and Experts Rate Credibility on the Web](http://www.consumerwebwatch.org/news/report3_credibilityresearch/stanfordPTL_abstract.htm): _The data showed that the average consumer paid far more attention to the superficial aspects of a site, such as visual cues, than to its content._

Hopefully, our new design will make Recipezaar more  credible. :-)
