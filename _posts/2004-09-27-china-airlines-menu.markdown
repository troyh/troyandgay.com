I can select the meals I want on our China Airlines flight _now_. And it looks good, especially for an airline. I can't believe I'm looking forward to an airline meal, but I've read good things about the food. I've also read that their "wine selection is good":http://www.airlinequality.com/main/review_45.htm -- on an airplane! Selecting your meal days before your flight sounds like a great service, but really, I can't tell you what I'll want for dinner tonight, much less on Wednesday.

Note the message at the bottom: "...have not used your computer for a while". I use it every day! :)

![](http://www.airlinemeals.net/images/meals/chinaairlines036.jpg) The "meal photos":http://www.airlinemeals.net/meals/ChinaAirlines021040.html of the Business class (what we're flying, hey, it's our honeymoon and this flight is 14 hours!) look better than most Seattle restaurants. Is that brandy in that glass???

And "the lounge":http://www.china-airlines.com/ch/area/vip.htm at the Taipei airport looks pretty sweet. Wi-Fi internet, noodle bar, plasma screens, shower facilities; sounds better than home. :)
