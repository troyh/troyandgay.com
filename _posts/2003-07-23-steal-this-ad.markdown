Ok, I might be a bit of an iPod-head, but these BuyMusic.com ads are not parody, they are simply trying to confuse the market.  They look like Apple Music ads, they use the same concept, look and font.  Knowing Apple, [they will undoubtedly sue](http://news.com.com/2100-1001-230273.html?legacy=cnet).  IMHO, there is a worthwhile copyright right suit here, though Apple would benefit from the ads if only their Windows version Music store were available.
