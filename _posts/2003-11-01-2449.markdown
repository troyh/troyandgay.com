Today's my birthday!

Last night, we went into downtown Vashon where all the local businesses give candy out the kids. I'm impressed at how much effort they put into making it a fun Halloween for the kids. And our friends at [Windermere Real Estate](http://www.windermerevashon.com/header.html) once again put on the best show with their "Tomb of Doom".

We went to the local pub for dinner with our Windermere friends Gary, Nancy, Heather, Larry and others. Everyone at the pub was dressed up in their costumes which was amazing given our small rural community. Nancy, who first heard about our engagement tonight, is ready to help plan the wedding. And that's good, because I am not looking forward to making decisions about flowers and other stuff women think is important.

I need to get to bed... too many beers and I'm sleepy...
