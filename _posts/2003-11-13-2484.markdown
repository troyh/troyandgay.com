T-Online, the online arm of Deutsche-Telekom, the German phone company, may [buy AOL](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/artikel/455/21434/)? ([Translation](http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/urltrurl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sueddeutsche.de%2Fwirtschaft%2Fartikel%2F455%2F21434%2F&lp=de_en&tt=url)). T-Online has half the subscribers as AOL, but is the #2 online service worldwide. Certainly they'd only buy them for the number of subscribers. So maybe this means the ["walled garden"](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid14_gci554703,00.html) that AOL users find themselves in would disappear? That'd be good for the internet.
