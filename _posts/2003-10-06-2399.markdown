We went to dinner at [Dahlia Lounge](http://www.tomdouglas.com/dahlia/index.html) (2nd time in 3 weeks) last night and met a bunch of people from [Recipezaar](http://recipezaar.com). It was a gathering of people from [Fine Cooking](http://finecooking.com)'s website from as far away as Germany and Australia, many of whom also split their time with Recipezaar. We met [Mean Chef](http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=32724), his wife Karen, [Tracy K](http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=32907), [PetitFour](http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=38532), [LLBunny](http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=59608).

Unfortunately, I forgot my camera. But I did snap some pics with the camera on my cell phone, but they look terrible in the low light of the restaurant.
