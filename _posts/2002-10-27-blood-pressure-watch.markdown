On Wednesday we went to Shoreline Community College for _free_ dental work. They took my blood pressure and, of course, it was high (152/67) due to my nervousness at 1) being in a medical environment and 2) having my blood pressure checked. So I've started taking it myself again in a more relaxed environment. It was 131/72 which is still a little high, but still normal. More weight loss and exercise should help.
