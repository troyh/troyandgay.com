My first Father's Day with Eva. Gay and the kids made me breakfast in bed, but I was already up and dressed by the time they got to the room. They made me a Bloody Mary with the [Bakon Vodka](http://www.bakonvodka.com/) that is so disgusting on its own that it can only be put in a Bloody Mary. I got an electric razor and [a book](http://www.amazon.com/Go-F-Sleep-Adam-Mansbach/dp/1617750255) to read to Eva, but it's a book that should be read to all of the kids.
