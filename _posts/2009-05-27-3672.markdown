Gay took the kids and went to Clerkenwell with Eric for the afternoon. I stayed at home and did some work for the first time on the trip, which is my form of relaxation. They walked around, took the kids to a playground and then went to dinner at another gastropub, [The Peasant](http://www.thepeasant.co.uk/).

Incidentally, it's pronounced "Clarkenwell" in the Queen's English. Nobody knows what you're talking about when you say it like it's spelled. Speaking of pronunciations, "Grosvenor" is pronounced "Grove-ner", "Leicester" is pronounced "Ly-ster", "Gloucester" is similarly pronounced "Gly-ster" and "Hertford" is pronounced "Hartford" (they really hate Es, I guess) -- even Mark, an American, didn't understand us when we said "Hertford". They must not tell UK kids to "sound it out" when learning to read.
