The last big cycling tour of the year starts today, the Vuelta de Espana (Tour of Spain).  We record it on TiVo and then can watch the day's stage in the evening as opposed to 6am when it happens live.  This means a careful cycling news embargo, otherwise we will find out what happened before we get to watch it.  Luckily, [our other site](http://www.mywireservice.com) makes this easy.  Just set up a filter for "vuelta" in the My Account page and all news that contains that word will be hidden from me.  I am so EXCITED!
