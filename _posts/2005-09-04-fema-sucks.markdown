Given it's pathetic work on the Hurricane Katrina tragedy, especially given that they had several days warning about it, it's obvious that [FEMA](http://www.fema.gov/) is not prepared for another terrorist attack in the US. I'm sure that terrorists are learning that they don't have to kill lots of people in one quick blow -- they just need to spread it out over a large area and our government can't do anything about it and more people will die over several days. 9/11 killed 3,000 people. [Hurricane Katrina's death toll will top that](http://www.voanews.com/english/2005-09-04-voa21.cfm), if it hasn't already.

[Michael Chertoff](http://www.dhs.gov/dhspublic/interapp/biography/biography_0116.xml) should be fired.
