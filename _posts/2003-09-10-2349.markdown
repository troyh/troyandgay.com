I haven't watched a horror movie in a long time, so fortunately, [The Ring](http://www.ring-themovie.com/) was a little better than the average horror movie, but not by much. Not much to say about it, people die of course through evil magic. But it was set in Seattle and some parts were even filmed in Seattle (most Seattle movies are filmed in Vancouver) and one scene included a ride on a ferry (the [Quinault](http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/your_wsf/our_fleet/index.cfm?vessel_id=54)).
