I took Hudson to the Huskies game today. He couldn't see when everyone stood up and was "overheating" in the sun. He made it to halftime before a bathroom break, a pretzel and a cupcake. We spent the 2nd half on the concourse in the shade. Huskies lost 20-13 but it was a close game.

After the game, Chloe came to babysit and Gay and I went out to dinner at [Terra Plata](http://terraplata.com/) before a great talk by [Robert Reich](http://robertreich.org/) at [Town Hall](http://www.townhallseattle.org/).
