On Friday, we went to [Books By The Way](http://www.booksbytheway.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp) and bought [ The Motley Fool's What to Do with Your Money Now: Ten Steps to Staying Up in a Down Market](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743233786/qid=1031503854/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_2/104-1143793-8062320?v=glance&s=books). We'll see how that changes our financial plans.
