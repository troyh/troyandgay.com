Troy pointed me to this [Michael Kinsley article in Slate](), and this is probably the most libertarian idea I've gotten behind in a while, but it makes a great deal of sense.  Now that _Lawerence v. Texas_ gets the government out of gay sex, undoubtedly (and ironically) folks will be soon arguing to bring the government into gay marriage.  Kinsley has another solution:
_to end the institution of marriage. Or rather (he hastens to clarify, Dear) the solution is to end the institution of government-sanctioned marriage. Or, framed to appeal to conservatives: End the government monopoly on marriage. Wait, I've got it: Privatize marriage._
Let people marry how they want, and let it mean nothing to the government.  Let questions of property and children be decided by commitments instead of paper.  Happens already...
