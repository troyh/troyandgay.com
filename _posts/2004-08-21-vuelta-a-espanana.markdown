The lineup for the "Vuelta is set":http://www.velonews.com/race/int/articles/6816.0.html.  All but 8 teams have a Spanish leader. It's a far cry from the Tour de France, where very few Frenchmen participate much less lead the teams. And surprising to me, Floyd Landis is not leading the US Postal team.
