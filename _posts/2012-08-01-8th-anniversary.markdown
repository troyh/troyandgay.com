Gay and I went to [Madison Park Conservatory](http://madisonparkconservatory.com/) for dinner to celebrate our 8th wedding anniversary. Nice summery night and good food. We had oysters and their pate with blueberry jelly for appetizers, I had the steak and Gay had the pork belly. For drinks, I had their Brooklyn 46, the first cocktail I've seen offered with Makers 46, and with dinner I had [Dogfish Head's Faithfull Ale](http://www.dogfish.com/brews-spirits/the-brews/occasional-rarities/faithfull-ale.htm).
