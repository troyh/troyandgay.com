I've increased my workouts this week by 50% and had a tough one this morning after just 4 hours of sleep. After 15 minutes, I bonked so I ate a handful of dried blueberries for energy. It helped, but I ended up stopping 3 more times to rest. It took me 2 hours to do a 1-hour workout. After showering, I made myself a grilled peanut butter and strawberry jelly sandwich, poured myself a homebrew and sat down to relax and read. I feel much better.
