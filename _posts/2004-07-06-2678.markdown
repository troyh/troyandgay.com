I've been trying and trying and trying to like the new [Wilco](http://www.wilcoworld.net/) album since their last one was so perfect. Today, for the first time, I finally started to enjoy it. I can't remember an album that took this long to grow on me. I intentionally stayed away from any reviews til I could get a handle on it. [Pitchfork Media]() is unimpressed; the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/folkcountry/reviews/wilco_ghost.shtml) likes it.
