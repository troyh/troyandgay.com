Eva is 4.5 today. Gay and I are both 45, or 10x older than Eva â€” we have each lived a decade for every year she has lived. There was no time when that has been true of any of our kids and, if my math is correct and none of us ever use [time dilation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation) by traveling in space, never will be true again.
