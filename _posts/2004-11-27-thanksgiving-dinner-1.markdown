We made three pies yesterday to bring to dinner last night at John & Deborah's:

[Rumrunner's Pecan Pie](http://www.recipezaar.com/72390)
[Praline-Pumpkine Pie](http://www.recipezaar.com/13888)
[Orange Crusted Pumpkin Pie with Bourbon Whipped Cream](http://www.recipezaar.com/45970)


John's mother, his brother and his family was there too. Dinner was delicious and there was plenty of wine, of course. We left at about 12:30am, after Gay had one too many scotches and danced the evening away with Deborah. :)
