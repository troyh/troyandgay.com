How do you know that Intelligent Design is not science? "George W. Bush understands it":http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/02/AR2005080201686.html.

If you want to see evidence that the US actually can make the correct decisions, and overwhelmingly so, in the courts, in public opinion and in education, watch "Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial":http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Judgment_Day_Intelligent_Design_on_Trial/70086394?trkid=226870. It'll restore your belief that America is not full of ignorant hillbillies.

Although for Seattle residents, you'll be embarrassed that a "think tank" on Intelligent Design, "the Discovery Institute":http://www.discovery.org, is headquartered in Seattle. Even the Catholic Church, hardly the bastion of scientific understanding, started accepting Evolution as far back as the 1950s -- 30 years _before_ they accepted that the Earth revolves around the Sun! Yet there are some Americans who believe don't believe in Evolution cuz da bible tells 'em so.
