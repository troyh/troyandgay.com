This makes a lot of sense. [:: Douglas Rushkoff - Weblog ::](http://www.rushkoff.com/blog.php): _It's fine to continue to protest the war. I'm against it, myself. But we must realize that those of us protesting are simply doing our part in the charade. By protesting the war as if it is real and inevitable, we add legitimacy to Bush's bluff._
