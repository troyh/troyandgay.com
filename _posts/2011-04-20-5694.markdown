They've installed the cabinetry in my closet. I haven't yet seen it in person but Mark texted me this morning about it and then Gay went to the house today and took this video of it.

I designed 2 pull-out cabinets to maximize the space I had (Gay got a much bigger closet than I did).  In the 4 feet of wall space, I could fit 12 linear feet of hanging space instead of of just 8 linear feet by turning the cabinets 90Â°, which requiring a pull-out hardware design. My closet has a window in it so these pull-outs also protect my clothes from the sun. The interior designers did me one better by throwing a pull-out mirror in between them! Gay says it's really nice and I can't wait to go see it.
