[God declared war on the US](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/ap/20040328/ap_on_re_mi_ea/israel_palestinians) and Israel, according to the new Hamas leader. According to Pat Robertson, though,  God wants Bush to win in 2004. Is God trying to create a war?!

When someone says that God told them something you agree with, that person is a spiritual leader. But if it's something you don't agree with, that person is a lunatic. Weird how that works. Kinda like everything: people only believe what they want to believe.
