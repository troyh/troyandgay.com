The internet "continues to rise in importance to Americans":http://news.com.com/Study%3A+Offline+still+beats+online+for+some+activities/2100-1025_3-5307538.html?part=rss&tag=5307538&subj=news.1025.5. 88% say it plays a role in their daily lives, 30% say it plays a "major role". But what are people looking for online? News? Music? Porn? Recipes? Nope. They want driving directions. :(  Weird, I think I've used the internet for driving directions 4 or 5 times in 8 years.

But really, why are we listening to polls to find out what people do on the internet? Can't computers tell us what people do online?? And would anyone even answer "Porn" when asked what they use the internet for?
