Gay went to Seattle yesterday and stayed overnight to help with a friend's baby shower. I stayed home with the dogs and had a pretty relaxing day (working, but fun & relaxing).

Had a delicious salmon dinner and some white wine. No movies tonight, two stages of the Giro d'Italia, _60 Minutes_ and _Sopranos_.
