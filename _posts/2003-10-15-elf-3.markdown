We [announced](http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=48759) that we are hiring our first employee at [Recipezaar](http://recipezaar.com)! After surviving the dot-com crash and working day & night (& weekends) to build and maintain the site for very little financial reward, it's gratifying to finally be able to hire someone to handle the day-to-day work it requires. We're very excited that we will finally be able to focus our attention on the part we're best at (software) and hand over the reins to someone who is perfectly-qualified to handle the part we're not good at. Years from now I believe we will look back at this as a pivotal event in our history.
