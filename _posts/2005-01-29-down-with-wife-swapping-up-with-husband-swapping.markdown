![bcta](http://troyandgay.com/pix/t49635oij78.jpg)After a string of real stinkers (we're still arguing about who put [Chasing Liberty](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chasing_liberty/) on our Blockbuster queue), we've resumed my "Alice's" film fest by seeing ["Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice"](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bob_and_carol_and_ted_and_alice/) (a follow up to ["Alice Doesn't Live Here Any More"](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/alice_doesnt_live_here_anymore/)).  Troy thought a wife-swapping (I say "husband-swapping") movie was in poor taste so soon after our own wedding, but the movie less about swinging,  than the emptiness in certain truth-telling in relationships, not just Bob & Carol's but also Carol & Alice's....  The most hilarious scene is the one with Ted & Alice in the bedroom trying to negotiate sex.  It would be difficult to put my finger on another movie that highlighted more clearly the difference between men and women.
