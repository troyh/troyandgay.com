A NYT [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/29/business/media/29FLIX.html?ex=1380168000&en=ec201c9a9400f866&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND) on Netflix ends, interestingly enough, with a comment from the founder & CEO of TiVo. Netflix & TiVo need to merge or partner so I can download movies to my TiVo that I rent through Netflix.
