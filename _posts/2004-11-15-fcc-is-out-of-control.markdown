We know that Michael Powell's FCC prefers to let the [few media corporations control all the media](http://www.gtlaw.com/pub/alerts/2003/brecherm_06.asp) in the US. And Jeff Jarvis just proved that the FCC, in general, allows the few to control what we see on TV -- [complaints from just three people](http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2004_11_15.html#008481) was enough to make the FCC levy a record $1.2 million fine against Fox. No wonder networks were afraid to show _Saving Private Ryan_ under this new FCC.
