Gay's dad is here visiting. Had red (strawberries), white (homemade whipped cream) and blue (blueberries) pancakes for breakfast. Worked out. Watched Tour de France while the kids played with Legos. Drank a beer. Barbecued burgers and ate dinner. Set off fireworks with the kids. Put the kids to bed. Watched the Seattle fireworks on TV. That was my relaxing 4th of July.
