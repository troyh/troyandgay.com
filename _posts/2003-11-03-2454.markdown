I love waking up in the morning to read [this](http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=50750):

_I just wanted to thank everyone at this site for helping me drop my husband's cholestrol level by 27 points in just 5 weeks. He just had surgery for blocked arteries in his neck and is on a strict no cholestrol diet. A friend pointed me to this site and since then my husband has enjoyed many new recipes and doesn't mind at all that they are low fat. Even found him some low fat brownies...his favorite. *L* well, thanks again folks....keep up the good work. _
