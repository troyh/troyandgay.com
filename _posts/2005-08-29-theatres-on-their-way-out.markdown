The days of "simultaneous release" for movies [is nearing](http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/business/national/12500564.htm), DVDs now are released within four months of the theatre release, sometimes sooner. Amazingly, it's not Hollywood that is upset about that prospect, but the theater owners. Poor, poor theatre-owners. Did you think you would have a business forever? Did you think people _liked_ buying a gallon of Coke for $5, sitting in uncomfortable chairs and have their feet stick to the floor? The only business that treats its customers worse is the airline industry.
