Well it has taken me til Thursday to report on the weekend.  Vashon Island's big festival celebrates strawberries -- which are no longer grown here.  We had a big barbecue Friday night with Jen, Nicki, Traci, Eric & Steve that culminated in peach cobbler and a midnight game of 12 o'Clock the Ghosts are Out.  Nothing like playing hide and seek in your front yard in your thirties.  Saturday morning I ran a 10k (95th out of 110!) and Traci & Eric ran the 5k.  Megan & Jon, Stephanie & Matt, and Mark & Lee joined us on the island for the parade, one of those cute rural America sort of things (antique tractors were the best part).  We worked the beer garden for hours and rode carnival rides.  It was a really, really fun time and a tradition I hope holds.  Though the raspberries were better if you ask me.
