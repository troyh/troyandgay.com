Well, he finally did it. The President of the United States has officially [endorsed discrimination](http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A1883-2004Feb24?language=printer)! Gay marriages aside, amending the U.S. Constitution to explicitly restrict personal freedoms and to codify religious ideals is everything the Constitution is against -- it's anti-American. George W. Bush is unfit to be an American. And to think there are Americans who criticize governments that push their views on their people. We are moving fast towards one of those types of governments. Sign the petition to [protect the Constitution](http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=13773).
