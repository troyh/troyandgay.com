Had dinner at John & Deborah's last  night. And played a game of Trivial Pursuit with their son, J.T., who teamed up with me to squash John, Deborah & Gay. Well, we won by one pie piece and J.T. took advantage of the wine they were drinking to give us a little help with more useful die rolling. But we won and that's what matters. :-)
