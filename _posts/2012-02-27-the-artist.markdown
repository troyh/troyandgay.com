There's no way "The Artist" is a good movie. Black and white and silent with a lousy score. They invented color and sound because movies without them sucked. That hasn't changed, but make a movie about how wonderful Hollywood is and Hollywood will reward you. 

Hey Scorsese, it turns out you don't need to put such effort into movies. Make a movie about Angelina Jolie's struggle with anorexia if you want an Oscar.
