This was a surprise. Gay found it our grocery store and thought of me. It's a Belgian Stout (I've never heard of such a thing) made with Belgian chocolate. It's not as cake-like as Old Rasputin or Stone's "Russian Imperial":http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/07/03/stone-imperial-russian-stout/ and it's very slightly sour, but has a nice chocolate flavor and a slight bitterness. I could drink several of these in a row, which is not usually true for me and stouts.

"Official site":http://www.ommegang.com/index.php?mcat=1&scat=7&ssnl=1. It's only rated a "B+ on BeerAdvocate":http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/42/38818 and a "3.6 on RateBeer":http://ratebeer.com/beer/ommegang-chocolate-indulgence/75815/. I'd give it an A- and at least a 4.0.
