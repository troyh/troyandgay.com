Wired News [talked with some guy](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,57754,00.html) who thinks he knows why [Google bought Blogger](/archives/2003/02/001223.php#001223). But that still doesn't make sense. Google didn't need Blogger to index [RSS](http://backend.userland.com/rss#whatIsRss) feeds.
