[Jonathan Ive on the design](http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,59381,00.html) of the [new PowerMac G5](http://www.apple.com/powermac/). I'm amazed by Apple's designs. In an industry that believes technical design is all that matters, it's fun to have a company like Apple that pays so much attention to things that matter to humans. Apple makes you want the things they make. The rest of the industry makes you pay for things begrudgingly.
