We, including Matthias, our general contractor, went to Olson Kundig's office for the 2nd straight day, this time to participate in their design critique session about our design. Not many firms do this but Jim Olson has been doing it for 50 years.

We got some good feedback and ideas. I think we can incorporate many of their ideas or they may lead us in a new direction. They really get the Optimism concept and had some cool ideas to incorporate it into the design â€“ elevating, upward motion, etc.  I appreciate how good designers can see things I can't see and/or can't express. It's fun working with talented people.
