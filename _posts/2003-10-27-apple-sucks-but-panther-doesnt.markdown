After [my earlier troubles](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/10/001772.php#001772) ([others have similar problems](http://discussions.info.apple.com/webx?50@@.599b3fd6) with the discs), I got Panther installed! No help from Apple, tho. Instead, my brother ripped his CD and I ftp'd it from him, burned a CD and could then install it. So I'm now running Panther and really like it! [Expos√©](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose/) is amazing!
