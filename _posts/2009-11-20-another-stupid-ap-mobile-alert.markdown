There is someone who works at the Associated Press, probably more than one!, that makes a decision about which news stories are important enough to be an alert for mobile users. And they decided that Oprah's imminent announcement to end her show in 2 years is worthy:

[![AP thinks this is critical news](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2475/4118700382_96135a13e5_o.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4118700382/)

I can't decide if this is dumber than their alert about [golf in the 2016 Olympics](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/10/09/ap-mobile-notifications/). Does this even merit an alert if you work for Oprah and will lose your job in 2011?

They accept (and seem to ignore) feedback at [mnnfeedback@ap.org](mailto:mnnfeedback@ap.org).
