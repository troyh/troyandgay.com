I don't know who is more stupid, [the kid](http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A64800-2003Aug29?language=printer) who made the Blaster-variant virus or the FBI that took a week to find him. He put the URL to his own web server in the code with a domain name registered to himself and he bragged about it on his web site ([Google cache](http://216.239.53.104/search?q=cache:FEZleHDR3mcJ:t33kid.com/hl=en&ie=UTF-8)) and the executable's name is his own nickname.
