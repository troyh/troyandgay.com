We haven't had a power outage in over a year, but last night at 7pm we had one for a little over an hour. When the power came back on, I discovered that the power supply was blown on one of our internal servers. I suspect it was because it was plugged into the [Belkin](http://www.belkin.com/) UPS and not the [APC](http://www.apcc.com/index.cfm) UPS. I'll never buy a [UPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply) that isn't APC again -- they're more expensive but worth it, IMO. The local [Vashon computer store](http://vashonpc.com) had a power supply so it's back up. I love commodity hardware!
