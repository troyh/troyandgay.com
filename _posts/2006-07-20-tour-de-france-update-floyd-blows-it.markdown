Floyd Landis, who got the yellow jersey, lost it and regained it lost it again in a _lousy_ performance. He lost 8 minutes on the final climb of the day yesterday while Carlos Sastre and Oscar Perreiro just flew up the mountain. Perreiro regained the yellow jersey and I can't see him losing 8 minutes today or in Saturday's time trial. There won't be any Americans on the podium this year, I don't think. Perreiro, Sastre and Menchov are the likely 1, 2 and 3.
How much a good team around you matters was demonstrated well by Floyd's Phonak team -- they disintegrated on almost every climb this year leaving Floyd all alone. You don't win a Tour de France without a strong team.
