We had a bunch of trees topped and removed on Saturday.  A couple near the house were so rotten, it is surprising they hadn't fallen on the house yet.  The 6 trees topped on the slope improved our view far more than expected.  Watching the guys climb the trees with chainsaws hanging from their belts, and tops the tress above them or swing between the trees..and then just these huge trees falling...as so scary, gay had to leave.  Well worth it, but seeing it was like watching a car crash.
