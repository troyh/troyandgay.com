"CNN":http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/19/robertson.bush.iraq/index.html: _The founder of the U.S. Christian Coalition said Tuesday he told President George W. Bush before the invasion of Iraq that he should prepare Americans for the likelihood of casualties, but the president told him, "We're not going to have any casualties."_

*Update:* The White House is "denying":http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/19/robertson.bush.iraq/index.html Bush ever said it and Pat Robertson stood by his statement. Pat Robertson has said  (and continues to say) some pretty odd things, but someone's lying. You can usually tell by asking yourself: Who has more to gain from lying?
