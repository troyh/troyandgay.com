The most philosophical sports interview I've ever heard:



<blockquote>Previously, I was scared to try something because I was always scared of failure. Once you believe and aren't scared of the outcome, things become a lot clearer and opportunities arise. </blockquote>



â€”Michael Rogers, 34, Stage 16 winner in the 2014 Tour de France, his first career TdF win of his career

Most of these interviews with stage winners are about what happened on the road, team tactics, etc.
