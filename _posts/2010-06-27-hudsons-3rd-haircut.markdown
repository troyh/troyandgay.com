Hudson was bitten by a bug, we think, yesterday on his left eye and it turned pink. He woke up Friday morning with a completely swollen eye. It was almost completely closed! Gay and grandma took him to the doctor on their way to his scheduled haircut and got an antibiotic and some kids' Claritin. It was much better by Saturday and practically back to normal by Sunday, thanks mostly to the Claritin. The doc said to stop giving him the antibiotic if it looks better.

The haircut was as bad as his eye. He used to have cool surfer-boy hair, but now looks like a dork. Good thing hair grows quickly.
