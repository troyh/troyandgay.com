"YOU ARE A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR A C*CKSUCKER AND A MOTHERF*CKING SON-OF-A-BITCH.Â  YOU ARE A GOOD EXAMPLE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD STRIVE TO RAISE THEIR LIKE.
C*CKSUCKING THIEF AND MOTHERF*CKING BASTARD. C*CKSUCKING THIEF AND MOTHERF*CKING BASTARD. C*CKSUCKING THIEF AND MOTHERF*CKING BASTARD."
This last sentence repeats for several pages in the selected bright red 32 point type(without any asterisks).  They are complaining because we've had to remove their account for abusive behavior towards other members, so their recipes now appear as posted by "Recipezaar" instead of their name.  What is really adorable about the note is that they became abusive because another member pointed out that a recipe this person had posted originally appeared on another website.  Awww, so sweet.
