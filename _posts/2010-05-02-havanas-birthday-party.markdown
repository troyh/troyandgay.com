We celebrated Havana's birthday today. We invited a bunch of her friends from her preschool and their parents, Jon & Megan and Steve & Renuka and their kids, Owen and Claire. We rented a bouncy house for the day which the kids loved and had snacks, cake, beer and wine. And the cake was delicious.

The slide in the house also got a lot of use by the kids and there was only one injury.

Jon, Megan, Steve, Renuka, Owen and Claire stayed late and the kids watched Pixar's _Cars_ quietly while we had dinner (that we ate after dessert!).
