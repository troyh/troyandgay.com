It took me a week, but I finally finished the garage handrail. While waiting for one piece to be welded by [Ballard Sheet Metal](http://www.ballardsheetmetal.com/), I finished the last bit of perforated aluminum sheeting on the walls and added some trim in the corners to finish it off.

On to the next project...
