We left early Thanksgiving morning for Florida.  Car > Ferry > Shuttle > Subway > Airplane > Monorail > Car we arrived at Troy's parents house 3,000 miles away 12 hours later. We had Thanksgiving dinner with Troy's mom, dad, aunt Lorna, brother and sister-in-law on Friday. Saturday we took a driving tour of the area (deftly avoiding the mall), bought a digital camera and then experienced the best of Ocalla dining and entertainment.  "The Villages" is a fully manufactured Southwest style shopping center and square.  With free entertainment every night in the square and 2-for-1 drinks, who's complaining?  That night we continued the party til 3a...  Sunday we just hung around the house and watched football.
