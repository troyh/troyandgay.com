We packed the kids in the car right after their midday naps and went to Newcastle, WA to Julie and Hans' house for [Gracelyn](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/07/20/gays-mom/)'s 1st birthday party. On the way home I resisted the [Fry's](http://www.frys.com/isp/renton.html) in Renton and we went to get takeout at [Buddha Ruksa](http://www.yelp.com/biz/buddha-ruksa-seattle) in West Seattle. I'm not sure why we did because we weren't very hungry after eating at the party, but we ate a little of it when we got home and left most of it for dinner tomorrow night.
