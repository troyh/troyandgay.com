The other beer I had this weekend was Deschutes' Hop Henge. I haven't read anything about this beer yet, but it tastes like a Double IPA that was also dry-hopped. The aroma is wonderful and it's got a nice bitter bite with a soft lingering bitter aftertaste. Another great great beer from Deschutes.
