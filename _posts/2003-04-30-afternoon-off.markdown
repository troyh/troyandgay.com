After our fourth outage in as many days as we scrambled to get Recipezaar's new hardware and new cache architecture working, we were about to throw in the towel we were so fed up.  Finally Troy discovered the dumb permissions problem causing this last error and Recipezaar was running again, but the owners hit the wall.  We took the afternoon off, took a nap, had dinner at an outside restaurant (see Troy's blog) and watched Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets -- review to come, the old kids fell asleep watching it.
