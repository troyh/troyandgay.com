Stumbled upon [an article about my favorite toy turning 65](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/lifestyle/183613_viewmaster.html?source=rss).  Didn't realize they were used for training in WWII; I'd love to see what those disks look like.  I have 6 or so viewers and a couple hundred slides.  My most prized possession is a view that has an internal light so you don't have to crane your neck to the lamp and can even look at them in the dark.
