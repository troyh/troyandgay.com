For no apparent reason, I stopped blogging.  It was a slow decline I guess, and then when I noticed it had been so long, I decided to make it an even month without a post.
Actually, it wasn't much of a vacation.  Frankly, I've been so dang busy there hasn't been much time to post.  Between going from a 3 person company back to a 2 person company, and trying to hire another 3rd person, I've had a tremendous amount of work.  Kathy's training officially ended today, so she is on the job and I'm breathing again.  Let's just hope that means I'll think of something worth blogging too...
