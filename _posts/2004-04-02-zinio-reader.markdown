Several months ago I was given a free subscription to [MacWorld](http://www.macworld.com/) magazine and was offered the regular print version or their new electronic version. Of course, I chose electronic. You read it with software from [Zinio](http://zinio.com/) which is impressive. It looks exactly like the print version (with ads too). You can zoom-in/out, click links, highlight and make annotations with relative ease. No copying & pasting though. The total experience is pretty close to reading a printed copy, complete with a visual effect of pages turning. I still can't sit on the couch and flip through the magazine, but other than that, this is the future of publishing.
