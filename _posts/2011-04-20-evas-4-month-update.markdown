Eva is 4 months old today. She is starting to grab and hold things, smiles more and giggles when her neck is tickled. She's not yet sleeping through the night regularly, although she's done it a couple times. But she's eating a lot and has some trouble napping during the day, so she must be on a growth spurt.

<!-- more -->Havana and Hudson still play with her, usually too roughly. Havana can gently put her pacifier back in her mouth when it falls out, which is handy. And Havana complains that Eva gets "all the tenshun". Every night Hudson gives good-night kisses and always says "Eva first!"

My mother still refuses to pronounce and spell her name correctly.
