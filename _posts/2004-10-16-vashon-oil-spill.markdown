They're [close to catching](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002064801_oilspill16m.html) the people who spilled the oil all over south Puget Sound and Vashon. One of the two suspects "has a history of pollution incidents". A few lawsuits will make the corporation be more careful next time.
