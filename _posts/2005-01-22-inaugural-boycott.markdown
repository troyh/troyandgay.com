In an effort to preserve our own sanity, we've instituted a voluntary 72 hour television boycott this week in an effort to prevent even a glimpse of a painful Bush sound bite.  As a result, we also missed the, I'm assuming, under-covered protests as well.  [Great photos here](http://centricle.com/photos/2005/01/21/) and [great signs](http://andiamnotlyingforreal.blogspot.com/2005/01/protest-sign-gallery.html) make me proud we have a country founded on free speech.  Four years seems like a mighty long time right now.
