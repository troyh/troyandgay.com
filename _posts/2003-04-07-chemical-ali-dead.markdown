Acccording to MSNBC, Ali Hassan Majid ("Chemical Ali"), Saddam's cousin, has just been confirmed dead by the British military in Basra. This guy was [vicious](http://www.hrw.org/press/2003/01/iraq0117.htm).

It's 12:30am and I'm going to sleep. The reports are that they are moving very rapidly through Baghdad at this point. I just may wake up and find that Baghdad has fallen.
