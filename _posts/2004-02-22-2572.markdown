We went to dinner last night with our friends John & Deborah. John and I always have interesting political discussions when we go down that road. It's funny how two people who want the same goals have such different opinions on how to accomplish those goals. Who's right? Probably both. In an election year with campaigns starting negative personal attacks, I wish more people would realize that neither side has evil intentions (grievous civil rights violations by the current administration aside).
