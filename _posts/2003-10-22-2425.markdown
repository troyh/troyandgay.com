I've been sitting on the couch tonight getting up-to-date on news via the web and listening to my music through TiVo on the TV. I already get the majority of my media over the internet. And while listening to KEXP over the internet, I just heard that musician [Elliott Smith](http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bio.asp?oid=4239&cf=4239) [ died today](http://www.sweetadeline.net/) at the age of 34 of [an apparent suicide](http://www.undercover.com.au/news/2003/20031022_elliottsmith.html).
