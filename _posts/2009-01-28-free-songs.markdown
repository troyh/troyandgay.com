You can download "The Rake's Song":http://links.emi.com/9j7u7q9kq2ol7o from "The Decemberists":http://decemberists.com/ new album due out March 24. You can watch the video (and see his face with too much white makeup) for [Morrissey](http://www.itsmorrisseysworld.com/)'s new single "[I'm Throwing My Arms Around Paris](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7_Nps1WhFQ)" from the album due out February 16. And you can listen to [U2](http://www.u2.com/)'s new single, "[Get On Your Boots](http://goyb.u2.com/)" (sounds a little like [Achtung Baby](<a href=)) from their new album due out March 3.

If the albums are done, why do I have to wait to buy them? Years ago it took time to manufacture the plastic discs, but not anymore. Why the artificial delay to start accepting money?!?
