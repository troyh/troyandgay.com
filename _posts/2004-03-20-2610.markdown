[Rumsfeld on 9/12](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/ap/20040320/ap_on_go_pr_wh/terrorism_adviser): _"Rumsfeld was saying we needed to bomb Iraq," Clarke said. "We all said, 'But no, no, al-Qaida is in Afghanistan." Rumsfeld complained that "there aren't any good targets in Afghanistan and there are lots of good targets in Iraq."_
