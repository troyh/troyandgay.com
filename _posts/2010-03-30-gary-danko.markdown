We didn't get a chance to go to [Gary Danko's restaurant](http://www.garydanko.com/) down the street from our hotel the last time couple times we were here, so we made it a priority this time. We got a babysitter for the kids and went early to get a seat at the bar since they require a 2-month reservation for a table.

We both got the tasting menu with changes so we could share and try more things. All the food was great, but the salmon wasn't the best I've ever had and the service could have been better -- we waited far too long for the entrees. This is the first time we've been to a super-foodie restaurant since Murano in London. It wasn't as good an experience as [we had at Murano](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/05/25/dinner-at-gordon-ramsays-murano/), which was perfect in every way, but we ate at the bar rather than at a table, which I presume is where the better servers work, and it also wasn't as expensive (although it was close).
