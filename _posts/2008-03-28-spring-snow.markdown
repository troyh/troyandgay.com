Crikey, a week into Spring and it's snowing!

It snowed on Wednesday evening, yesterday (followed by sun) and now today. It's supposed to snow tomorrow too. None of it has stuck but today's snow appears to be sticking now.

**1:30pm update:** Still snowing and we have about 1/4-inch of snow.

**3:30pm update:** Snow is gone and the sun is out. Just confirms the adage about Seattle weather: If you don't like the weather in Seattle, wait 15 minutes.
