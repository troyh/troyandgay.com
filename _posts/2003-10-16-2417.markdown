The FedEx delivery came back this morning and I talked to them (actually a woman). She said she didn't realize that the doorbell was a doorbell. It's a button, and the only button, next to the door. What else would it be?

And I still don't understand why my signature-on-file indicating my authorization to leave packages at the doorstep applies to FedEx Express but not to FedEx Ground. Why does the transportation type determine whether I want packages left at my doorstep?

It's a shame that it took just as long to travel the 600 miles from Sacramento to Seattle as it did to travel the 5 miles from Seattle to our house. But I got my package.
