A day after Intel reported poor earnings, [IBM](http://rss.com.com/2100-1001-962328.html?type=pt&part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news) and [Apple](http://rss.com.com/2100-1040-962325.html?type=pt&part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news) report poor earnings. If Microsoft reports good earnings tomorrow, something is rotten in Redmond.
