We drove to Long Beach for lunch at Beachwood BBQ, a well-regarded beer brewpub and beer bar. The food was great, the best food we've had on the trip and I'm not a big barbeque meat person. Then we drove to Placentia to The Bruery but we got there an hour-and-a-half before they can serve beer in their tasting room (which is a nice tasting room). So we just bought some bottles of beer they don't distribute to WA and drove up the road to Noble Ale Works, a recommended newer brewery. Their tasting room is much lower-rent but the beer wasn't bad. We left, got the kids some ice cream and sat in traffic until we got back home.

Note about the car culture: Because Southern CA is one big suburb, everything is 45 minutes away from everything else! I'm surprised that restaurants have restrooms in them -- I think Californians wouldn't mind getting in their cars and driving 45 minutes to use one. It's no wonder traffic is so heavy here. There's lots of sports cars even though you rarely get above 20 MPH on highways; it must be Californian wishful-thinking. If southern CA is any indication, Maserati is one of the top car-makers in the world. I've never seen so many Quattroportes not in an episode of Entourage.
