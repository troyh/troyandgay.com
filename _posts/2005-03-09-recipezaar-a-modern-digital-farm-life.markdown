A wonderful blog [interview with Brent and Sheila Simmons, makers of](http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000500.html) [NetNewsWire and MarsEdit](http://www.ranchero.com), and all around great folks, summarizes much of what Troy and I like about our home-based business making software.  They are asked, like we always are, how can you possibly be around each other 24/7 and work together too.  I just loved the way Brent answers:


<blockquote>We laugh at the same stuff and enjoy so many of the same things. We like being able to do things like take a walk around the neighborhood after lunch. We like being able to play with the cat [dogs in our case] whenever he wants.

It's a little bit like farm life -- but modern, urban, digital farm life. We grow software.</blockquote>
