Palin said that Alaska's proximity to Russia gives her foreign policy experience and she was laughed at because, well, it's an idiotic statement. Now Katie Couric asked her about it and she seemed to dismiss it as just a flippant comment that she's being made fun of over. Ok, that'd be smart, claim she was taken out of context and move on. But then goes on to defend it!:

(She's so eloquent and coherent, isn't she?)

Is she implying that Russia invades Alaska often? Or is she implying that they are about to? Does she realize that Russia is our ally? At least she doesn't seem to think she's protecting us from Canada.

I wish Couric had asked her if the governors of Washington, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas are all foreign policy experts too since they actually _touch_ other countries. Certainly in her teeny tiny brain they are.

Hell, I can see Puget Sound from my house. That makes me a marine biologist. I've seen lots and lots of numbers in my life, that makes me a mathematician... or an economist... or, why not, both! I've dropped things, that makes me a physicist. I used soap today, that makes me a chemist. I'm listening to music right now, I'm a musician.

When Sarah Palin's parents told her she can be anything she wants to be, she took them literally. She is dumb. No wonder Republicans think women are inferior, this is what they consider their best and brightest.
