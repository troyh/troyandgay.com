A few hiccups in the new caching mechanism, but they seem to be mostly ironed out now. But I was woken up by a squawking pager at 5am, at 6am and at 7am. Fortunately, it was nothing too serious and I had my laptop on the nightstand and could deal with stuff quickly without leaving bed. By 7am, I was up and by 10am had fixed a few bugs. And it's running really well so far.

Oh, and it is _FAST!!!_
