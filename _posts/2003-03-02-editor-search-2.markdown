When I used Windows I loved [TextPad](http://www.textpad.com), because it does everything I need for writing code and html for Recipezaar.  Since I've been on the Mac, I've been looking for a replacement.  [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml) Pro does what I need -- though not as elegantly as the simple TextPad -- but $150 seems like a lot to pay for an editor (the free Lite version does not do syntax highlighting).  [Update: BB just canceled the free Lite version and now sells the cheaper Text Wrangler, but that doesn do syntax highlighting either.]  I thought [Web Design](http://www.ragesw.com/webdesign.php) was the answer but despite Preferences which suggest you can set extensions for appropriate syntax highlighting, I can't get the darn thing to open any file with an extension other than html/xml/php.  [Update: I emailed the maker and got a response in 8 hours and an offer for a private build to fix my problem -- I love developers like that -- I might just have my answer.]  Troy uses vi, but I know [this much](http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/02/21/vi_intro.html) about vi, which is just good enough to get my cvs comments in and it drives me nuts.
