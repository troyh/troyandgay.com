We almost got kicked out of our local pub on Friday night with our friends Heather & Larry & Ron the accupressurist due to the drunk beligerance of another...well, Larry's tumble off of a bar stool onto the floor probably didn't impress the staff either, but we found it hilarious.  I sort of wish we had been 86-ed just because with the number of professional drinkers that frequent Bishop's it would have been quite a badge of honor.  Saturday Troy and I had an amazing 4 hour conversation about a business idea, well several actually -- it is stuff like that which reminds me that I have the smartest boyfriend in the world.  Followed by a fantastic dinner ([ribs](http://www.recipezaar.com/recipe/getrecipe.zsp?id=41889), [corn](http://www.recipezaar.com/recipe/getrecipe.zsp?id=14433), and [fresh cherry pie](http://www.recipezaar.com/search/getrecipe.zsp?id=64861) that did NOT set) with our friend Mark Weeks, catching up on his life and falling more in love with his boyfriend Lee, even though he is still in London.  Highlight: Mark had his laptop so we could see all of his recent photos.  What a great way to look at pictures!
