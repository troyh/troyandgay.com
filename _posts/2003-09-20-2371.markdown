This morning at 5:05am, our master load-balancer stopped being the master and the backup took over and then gave back control to the master. Two problems: 1) the master shouldn't have stopped and 2) the master should have taken control back when the backup gave it back. Fortunately, a quick restart of the keepalived daemon fixes it.

I checked the mailing list archives for the [load-balancing software](http://www.keepalived.org) and, of course, the problem was discovered this week and there's [lots of talk](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=3150459&forum_id=3211) about it. Hopefully, a fix will be made to it soon. Fortunately, it only happens every week or so.
