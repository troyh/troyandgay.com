We're late-comers to [Queer Eye for the Straight Guy](http://www.bravotv.com/Queer_Eye_for_the_Straight_Guy/), but we are loving it.  Unfortunately the Boise, Idaho, affiliate decided to not show the latest episode.  [Letters to the editor to the local paper](http://www.idahostatesman.com/Opinion/letters/story.asp?ID=45601&S=137) seem to make the point:  Is KTVB worried that Idahoans will finally learn that the mullet and fanny-pack are fashion no-noÂ´s? ... Tell me what mother would not like to see her son get a haircut, wear nice clothes and learn to cook a decent meal?
