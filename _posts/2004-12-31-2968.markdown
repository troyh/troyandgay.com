[U.S. ups tsunami aid from $35 million to $350 million](http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/12/31/us.aid/index.html): "The United States will increase its aid pledge from $35 million to $350 million to help victims of the tsunamis in south Asia, CNN has learned. The increase followed criticism that the initial amount was far from enough."



Criticizing the government works! This is great news. Now the US should work with the UN instead of compete with it.
