[![letour2003.gif](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/letour2003.gif)](http://letour.fr/) The Tour is getting amazingly close. Lance leads Ullrich by 15 seconds and Vinokourov by 18 seconds. If nothing happens tomorrow, the race will come down to the final stage, another time trial. And given that Ullrich crushed Lance by 1:36 in the first time trial, that's not good for Lance.
