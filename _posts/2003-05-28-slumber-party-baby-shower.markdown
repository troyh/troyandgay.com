Our friends Annie (& Noke) are having their second baby, and so [Stephanie](http://about.nordstrom.com/aboutus/investor/contact_info.asp) and I threw her a baby shower on Sunday.  I spent Saturday night at Steph's so we could shop, cook and generally dish before the party.  We even dyed each other's hair -- how's that for super-girlie?!  The brunch was very yummy, the baby got lots of adorable presents and Steph and I got to witness the chaos that children bring.  [Thoughts from my office door several years ago on this topic](http://www.cartoonbank.com/cartoon_closeup.asp?pf%5Fid=40163&dept%5Fid=1001&mscssid=WK820NJPPKME9JXPRM4LRRMLQ0WR2SDB&cartoon=1&s_keywords=baby%2Cclothes&findby=popular&s_artist=&s_id=&s_imageType=&color=&s_fromdate=&s_todate=&NewYorkerOnly=&s_topic=).
