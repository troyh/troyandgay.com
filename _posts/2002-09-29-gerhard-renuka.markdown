We went into Seattle (again) yesterday and over to the Eastside. Went to Crate & Barrel and bought a couple sets of glasses and then to Staples for (free) office supplies. Then to Gerhard & Tracy's housewarming party at their new house in Lakemont. Then we went to dinner at [Brasa](http://www.brasa.com/) with Renuka Abayanayaka -- he quit  and is leaving for Sri Lanka on Monday!
