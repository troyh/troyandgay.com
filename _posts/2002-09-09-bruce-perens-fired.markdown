In [Balancing Linux and Microsoft](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/09/technology/09SOFT.html), the NY Times says that Bruce Perens, a leading open source advocate, was fired by HP because HP/Compaq doesn't want to upset the almighty Microsoft. Looks like Microsoft is back to their old coercive tricks.
