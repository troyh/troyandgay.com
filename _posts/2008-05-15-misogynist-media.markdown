The Washington Post talks about "misogyny in the Democratic race":http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/14/AR2008051403090.html. It's sad that in 2008 women are still kept down and that it's acceptable. I imagine one day I'll have to explain to my daughter that it's good to be smart and ambitious. That's a talk I won't need to have with my son.
