We finally made it to Elysian's pumpkin beer festival this year.  I love pumpkin beers, it's one of my favorite styles so I've been looking forward to it since [I missed it again last year](http://troyandgay.com/2010/10/16/4514/). This year they had it at their new (huge) brewery in Georgetown and they sold tickets so we were guaranteed to get in. The place was packed, it was more of a Waiting In Line Festival that served beer. As soon as you got your beer you had to get back in another line to get your next one because the lines were so long and slow-moving. We got a lot of great beers that we wouldn't have been able to get otherwise, so it was worth it. And there weren't as many yokels just there to get drunk, which plague most beer festivals.

Mo worked Saturday and watched the kids so we could go. We used Uber to get there and back to avoid drinking and driving and met up with Jon and Megan. We all came back to our house for BBQ dinner.
