Once again, [Andrew Sullivan](http://www.andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2004_02_22_dish_archive.html#107768650195226154) has it right:

_It's the president who has to answer to the charge that in wartime, he chose to divide this country over the most profound symbol there can be: the Constitution itself. I refuse, in short, to be put in a position where I have to pick between a vital war and fundamental civil equality. The two are inextricable. They are the same war. And this time, the president has picked the wrong side. He will live to be ashamed that he did._
