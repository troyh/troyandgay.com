Ben was appropriately contrite after [his idiotic accident](http://troyandgay.com/?p=3190):


<blockquote>"I recognize that I have a responsibility to safeguard my health in the off-season so I can continue to lead our team effectively. I never meant any harm to others nor to break any laws. I was confident in my ability to ride a motorcycle and simply believed such an accident would not happen to me.

"If I ever ride again, it certainly will be with a helmet."</blockquote>


He didn't intend to break any laws, yeah, I guess, although the law was pretty clear that he was not licensed to ride without a helmet. [Cowher had wise words](http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06171/699570-66.stm) on Ben's stupidity:


<blockquote>"Sometimes with the lessons of life, you have to get knocked down before you get back up," he said.</blockquote>


But I won't be eating any [Roethlis-burgers](http://www.recipezaar.com/138858) until I'm sure he's ready to win another Super Bowl.
