Worldcom announced that their "accounting error" is [$3.3 billion worse](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2182201.stm) than previously reported, making the total a $7 billion lie. And.... they warn that there may be even more "errors" discovered. Crikey. I hope lots of people go to jail over this one.
