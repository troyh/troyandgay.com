![](http://troyandgay.com/pix/Picture6.png)![](http://troyandgay.com/pix/Picture7.png)This summer has been lacking in good new music, it's been so bad it's hard to even find a mediocre CD to buy. The only two good CDs I've heard in months are [Death Cab For Cutie](http://www.deathcabforcutie.com/)'s _Plans_ and the self-titled [Clap Your Hands Say Yeah!](http://clapyourhandssayyeah.com/shows.php), which was recommended by our hip New York friend, [Cindy](http://www.netomat.net/people/team.php) (who also got us into [Bloc Party](http://www.blocparty.com/go.php?object=home), which was our soundtrack through France in July).

I liked DCFC's _Transatlanticism_, but _Plans_ is even better -- not terribly innovative, just all-around good music. _Clap Your Hands Say Yeah!_ is a little like Talking Heads and generally reminds me of good 80s music.
