[![letour2003.gif](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/letour2003.gif)](http://letour.fr/)The US Postal Service destroyed the other teams today in the team time trial! A 30-second win, which is _huge_. And they beat ONCE, probably the best time trial team ever. The USPS has the top _eight_ places in the overall. Just incredible. I think Lance will take the yellow jersey on Sunday and will never give it up.
