Havana had her first dance recital tonight. She'd been going to rehearsal for a few weeks, something parents weren't allowed in to see. After about 45 minutes, Havana made her debut.

We had to leave at intermission so Gay could drop me off at Reid's bachelor party at his dad's cabin on the island. There I saw some Jon, Mark, Peter and Reid's brother who I hadn't seen in a long time as well as Mark and Reid, of course. I was late but they saved me the biggest steak I've ever seen, that was perfectly-cooked.
