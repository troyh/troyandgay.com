[Roethlisberger in surgery after serious motorcycle crash](http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06163/697655-100.stm). I hope he recovers and it looks like he will, but crikey, what a lucky idiot. He's 24 and on his way to be one of the NFL's greatest players in history and he risks it so he can ride his motorcycle without a helmet. NFL Radio played a year-old interview with Ben about riding without a helmet where the reporter said "But you wouldn't play football without a helmet" and he replied that he wears a helmet in the NFL because the NFL says you have to wear a helmet. So would he not wear a helmet if the NFL said he didn't have to? He's certainly not the brightest guy in the world.
