![IMG_2353.jpg](http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2353.jpg)We just got a Christmas present from Google ([Recipezaar](http://recipezaar.com) runs Google ads). It's an AM/FM radio/mood light. And it changes function depending on how you place it. On one side, it's a radio only, turn it and it's a mood light only, turn again and it's both a radio and a mood light and the fourth side turns it off. The mood light slowly fades between red, blue, green and purple. Cute.

The card says "Happy Holidays" in several languages. Last year, I think we just got a card. They must like us better this year. :)
