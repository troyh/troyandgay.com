Salon did [an article](http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/05/29/tax_cuts/) listing the things that the $330 billion tax cut Bush just signed into law would have bought instead. The list includes providing health care for the 41.2 million Americans who don't have health care, hired 100,000 teachers and provided aid to 6,000 schools and tutoring for 9 million low-income children, and countless other causes more worthy than giving the average citizen a couple hundred bucks or wealthy people even more money than they need. Gotta love the wisdom of government.
