I'm finally [trying to sell](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=29520&item=2308308580&rd=1) the Honda generator that came with the house on eBay. eBay a money-printing machine... they charge $2 just to add a <b> tag to your item in the list. No wonder they're a billion-dollar company.
