We just made some significant changes to "Recipezaar":http://recipezaar.com and we've run into some amazing IE6 bugs. There's at least 3 bugs in the way it handles cookies, most notably it doesn't even properly understand the timezone it's in so people on the east coast think any cookie that expires within 3 hours of our time is in the past (and IE always thinks it's in the timezone it was installed in). Then there's the "SSLv3 bug":http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;%5bLN%5d;305217. Amazing that this browser can be so popular yet so broken. And I'm not even talking about how bad it is at CSS!
