<blockquote>“The goal of the future is full unemployment, so we can play. That’s why we have to destroy the present politico-economic system.” This may sound like the pronouncement of some bong-smoking anarchist, but it was actually Arthur C. Clarke, who found time between scuba diving and pinball games to write “Childhood’s End” and think up communications satellites.

The current politico-economic system doesn't need to be destroyed, it needs to be encouraged – Capitalism's goal is 100% unemployment.



<blockquote>The Puritans turned work into a virtue, evidently forgetting that God invented it as a punishment.</blockquote>



Religion seems to always be hypocritical, short-sighted and misguided.



<blockquote>...I’ve always understood that the best investment of my limited time on earth was to spend it with people I love. I suppose it’s possible I’ll lie on my deathbed regretting that I didn’t work harder and say everything I had to say, but I think what I’ll really wish is that I could have one more beer with Chris, another long talk with Megan, one last good hard laugh with Boyd. Life is too short to be busy.
