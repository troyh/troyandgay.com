I got my suit for the wedding yesterday. And a tie too. Then we went to [Fox Sports Grill](http://seattle.citysearch.com/profile/39594290?cslink=roundup_name_noncust&ulink=roundup__roundupentity2-1_1__0_profile_2_1) for dinner with friends. I had a good hamburger and we watched US Postal win the team time trial on the big screens.
