I finally got around to trying to build an iPhone app. I had to learn Objective-C so I spent Sunday reading _Programming in Objective-C 2.0_ (for "free" on "Safari Books Online":http://my.safaribooksonline.com/, that service pays for itself many times over!) and today I launched XCode and had the beginnings of the app done. Apple could make it easier to learn and XCode could stand a lot of improvement, but two days to get something basic accomplished in a new language and on a new platform is not terrible.

Once you get over the hurdle of understanding the concepts and idioms of the iPhone SDK (probably a lot easier if you're a Mac developer, which I'm not) it starts to go quicker. The SDK docs are pretty good and have good examples. Objective-C is a much simpler language than C++, which is a good thing, but it also does a lot of things differently for no good reason that I can see.
