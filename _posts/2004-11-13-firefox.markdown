[](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&id=0&t=45)After several attempts in the last few months, I've finally switched to "Firefox":http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/index.html as my default browser and I like it! It's easier to access the tabs (Cmd+1 for tab 1, Cmd+2 for tab 2, etc.), other apps open windows in new tabs so less clutter on my screen, it's fast, smooth-scrolling, popup-blocking and my favorite feature, I can add any search engine to the Search box (Safari only allowed Google). Other niceties include easy searching on the page (just start typing) and it doesn't let me mistakenly close the window and all tabs when I really just wanted to close the one tab. And, for web developers, the "web developer toolbar":http://www.chrispederick.com/work/firefox/webdeveloper/ is amazing.

My only complaint is that the fonts are bigger than they are on Safari, and there's no preference to change it.
