Gay's brother is getting married this tomorrow in Spokane. We took the 9am ferry, stopped at [Meta Marble](http://www.metamarbleandgranite.com/) to look at some marble samples that the designers like and then we went to the house to check on the progress (after another stop at Top Pot Doughnuts). The master bedroom/bathroom framing is basically done, the kids' bathroom wall is framed and a new header has been put in place, one of the walls in a kids' room is re-framed because a door was moving and the plumbers upgraded the 3/4" water line from the street with a 1 1/4" pipe.
