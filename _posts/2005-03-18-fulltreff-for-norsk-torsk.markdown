A Norwegian fish newspaper, [Fiskaren](http://fiskaren.intrafish.no/), published an article on Recipezaar, apparently because of our cod recipes (not because I'm half-Norwegian). It's in Norwegian, of course, so we don't know what it says. Can anyone read Norwegian and translate the gist of it? Let us know and we'll send you the article (it's a PDF).
