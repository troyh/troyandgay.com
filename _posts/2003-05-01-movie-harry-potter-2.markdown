After dinner, we came home and finished watching Harry Potter 2. As with the first movie, it was well-made, the cinematography and special effects were very good and was entertaining throughout the almost 2.5 hours. But again like the first movie, it's definitely a kids' movie. The characters are a little too shallow and the storyline is very simple with a happy ending. It's a "thinking kids' movie", but a kids' move nonetheless.
