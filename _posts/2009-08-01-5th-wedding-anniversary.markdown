We were married 5 years ago today. We went to [Dahlia Lounge](http://www.tomdouglas.com/restaurants/dahlia-lounge), the place we went [the night we got engaged](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2003/09/14/putting-a-ring-around-the-and/), for a great dinner. Then we took a nice drive around the beach at [Alki](http://images.google.com/images?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=alki+beach&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=M7F0Sua5F4iIsgP28czHCA&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=4) before coming home.

Thank you to those who sent us cards, if only we knew your wedding anniversaries!
