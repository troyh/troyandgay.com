[Microsoft denies](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/163536_msftsco07.html) they are funding [SCO's lawsuits against linux](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2004/03/001923.php#001923). Good news, but Microsoft has a tendency to lie in their denials, specifically the recent (but considerably less significant) [iLoo](http://www.toiletmuseum.com/iloo.html) and their [faked "Switch story"](http://www.macmerc.com/article.php?sid=374). I'm sure the truth will be revealed eventually.

**Update:** There are now reports that the SEC is investigating Microsoft and SCO for "under-the-table" financial dealings.
