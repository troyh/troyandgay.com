![ouzo.jpg](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/ouzo.jpg)I may as well put a picture up of our other dog, Ouzo. Both dogs are named after beverages for some reason. Ouzo's a "licker". Get it? Yeah, it really is that funny. Ouzo's fine today, had a little ball-playing in the yard as he loves (and I mean loves) to fetch. He fetches to the point of obsessiveness. He just doesn't stop. Ever.
