This is priceless. Republican strategist Mike Murphy and Republican mouthpiece Peggy Noonan say what they really think about Sarah Palin when they think they're not on camera:

Transcript:


<blockquote>Mike Murphy: ...Because I come from a blue swing state governor world, you know, Angler, Whitman, Tommy Thompson, Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush, and these guys... this is all like, how do you want to pick this race (?)... just run it up. And, it's not gonna work.

Peggy Noonan: It's over.

Mike Murphy: Still, McCain can give a version of Lieberman's speech and do himself some good.

Chuck Todd: The Palin pick is insulting to Kay Bailey Hutchison

Peggy Noonan: I saw Kaye this morning

Mike Murphy:  Yeah she's never gonna feel comfortable about this. They're all bummed out

Chuck Todd: I mean, is she really the most qualified woman?

Peggy Noonan: The most qualified? No. I think the went for this, excuse me, political bullshit, about narratives...

Chuck Todd: Yeah, but what's the narrative?

Peggy Noonan: Every time the Republicans do that, because that's not where they live, and it's not what they're good at, and they blow it.

Mike Murphy: You know what's really the worst thing about it? The greatest of McCain is no cynicism, and this is cynical, and it's gimmicky.</blockquote>



This ticket is creating one of the few litmus tests in politics: if you ever hear someone admit they voted for McCain/Palin, you can safely write them off as a gullible idiot.
