So the term "October Surprise" was "invented by Republicans in 1980":http://slate.com/id/2108884/ to pre-empt something that never happened. What is it with Republicans and preemption? Why are they so scared of the future? Why do we still talk about an October Surprise? Why do I ask so many rhetorical questions today?
