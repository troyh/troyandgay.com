It sure feels like they're closing in on bin Laden. <strike>They've now [captured](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&ncid=578&e=2&cid=578&u=/nm/20030307/ts_nm/attack_qaeda_dc) 2 of his (50?) sons and killed other Al-Qaeda dorks.</strike> I bet they kill or capture bin Laden this month. But I hope they capture him and we can see pathetic pictures of him like we did his buddy.

**Update:** I guess they didn't really capture 2 of his sons. How do these rumors get started??
