_Smart Money_ magazine has an article called "10 Things Celebrity Chefs Won't Tell You":http://www.smartmoney.com/10things/index.cfm?story=april2008-celebrity-chefs and mentions Recipezaar:

bq. Indeed, free recipe-sharing sites like Recipezaar.com, which offers 271,000 recipes ... also threaten to make your favorite chef's cookbook virtually obsolete.

I wonder if they realize that Scripps, aka The Food Network with all their celebrity chefs, owns Recipezaar. :)  And their count is off, Recipezaar now has "286,000":http://www.recipezaar.com/recipes/ recipes.
