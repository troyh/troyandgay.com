Another mention of [MyWireService](http://mywireservice.com), but it's in German. A somewhat understandable [translation](http://ets.freetranslation.com/): _Another Online Aggregator: MyWireService.  It become not I once at the weekend austesten (if it is too warm).  Steve in any case already relatively is enthused therefrom. netbib readers know in the mean time, what RSS and Aggregatoren are, if not: RSS kurzgefasst and the already mentioned side of what RSS of Alp UÃ§kan is._

And a good point was made on a comment to [a previous mention](http://www.librarystuff.net/new_archives/000618.html): _Cool link, cheers. I think web aggregator people often forget that one of the most useful places to have an aggregator is at work, and just about no-one can install software in those environments. Working in the media, aggregators could be incredibly useful to provide alternative news sources to the wires._
