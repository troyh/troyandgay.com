I love the Fall. I'm sitting on the back patio surrounded by fallen leaves and yellow trees, wearing a very warm wool sweater, a cup of tea (tea from our friend who lives in Sri Lanka) and doing [geeky stuff](http://ee-staff.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/) on the laptop. The dogs love to sit outside too, in the flower beds ruining the plants. Gay's inside still sick.

Update: back inside. Crikey, it's cold out.
