I've been cycling on a more regular schedule than any time that I've lived in Seattle. But I can feel my age now.... when I was 25 I could feel myself getting stronger at least once a week. At 33 years old, I feel like my leg strength has stagnated; the same hills tire my legs out the same everyday. I hate to think what it'll be like at 40.
