According to an [MSNBC poll](), "Forty-nine percent of registered voters chose Kerry, compared to 46 percent who re-elected Bush." It'd be interesting if Kerry runs against Bush given that both were in the [Skulls & Bones](http://www.antonysutton.com/) at Yale at the same time (and apparently didn't like each other). There are [some who believe](http://www.freedomdomain.com/skullbones.html) that the US Presidents, among other positions of power, are chosen from this secret fraternity.
