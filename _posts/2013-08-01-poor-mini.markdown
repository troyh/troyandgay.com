Several weeks ago, just a few weeks after [we got it](http://troyandgay.com/2013/05/23/mini-countryman/), Gay broke the Mini when she opened her door in a residential neighborhood and a car ran right into the door, bending it forward. Only the Mini and the other car were hurt, fortunately. 

It's been in the repair shop ever since waiting on a special tool, called a [Celette](http://www.celette-uk.co.uk/), that BMW requires to repair damage to the frame. We still don't know when it will be done.
