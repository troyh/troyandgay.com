Business 2.0 has an article about [What eBay Isn't Telling You](http://www.business2.com/articles/mag/print/0,1643,42194,00.html) about scammers. eBay wisely has a team of investigators for fraud, but apparently, the problem is pretty big (and covered up). And there's little that can reallly be done about. If eBay gets a brand of scammers, it's doomed.
