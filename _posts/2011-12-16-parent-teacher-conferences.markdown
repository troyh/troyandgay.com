We had our _first-ever_ parent-teacher conferences. Hudson's was on November 29 and Havana's was on December 2. Hudson's was delayed and then cut short, so we rescheduled it for today. Both kids are doing great. Hudson was hard to get to wash his hands in the morning and didn't always clean up when asked, so we got some advice from his teacher and that really helped -- she is amazed at how much better he's gotten and how much happier he is that he's learning his boundaries. Havana does very well, is very creative and loves art projects, and plays with all the kids.Â We talked about schools for next year for both of them and got some good information.
