We met Tom Kundig at the brewery building so he could see it. It was either meet him there today or wait until Christmas when he's back from trips to Asia and the sellers made arrangements to get us into it over the holiday weekend. Tom always has ideas and useful feedback and, as usual, is "super-jazzed" about the project which is part of the fun of working with him. Next week we can really start working on it with the architects and engineers. It's about time!

Hudson even went with us. Then he helped us pick out a Christmas tree so we have a tree up for our first holiday party tomorrow. We got an 8-foot tree and one of the nicest we've had in years â€” it's good to do it first thing after Thanksgiving.
