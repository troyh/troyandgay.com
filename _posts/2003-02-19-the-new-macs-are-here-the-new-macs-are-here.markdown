Surprise! The Macs [we ordered](/archives/2003/02/001221.php#001221) FedEx 3-day got here in 1 day! We were even planning to run errands in Seattle today so we would've missed the FedEx man; but luckily, we postponed that until Wednesday. Anyway, I've put pics up at [my (temporary) .mac site](http://homepage.mac.com/troyh3/). The Quicksilver PowerMacs look even better than I remember them. They're _very_ silver.... I thought our old PowerMac was silver but it's more bluish. And these things are _fast_!!
