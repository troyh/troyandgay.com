I ordered [Tiger](http://www.apple.com/macosx/), the 5-license Family Pack of course, through Amazon weeks ago, but won't get it til next week. But the reviews from [CNN.com ](http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/ptech/04/28/mac.tiger.ap/index.html?section=cnn_tech) and a very detailed one from [ArsTechnica](http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10.4.ars/1) are very positive. I've never been one to get excited about OS releases, at least not til I started using a Mac, but I can't wait! :)
