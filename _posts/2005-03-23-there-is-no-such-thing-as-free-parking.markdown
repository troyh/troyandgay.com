One of my biggest pet peeves is having to pay for parking.  As Troy can attest, I am a master at finding a free space rather than having to pay.  It is a stupid principal for a liberal to cling to, especially after reading how [we spend more on creating free parking than we do on Medicare in this country](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/216997_parking22.html).  As of right now, I am relinquishing my need for free.  The more we pay, the more attractive paid parking becomes and the market will take over. 

<blockquote>For example, cities typically require the construction of four off-street parking spaces for every 1,000 square feet of office space, Shoup said. Since each parking space takes up about 300 square feet, the net result is 20 percent more space for cars than people, he said. Parking requirements reduce the land available for housing and drive up the cost of housing, Shoup said. </blockquote>
