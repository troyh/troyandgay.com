![](http://textamerica.com/mlogs/IMG_4875/Thumb/IMG0814153733421.jpg)So I found out about the east coast blackout almost immediately from MyWireService.

![](http://textamerica.com/mlogs/IMG_4875/Thumb/IMG0814144403953.jpg)Everyone knows how fast stuff spreads on the web and all that but [this site](http://blackout.textamerica.com) allows anyone to post pictures of the blackout via email (they dumbly call them "moblogs").  I don't get how textamerica lets people do this for free...but whatever, it is cool.
