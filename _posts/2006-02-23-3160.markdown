Nine times these lines rhyme in lyrics [Beth Orton](http://bethorton.astralwerks.com/) is sportin':



<blockquote>Chickens don't fly
But they've got the wings
No matter how hard they try
They bump into things

They're all running around
With their heads on the ground
They got a wish bone
Where their back bone
should have grown </blockquote>
