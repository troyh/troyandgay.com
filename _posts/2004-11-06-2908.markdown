"Lance still hinting":http://www.velonews.com/race/int/articles/7174.0.html that he won't ride in the Tour next year. I've gotta believe that part of it is because of the French press who has hounded him for years. But I can't imagine that the Discovery Channel, his new sponsor, will not want him to ride in the biggest race of the season. And he certainly wouldn't screw up our plans to go to France next year to see him win his 7th Tour!
