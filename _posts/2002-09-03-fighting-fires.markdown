Another day of fighting fires: woke up and some idiot at alcatel.com is using WebCopier to archive the entire site; blocked him. Then memphis is completely maxed out handling a humoungous mail from cron on newyork after running the trigger/handler code. For some reason, apache on berlin simply stopped working and had to be restarted.
