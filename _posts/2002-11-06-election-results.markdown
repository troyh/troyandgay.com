We took the dogs for a walk after lunch and went to vote this afternoon.

At 11pm, Republicans maintain control of Congress. Probably means Bush will be unelected in 2004 cuz he won't fix the economy and can't blame the Democrats. Locally, R-51 lost (good) and I-776 lost (good) which are both pro-Monorail in a way. Oddly, the monorail initiative is "too close to call" as of 11pm at 51% to 49% with 25% of the votes in.

At 11:25pm, the Monorail is winning!: 52% to 48%.
