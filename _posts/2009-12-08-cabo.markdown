It's hot in the morning in Cabo.

I discovered that I forgot to pack shorts so we went to a shopping mall in the town of Cabo to see if I could find some. The mall was big but very empty of both people and stores. We did find a Nautica store and got a couple shorts. I'm glad we found them because my other option was to get shorts at Costco or Wal-Mart.
