[Vashon Island](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/pacificnw/2003/0420/cover.html), described by activist Rita Schenck as "one-third artists, one-third environmentalists and one-third lawyers."  I guess that makes us lawyers.  Cover story of this week's Pacific Northwest Magazine talks about Vashon's efforts to be self-sustaining.  There's evena guy here who makes his own bio-diesel fuel by recycling oil from deep-fryers -- "his exhaust smells like french fries" and his operations recently burnt down.
