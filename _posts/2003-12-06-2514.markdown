I'm inclined to believe that hindsight makes the Bush Administration appear incompetent, but that they didn't have any specific foresight about 9/11. But [this collection](http://www.buzzflash.com/perspectives/911bush.html) of articles is scary stuff. At the very least, airport security should have been tightened since they were apparently well-aware a hijacking would take place.
