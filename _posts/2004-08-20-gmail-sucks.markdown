I was invited to create a Google Mail account several weeks ago. So I created it. I haven't been able to login since. I tried to get my password reset by answering my "secret question" but it claims my answer is wrong! I don't know the name of my dog???  Gmail is seriously broken, so don't ever forget your password.

Finally got in and then this:

*Server Error*

Gmail is temporarily unavailable. Cross your fingers and try again in a few minutes. We're sorry for the inconvenience.
