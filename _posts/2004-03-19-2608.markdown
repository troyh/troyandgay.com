The ARIA, the Australian equivalent of the RIAA, [reports](http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/03/18/1079199330947.html) that music sales are up to an all-time high, profits are up and prices are down. The industry is prospering and consumers are paying less. Who's the loser in the file-sharing era? CD single sales are down, which is good, because those things are a rip-off anyway and singles (really just advertisements) should be downloaded for free.

Speaking of this, I bought 3 Pepsis yesterday since the [iTunes giveaway](http://www.apple.com/itunes/pepsi/) promises 1 in 3 will win. I opened the first one and I'm a winner! And it seems that Pepsi fixed the [cheat](http://www.macmerc.com/news/archives/1270), because I couldn't tell in the store which ones were winners.
