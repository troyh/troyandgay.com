The war is finally over, Blu-ray won. Congratulations, Sony. But plastic discs are temporary, movies will be downloaded. We can already do it today, we just have to buy a proprietary device ("Apple TV":http://apple.com/appletv, "Vudu":http://www.vudu.com/, etc.) or use a computer connected to a TV. The next war will be between online services. The factors involved in this war will be the cost of the device, selection of movies, convenience and ease-of-use. I'd bet on Apple TV, Apple excels in all of those areas except hardware pricing, but they continue to prove that people value money less than the other three. And "they are successful":http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/02/26/itunes-is-2-people-like-plastic-discs-less/ in their online music service, so they have the experience.
