Grandaddy's [Sumday](http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/reviews/story/0,11712,971099,00.html) is the most pleasantly fun album I've heard in a long time.

The line _"The supervisor guy turns off the factory lights so the robots have to work in the dark"_ reminds me of [GM](http://gm.com)'s 1980s mission to replace factory workers with robots so they, among other things, could save money on electricity in the factories.
