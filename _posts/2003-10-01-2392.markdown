I got my [Bluetooth](http://www.bluetooth.com/) [adapter](http://www.dlink.com/products/?model=DBT-120) to connect my computer to my cell phone today. It works. It's funny.... the instruction manual had seven pages of instructions for installing it on a Windows computer, lots of diagrams and lots of "Click Next" and "Click Yes" guiding you through installing software, giving Windows the path to the new drivers for the device, etc.

The instructions for the Macintosh was 1 sentence that said: "Simply insert the D-Link DBT-120 BluetoothÂ™ USB Adapter into an available USB port on your Macintosh OS X v10.2 and the installation will proceed automatically". I remember when Microsoft's marketing slogan was "Microsoft: Making It Easier"; not "easy", but "easier".
