It sounds like bad news, but could actually be good for us. [The Seattle Times: Local News: Passenger-only ferries may end](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/134598956_ferry19m.html): _Thorne said he also wants to look at moving the Vashon Island and Southworth traffic from Fauntleroy in West Seattle to downtown Seattle.

He has suggested everything from remodeling Colman Dock and installing restaurants and shops to putting  service on the ferries._
