I've always thought that software companies were living on borrowed times by being protected from lawsuits due to defects in their products. Now, a South Korean group [is suing](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,1054790,00.asp) Microsoft for the SQL Slammer virus. This was a bad one across Asia and even impacted Recipezaar due to other servers on the subnetwork we're on using MS SQL Server. I think the biggest effect on software in the next decade will be retraction of the EULA agreements we all agree to when we open the package. If Ford can be sued for damages in their defective products, why can't a software company?
