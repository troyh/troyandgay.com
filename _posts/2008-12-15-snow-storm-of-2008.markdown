It started snowing Saturday night while we were at Megan & Jon's Christmas Party. We left at 9:30pm and ran into some slick roads on Vashon when we got home.

We got about 1.5 inches. It was in the 20s all day Sunday and the forecast is for 20s all week and even more snow on Wednesday. It's rarely this cold in Seattle so it's fun for a little while, but it reminds me too much of the East Coast weather.
