Another Tour de France is over. Contador wins, Andy Schleck is second and Armstrong is third. Contador has won two Tours de France and the Vuelta Espana and the Giro d'Italia -- he's won all four major stage races that he's raced. Very impressive.

We went to France in 2005 to see what I thought would be Lance's last time on the podium, but there he is up there again in 2009. He's the second-oldest person to ever be on the podium. As it has been for the last 15 (!) years I've been watching, Phil Liggett and Paul Sherwen were who I looked forward to listening to for several hours every evening. I miss them already.

Lance has already announced he'll race the TdF again next year for Team Radio Shack and I suspect Bruyneel and most of the Astana teamÂ will be on that team too. In spite of his victory, Contador may have a hard time finding a new team next year -- no team director wants to deal with a guy who disobeys him and Contador will likely discover why having your team not think you're an ass is beneficial in a stage race. He's a very good cyclist and could win a few more TdFs if he can mature over the off-season.

My prediction for the winner next year is Andy Schleck.

Time for football season to start...
