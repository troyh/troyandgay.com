AOL (remember them?) is [working on Mystro TV](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/10/technology/10AOL.html), a competitor to TiVo. It sounds cool in some ways, but of course, being built by a media company, is designed to prevent commercial skipping, to even add more commercials (!), to prevent time-shifting for some programs, etc. It's a guaranteed failure for those reasons alone. And I like that the big companies are finally realizing that TiVo is  a great example of [disruptive technology](http://www.wordspy.com/words/disruptivetechnology.asp).
