After almost 11 years with my loved [Aeron](http://www.hermanmiller.com/Products/Aeron-Chairs) chair, I couldn't resist the annual Herman Miller sale so I bought [their attempt to better their Aeron](http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/29/technology/herman_miller.fortune/), the [Embody](http://www.hermanmiller.com/Products/Embody-Chairs). Delivery took 4 weeks and it arrived today.

The Aeron is so comfortable that I trusted the designers enough with the Embody that I bought it without ever sitting in it. Still, I was skeptical that they could have improved that much on the Aeron. They did it. The Embody is [more adjustable](http://hermanmiller.com/Adjusting-Embody), even easier to adjust, especially in the arms, has a more comfortable back, has an adjustable seat length to support my legs all the way to my knees and is just a little more firm. I'm still not decided on whether the material is better than the airy Aeron material but time will tell.
