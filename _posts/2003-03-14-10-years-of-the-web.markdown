[10 years ago today](http://slashdot.org/articles/03/03/14/1534218.shtml?tid=95) the first web browser, [NCSA](http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/)'s [Mosaic](http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Divisions/Communications/MosaicHistory/history.html), was announced. I wish I could remember the first time I browsed the web, but I don't think I was on the web til later in '93 or probably even '94. I probably said something like "big deal, it's just a glorified [telnet](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/T/Telnet.html), [gopher](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/G/Gopher.html) and [ftp](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/F/Ftp.html)". :)  I do remember setting up my own web server running on my desktop machine at work, which was connected directly to the internet **without a firewall**. Those were the days before internet crime.
