[Our database server](http://recipezaar.com) flipped out for a few minutes last night at 11p.  Nothing like getting ready for bed and thinking you need to be getting ready to hop a ferry and go downtown to reboot a server at midnight.  Granted, living on an island makes anything, esp. late night activities, more complicated, but businesses that never close can be a real drag.
