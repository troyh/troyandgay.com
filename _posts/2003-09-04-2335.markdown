I tried all last week to get the [University of Florida in Gainesville](http://www.shands.org/) to get my dad in to see a neurologist. Although they promised every time to call his doctor immediately, they never did -- doctors with their [God Complex](http://www.davidslife.com/journal/archives/000129.php) are always too busy. So no appointment was ever made. Fortunately, his physician got him to see a local neurologist. Should be just as good.

My dad visited the neurologist today and he confirmed, apparently emphatically, that he does have hydrocephalus. I feel a lot more comfortable with that as do my parents. So next Thursday he goes in for his operation.
