Today is my 45th birthday. Nothing special, I just relaxed at home, hanging out and reading, had a steak dinner and beers.

Thanks to everyone for my birthday gifts and birthday wishes.

While watching the Oregon vs Stanford game, I drank a bit of a [Pumking](http://www.stbcbeer.com/seasonals/seasonal-imperial/pumking-beer-page/). I used to love this beer every year but not as much anymore... the [diacetyl](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacetyl), which gives it its characteristic buttery flavor that I used to like, is now headache-inducing. Either it has increased or I'm getting more sensitive to diacetyl. Change is the only constant in the universe.


This bottle of cider has my name on it!:
