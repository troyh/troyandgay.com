The Seattle Times published [an article](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/pacificnw/2014828752_pacificpcapitolhill01.html?syndication=rss) about our new neighborhood, about how it used to be filled with large Catholic families. It's a bit overly-nostalgic for the "good ol' days", as if good childhoods are a thing of the past. 

The Mona mentioned in the article is a teacher at the preschool we want to get Hudson into. And I can see the dome of the [Holy Names Academy](http://www.holynames-sea.org/), which is a beautiful building, from my office window.
