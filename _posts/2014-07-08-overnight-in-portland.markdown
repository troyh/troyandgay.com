Gay and I left the kids with Gerene and drove to Portland. We took the Lexus for probably its last road trip with us, which is too bad because I love that car.

We stopped at [Prost!](http://prostportland.com/) for a quick lunch and then down to Canby to JVNW to see our brewery equipment.

After that, we went to [Apex](http://www.apexbar.com/) with Brandon, our project manager at JVNW, for some beers and then checked into our hotel and then to dinner at [Clyde Common](http://www.clydecommon.com/). I like Portland, it's always a fun place to visit, a kind of mini-Seattle to me.
