I've always been a HUGE [Nancy's Yogurt](http://www.nancysyogurt.com/) fan.  [Glad to hear they are going national so more folks can enjoy it too](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2001825721_nancys30.html), although I miss the old logo and packaging that was clearly more...well, small town, I guess.
