Finally, people are [ figuring out](http://www.business2.com/articles/web/0,1653,43153,00.html) what i said in '99 when I quit : hardware prices go down so software prices can't continue to increase, and Microsoft's marketshare is nearly 100%, so Microsoft's only future revenue graph is downward. If revenue goes down, stock price goes down, employees leave for more growth companies, Microsoft evaporates.
