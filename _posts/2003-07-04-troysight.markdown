![isight.jpg](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/isight.jpg)My boyfriend (left) is addicted to all thing gizmodo and to all things [apple](http://www.apple.com).  The [iSight](http://www.apple.com/isight/) combines these two addictions.  He has spent the past 4 days at one end of the line repeating "can you hear me?" "can you see me?"  It has been like watching Bell himself.  The darn thing is adorable, but there are flaws and the software is still quite buggy...but it is so much fun to use.  We just wish more people had webcams now...
