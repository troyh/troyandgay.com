There is some email bug circling the web again right now.  I don't know the name of it but the consequences are clear.  Your personal email is sent to everyone in your address book.  Because Recipezaar's customer support email addresses are in many people's address books, we are getting loads of mysterious "found art" emails.  Like Hal Torrance's short story "Swans Mate for Life" and Lucia Jennifer Figdor-Gemperle's "Lifeline Financial Overview Complete.doc" and all sorts of short love notes.
