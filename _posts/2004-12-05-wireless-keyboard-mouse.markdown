I [bought an Apple wireless mouse and keyboard](http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2410) and [had problems with them](http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2655) so I switched back to USB versions. Last month, Apple released [an upgrade to the D-Link bluetooth adapter firmware](http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/bluetoothfirmwareupdater12.html) so I gave them another shot. And they work great now! Cord-free again. :)
