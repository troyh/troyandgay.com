It's sad when good people die so young and especially when due to something as random as an icy sidewalk. Robert Atkins [died today](http://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/04/17/obit.atkins/index.html) at 72. He was a brave guy to defy conventional wisdom and present an alternative plan for a healthy diet. I'm sure millions of people owe their lives and happiness to this man.
