On ONN, Al Qaeda "refutes the 9/11 conspiracy theories":http://www.theonion.com/content/video/9_11_conspiracy_theories that claim the US Government brought the WTC down. Favorite quotes of the Al Qaeda operative:

bq. "How would you like it if you spent two months in a mountain cave sleeping on rocks planning something really special only to have someone take the credit away from you?"

bq. "Why would they kill 3,000 of their own infidels?"

bq. "Why is Osama bin Laden safe in, uh, somewhere?"

bq. "It's like talking to a goat!"
