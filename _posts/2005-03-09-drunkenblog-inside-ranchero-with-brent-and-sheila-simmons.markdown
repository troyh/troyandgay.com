[DrunkenBlog: Inside Ranchero with Brent and Sheila Simmons](http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000500.html): 

<blockquote>We laugh at the same stuff and enjoy so many of the same things. We like being able to do things like take a walk around the neighborhood after lunch. We like being able to play with the cat whenever he wants.

It's a little bit like farm life -- but modern, urban, digital farm life. We grow software.</blockquote>



Gay  and I both read this and thought "That's just like us!" (except the cat is a dog). We should meet these two someday, they're right here in Seattle and we use their products ([NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire) and [MarsEdit](http://ranchero.com/marsedit)).
