[Apple buying Universal Music](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-apple11apr11,1,6558114.story?coll=la%2Dhome%2Dheadlines)?! I just don't believe that Jobs is this dumb. If they do this, they'll be in Sony's boat, where their content biz conflicts with their hardware biz. Full disclosure: I'm an Apple shareholder, I download music for free (just to see if it's worth buying) and I luvs my Mac and my iPod.
