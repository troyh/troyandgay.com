My [iSight](http://apple.com/isight) arrived today. It's classic great Apple packaging and most of it is well-designed. But the mounting system(s) is terrible design. To assemble/disassemble it from the mounting base, it comes apart in five pieces. It's all designed to make it look good when it's mounted, but surely they could've come up with a better design.

The mounting situation is horrible for anyone without a laptop. The only mount to mount it on the back of a flat panel display has a sticky base so it's more or less permanent. Not a good idea. And the Apple displays are curved in the back no there's no flat surface to mount the base properly. But zip ties to the rescue... I mounted it like [this guy](http://homepage.mac.com/dayman/isight.jpg) did. Not pretty, but it works until Apple or a 3rd party comes out with a better mount.

iChat AV is buggy still too.
