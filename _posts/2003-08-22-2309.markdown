The NY Times has an [article on Seattle](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/22/travel/escapes/22HOUR.html?ex=1376971200&en=928cc0c36ff68a07&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND). Seattle is great in the summer. The bright blue water with the white boats skimming along with mountain ranges in the background is a beautiful scene. But I actually prefer Seattle in the winter <gasp!>. When everyone else in the country is freezing, the trees are all dead and everyone's dreading the inevitable snow-in, I can be outside walking, sitting or riding my bike surrounded by pretty green foliage against a grey sky. And all I have to do is put on a light jacket, sweater or fleece and avoid the 10 minutes a day of rain. And if I want to go skiing, there's a ski resorts just 40 minutes away and one of the [best ski resorts in the world](http://www.whistler-blackcomb.com/) just 3 hours away. Oh, and the beer in the Pacific Northwest is plentiful and delicious.
