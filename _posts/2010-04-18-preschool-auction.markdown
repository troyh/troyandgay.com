Havana's preschool had their annual fund-raiser auction tonight. Megan & Jon agreed to be our guests and Gay volunteered her and I to work the auction.  Gay was a cashier and I helped clear the tables after each silent auction ended, which allowed me more time to mingle with Jon and Megan.

I won the auction for the very stuff we donated: a box of big beers, 2 beer glasses and a beer book. That really means that we paid for it twice, but it's for a good cause, and I really like the glasses. I also bid on a trip to Walla Walla, Washington's wine country and Gay's college town, for a couple nights at the [Marcus Whitman Hotel](http://www.marcuswhitmanhotel.com/) and a weekend of wine-tasting. I won that too. I'm travelled-out for a while but now we have to schedule a trip to Walla Walla.
