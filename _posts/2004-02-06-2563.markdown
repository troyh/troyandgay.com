If you could be anything you want I bet youd be disappointed.
Am I right?
Its hard to remember were alive for the first time.
Its hard to remember were alive for the last time.
Its hard to remember to live before you die.
Its hard to remember that our lives are such a short time.
Its hard to remember when it takes such a short time.
Its hard to remember to live before you die.
Its hard to remember.
