[Spam is annoying](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/11/001814.php#001814), but the thing I love about it is that instead of getting lawyers involved, technologists are fighting back. It's going to make the internet a less open place, but it's far better than having more laws and bigger government, in my opinion.
