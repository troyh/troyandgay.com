[With the Google Maps API two guys just put up a site where anyone can input first hand information on what is happening block by block in New Orleans](http://www.wired.com/news/hurricane/0,2904,68743,00.html).  This kind of thing simply would not have been possible before the web and web services....  The potential just amazes me.
