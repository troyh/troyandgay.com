![](http://www.recipezaar.com/images/rsssub.gif)You can now get a [feed of Recipezaar's newest recipes](http://www.recipezaar.com/rss/) (100 added each day) or subscribe to the new recipes in just the categories you are interested in... e.g. [Newest Italian Recipes](http://www.recipezaar.com/rss/183/), [Newest Low Carb Recipes](http://www.recipezaar.com/rss/287/), [Newest Vegetarian Recipes](http://www.recipezaar.com/rss/169/), [Newest Appetizer Recipes](http://www.recipezaar.com/rss/81/), [Newest Cocktail Recipes](http://www.recipezaar.com/r/195), or [Newest Low Carb Vegetarian Italian Dinner Party Appetizer Recipes](http://www.recipezaar.com/rss/169/81/183/156/287/) etc. pick from any combination of [over 200 categories](http://www.recipezaar.com/r/).

And if you are looking for an RSS Aggregator to use to view these subscriptions, we recommend [MyWireService](http://www.mywireservice.com), of course; and we offer [more help with RSS on Recipezaar](http://www.recipezaar.com/help/viewmini?iid=65).

I am pretty sure this makes us the first recipe site to support RSS.
