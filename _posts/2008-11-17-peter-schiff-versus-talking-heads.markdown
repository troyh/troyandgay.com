Watch this compilation of financial shows with Peter Schiff starting more then two years ago predicting the housing crash, the credit crunch and a long recession while all the other "experts" literally laughed at him and called him "pessimistic":

Ben Stein, proving that bad actors should not go on TV pretending to be economists, even declared Merrill Lynch "an astonishingly well-run company" -- less than a year later Merrill Lynch doesn't exist anymore, they were so well-run.

And it's all mostly Fox News, which again, proves that if you watch Fox News and believe what comes out of the speaker your brain is filled with falsehoods.
