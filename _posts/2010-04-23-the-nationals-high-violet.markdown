The New York Times has [an article](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/magazine/25national-t.html) about the making of [The National](http://americanmary.com/index.php)'s new album and they're streaming the entire album today through Tuesday. The single, "Bloodbuzz Ohio", is [available free for download](http://www.highviolet.com/) too. I've been waiting almost 3 years, since their brilliant album "Boxer", for their next album. Just 18 more days to wait.
