[Gui Avoider](http://homepage.mac.com/mstamper77/CoolStuff%20folder/CoolStuff/) explains why they are more productive on a Mac. I have to agree, as a long-time Mac-hater (I still think pre-OS X Macs sucked), the first thing that struck me about OS X is that I think about what I'm doing rather than how I'm doing it. Windows and Linux GUIs are both so difficult to use that I find myself struggling with the tool rather than getting the job done. OS X is a pleasure to use, and I don't say that about many tech products.
