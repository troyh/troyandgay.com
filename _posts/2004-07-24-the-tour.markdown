Since I last wrote, the Tour has regained its excitement (too exciting to write about it!). Lance has decimated his rivals. He's got over 4 minutes and it isn't even Ullrich that is #2, but Ullrich's teammate. It was as great as ever watching Lance charge up the mountains and watching his rivals fail to hold his wheel. Seeing that is one of the greatest things in sport, IMO. And his team ran a perfect race the entire time. This has got to be the easiest Tour win yet for Lance. 7 maybe??!
