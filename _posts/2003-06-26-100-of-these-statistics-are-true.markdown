So you've heard the scary stat that 22% of American's believe Iraq actually _used_ WMD in the war -- no wonder we can't find them, they done used 'em all up.  [More Harper's Bazaar-type statistics plucked from PollingReport.com by Tom Tomorrow](http://www.thismodernworld.com/weblog/mtarchives/week_2003_06_15.html#000779):

56% think in war, the media should support the government over questioning it
40% believe the media was biased in favor of Bill Clinton
33% believe a wife should "submit herself graciously" to a husband
30% say the Bible is the "actual word of God" to be taken literally
20% approve of the how the Catholic Church handles pedophilia
20% believe that the killing of civilians in Vietnam was "relatively rare"
