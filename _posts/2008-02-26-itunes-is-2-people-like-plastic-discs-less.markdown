"iTunes is the #2 music retailer":http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/apwire/3b1598c8ab1bfa1ede9001d01f339a74.htm in the US, behind Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart may be cheap, but iTunes is convenient. The report clearly shows that CDs are dying, but Wal-Mart dropped their online store "two months ago":http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/071228/wal_mart_movie_downloads.html to focus on selling plastic discs. Amazon used to be #4, presumably because they sold CDs. Now that they have their download store open, they've fallen from #4 to #5 since "June 2007":http://www.afterdawn.com/news/archive/10155.cfm, despite "good":http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/mini-review/amazon-non+drm-mp3-store-now-in-public-beta-easy-to-use-303295.php "reviews":http://gigaom.com/2007/09/25/amazon-mp3-vs-apple-itunes-whos-better-now/ of the service. It's all about the iPod integration, I think. iTunes will be #1.
