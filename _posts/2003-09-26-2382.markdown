Yikes! An [8.0 earthquake](http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/east/09/25/japan.earthquake/index.html) hit Japan today. The [USGS data](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/recenteqsww/Quakes/uszdap.htm). That's almost 30 times worse than the [6.8 in Seattle in 2001](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/quak28ww.shtml), which was pretty scary. Good thing it hit on an island and not Tokyo or there would be incredible casualties. The biggest earthquake ever was a [9.5 in 1960](http://wwwneic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/eqlists/WORLD/1960_05_22.html).
