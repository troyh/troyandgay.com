The Steelers are one of only six teams that don't have cheerleaders. I like that. Unfortunately, they created a mascot last year: "Steely McBeam":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steely_McBeam. And to make matters worse, he was just "arrested for drunk driving":http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08100/871780-66.stm?cmpid=steelers.xml.

Incidentally, the "Beam" in his last name was inspired by "Jim Beam":http://www.jimbeam.com/. What did they expect?
