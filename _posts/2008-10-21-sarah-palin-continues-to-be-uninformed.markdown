Sarah Palin _still_ doesn't know what the Vice President does. She was asked before she was picked by McCain and admitted she doesn't know what the VP does. You'd think after that embarrassment, she'd go ask someone or, yikes, read something so she'd finally know. Nope, it's clearly not important to her. Yesterday, two weeks before the election, "she was asked again":http://www.9news.com/video/default.aspx?aid=63586 what the VP does and she proved she still hasn't learned the answer. Here's what she said:

bq. That's something Piper would ask me, as a 2nd-grader, also.

Good thing Piper didn't ask her, also. Imagine the other misinformation she teaches her kids.

bq. A Vice President has a really great job. Cuz not only are they there to support the President's agenda, they're like the team member, the teammate to that President, but they're also in charge of the Senate so if they want to they can really get in there with the senators and make a lot of good policy changes that will make life better for Brandon and his family and his classroom.

The VP does not get involved in the Senate's policy changes. The most a VP does is vote in a tie-breaker and the last time that happened was [in 1989](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Vice_Presidents%27_tie-breaking_votes). If you were hiring someone for a job, would you hire someone who not only doesn't know what the job is, but doesn't even care to know?

Notice how relieved she looked when the interviewer said the next question was coming from a 3rd grader and not one of those hard questions from reporters. Unfortunately for her, she can't even answer questions from 3rd graders correctly. In what grade do you learn about the three branches of the US Government? Sarah Palin wants to have the #2 job in the US Government and doesn't even know that she would be in the Executive Branch, not in the Legislative Branch.
