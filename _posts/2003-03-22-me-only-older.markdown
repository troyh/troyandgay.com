My birthday was today.  In celebration of being 33, I ran 3 laps (instead of my usual 2) for a total of 7 1/2 miles.  I really had a terrific day -- aside from troubles with Recipezaar going down for a couple of hours due to an unsuccessful memory upgrade.  Troy went shopping with me and didn't complain once.  We had a LOVELY dinner at [Dahlia Lounge](http://tomdouglas.com/dahlia.html) with good friends Eric & Steve and Biff & Renuka.  We got to celebrate Eric's new job and I outted Renuka's pregnancy -- there, now everyone on the internet knows.
