We made it to Taipei! We watched a movie called [The Notebook](http://www.thenotebookmovie.com/) on the plane. Never heard of it, but Gay cried like a baby. After a 2-hour layover we're off to San Francisco for an 11-hour flight. Hopefully we'll make our connecting flight to Seattle, catch the 11:30pm ferry to Vashon and be at home by midnight. :)
