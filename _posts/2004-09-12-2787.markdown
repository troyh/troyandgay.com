Powell said the huge explosion in North Korea is "not a nuclear test":http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&e=2&u=/ap/20040912/ap_on_re_as/nkorea_explosion. That confused me, I thought for sure they'd use this to prove that North Korea is a threat. Why would they quickly work to diminish fears that would certainly help Bush's re-election?

Maybe "Richard Reeves":http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/ucrr/20040912/cm_ucrr/whatifwehadnotgoneintoiraq has the answer: _Among the many people quoted in the Atlantic is Jeffrey Record, a professor of strategy at the Army War College, who summed up a good deal of the thinking in Washington now: "Are we better off in basic security than before we invaded Iraq? The answer is no. An unnecessary war has consumed American Army and other ground resources, to the point where we have nothing left in the cupboard for another contingency -- for instance, should the North Koreans decide that with the Americans completely absorbed in Iraq, now is the time to do something."_
