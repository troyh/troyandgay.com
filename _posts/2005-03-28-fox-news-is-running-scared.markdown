Wow, even Fox News, the "What To Think Network", is [running scared of the Terri Schiavo story now](http://www.newshounds.us/2005/03/27/white_house_to_fox_news_steer_clear_of_schiavo.php). Great quotes:


<blockquote>
"Fox finally found an issue it couldn't brainwash the public into supporting."

"All of the fanatics where handed a new scapegoat on a silver platter, Jeb Bush. Goes to show how fickle and dangerous fanatics can be."
