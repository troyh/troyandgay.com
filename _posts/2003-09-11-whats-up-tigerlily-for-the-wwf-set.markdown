![team_onistr.jpg](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/team_onistr.jpg)[Troy's brother](http://www.hakalas.com) turned us on to this new show on the Spike TV network: [Most Extreme Elimination Challenge](http://www.spiketv.com/shows/meec/).  He characterized it as Jackass3, but it is much crazier than that.  Apparently a real Japanese show called ["Takashi's Castle"](http://homepage.ntlworld.com/kevin.kempthorne/Takeshi/) where normal folks in incomprehensible costumes endure ridiculous and straining physical challenges (41 people have broken their ribs in the show's 2 seasons!) is then re-dubbed with subtle and not subtle ribald humor.  It sounds so stupid when I try to explain it...there is a real iron-chef-meets-beavis-and-butthead thing going on.   (thurs, sat & sun at 9)
