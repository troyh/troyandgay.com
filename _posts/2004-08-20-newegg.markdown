I ordered one "small thing":http://www.buy.com/retail/product.asp?sku=10346406&loc=101&sp=1 from "buy.com":http://buy.com last night and never heard a thing about it, no receipt, no shipment notification, nothing. I ordered three things from "NewEgg.com":http://newegg.com this afternoon and all have already shipped.
