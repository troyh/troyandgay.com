We watched a [Discovery Channel](http://www.discovery.com/) special on the [Gangs Of New York](http://video.movies.go.com/gangsofnewyork/) DVD and learned that when policemen formed in NYC they were made fun of (or hated) because their uniforms looked like English policemen. So they eventually trimmed their uniforms down to just their badge on their chest that was made of copper. This is where the term "coppers" (and the shortened "cops") came from to refer to the police.
