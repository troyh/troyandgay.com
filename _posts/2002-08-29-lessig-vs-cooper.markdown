[Lawrence Lessig](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/archives/cooper.shtml) has a response to Charles Cooper's [stupid article](http://news.com.com/2010-1071-954964.html) (it's like watching Michael Jordan play basketball or Armstrong ride away from the peloton on the mountains). He makes a very good case about expiring copyrights on software. Think of the 10-year expiration in terms of Windows... today, Windows 3.1 would expire and it would be released to the public domain. That wouldn't hurt Microsoft at all, could really benefit the people who still use Win3.1 today (I'm sure there are some) and would force Microsoft to constantly improve their product. Where's the downside?
