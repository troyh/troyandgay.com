I had to go to the house today to move the speakers I installed in the foyer. They had to be installed early because they're installed into the drywall and the drywallers needed to tape and mud it over. But the interior designers picked some [antelope](http://www.restorationhardware.com/catalog/product/product.jsp?productId=prod80525&searchId=1301502757719) [heads](http://www.restorationhardware.com/catalog/product/product.jsp?productId=prod80521&categoryId=) we want to hang in the same place the speakers were installed, so the speakers need to be moved over to make it possible to mount the heads.

Gay, Eva and I took the 9:40a ferry and got to the house by 10:30a after a quick stop at Top Pot Doughnuts. Mark from Twisted Metalworks was there finishing the bracket installation in the attic, the tile guys finished the kitchen floor and were getting ready to do the bathroom walls, Kurt was busy with window and door trim, Colin was finishing up the blocking in the basement ceiling (which looks original!), and the cabinetry was being installed in the kitchen and butler's pantry.

Colin and I worked on the foyer speakers, he did the south one and I did the north one, but we had to go before we finished, so I left it to Colin to finish.
