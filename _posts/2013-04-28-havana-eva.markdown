There's a movie named after both our daughters:

So, there's a movie named after me, [Troy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332452/), (starring Brad Pitt as me, good casting!), a movie named after Gay, [Happy Gilmore](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116483/?ref_=sr_1), a movie named after Havana, [Havana](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099747/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) starring Robert Redford who I assume plays her father (another brilliant casting choice), a movie kinda named after Hudson, [Hudson Hawk](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102070/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), two movies named after Eva, [Eva](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1105740/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_20) and [Eva](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1298554/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2), and now a movie named after both Havana and Eva.

If I weren't dumb and unable to see obvious patterns, I'd trademark the titles "Gay Troy", "Havana Hudson", "Hudson Eva", etc.
