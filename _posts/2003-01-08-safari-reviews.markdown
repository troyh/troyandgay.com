Crikey, there's already several detailed reviews of [](http://www.apple.com/safari/)Safari: [Mark Pilgrim's](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/01/07.html#safari_review) and scroll to the bottom to find several more, including MovableType's [Mena Trott](http://www.sixapart.com/log/2003/01/initial_reactio.shtml).





Also, the lead dev for Safari sent [email](http://lists.kde.org/?l=kfm-devel&m=104197092318639&w=2) to the KHTML mailing list announcing the open-source-ness of Safari and thanking them. It's very cool to see big companies like [Apple](http://www.apple.com) embracing and working with open source devs. It's a new world.





Interestingly, many Safari devs are ex-Eazel people. And [David Hyatt](http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/), the dev behind Chimera, apparently was  hired more because he is the creator of XBL than for Chimera.
