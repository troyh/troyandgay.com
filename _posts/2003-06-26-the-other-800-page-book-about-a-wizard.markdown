[![clintonwars.jpg](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/clintonwars.jpg)I'm reading The Clinton Wars](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374125023/recipezaar-20) by Sidney Blumenthal right now.  I'm almost halfway done but my Harry Potter is due to arrive any day now and I'm afraid once I put this tome down I may not go back.  For as lengthy as it is, I find myself wishing Blumenthal would go into more character detail about the players.  The book is really starting to pick up now that I have reached the period where the author has joined the staff.  ...and if you ever thought there was anything *but* a right-wing conspiracy, you should read this book.
