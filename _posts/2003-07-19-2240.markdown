Ullrich beat Lance in the individual time trial  yesterday by **1 minute 36 seconds**. That's a very wide margin to put into one of the best time trialists in the world especially for someone who has been out of racing for the last couple years. Ullrich moved up to #2 (Tyler Hamilton moved up to #4) behind Lance just 34 seconds back. The mountains this weekend are going to be very interesting.
