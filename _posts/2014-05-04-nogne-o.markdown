This beer has been sitting in my beer fridge for 7 years and I decided to drink it tonight because I just haven't found a special occasion. Havana's 7th birthday weekend and a Saturday night is appropriate enough. They recommend drinking it after 2009 but before 2020 and it's supposedly the Norwegian brewery's [most sought-after beer](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%B8gne_%C3%98), the first edition of it. 17.5% ABV. 

It's super dark and a bit sweet with licorice and wood flavors. Slightly solvent aroma. It's not easy to drink, but I'm managing.
