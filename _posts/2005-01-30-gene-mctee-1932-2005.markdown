Gay & I went to [Tacoma](http://www.cityoftacoma.org/10Home/default.asp) this morning to attend the funeral service for Gene McTee, who died suddenly of a stroke last week at the age of 72. Gene's wife of 50 years, Shirley, and my mom are cousins so we went to the service since my mom and dad couldn't (they live in Florida). I had met them a few times while my parents were visiting Seattle the last few years and they attended our wedding last summer, which was the last time I saw Gene.
