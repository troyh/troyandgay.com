We left "Olson Kundig":http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/10/01/tom-kundig-is-a-genius/, stopped at Fuel Coffee for coffee and a scone, and then went to the house to meet with the electrical subcontractor.

We gave him our plan for the low-voltage (audio, video, networking) work we want and we showed him where we want speakers and outlets installed. We also talked about how much of the electrical we will replace, including light fixtures.

That took a while. Then Doug had brought sandwiches for lunch so we had lunch with him and Mark. We made it to the 3:05p ferry and were back home by 3:30.
