![John & Gay](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/john&gay.jpg)When [John](http://www.hklaw.com/Biographies/Bio.asp?id=61560) said he had a "box seat" at Safeco Field, I figured he had a few seats roped off. But we find ourselves in a suite! Catered food, free beer & wine and a great view of the field. We had a great time watching the game and we're not even baseball fans. Mariners won, 12-7.
