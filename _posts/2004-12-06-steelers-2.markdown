It was a great game (because they won) but they almost blew it by penalties -- although a couple were bad calls by the ref, the Steelers looked stupid and sloppy.  Nevertheless, they won 17-16 by a last minute field goal and are now 11-1 for the season. Unfortunately, the Steelers are looking worse heading into the playoffs while New England and the Eagles are both getting better.
