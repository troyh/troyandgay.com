We went to [Brouwer's](http://brouwerscafe.blogspot.com/) Big Wood wood-aged beer festival this afternoon to beat the rush. Just a couple hours after it started it was standing room only.

All great, but the standout was Fort George's Vortex IPA aged in Wild Turkey barrels â€“ a delicious resin and citrus IPA with a smoothness that approached a nitro pour:

We ate a late lunch there and then walked around Fremont and sat at Starbucks with a coffee to let the beer wear off. Then we drove around downtown and then to Capitol Hill for a light sushi dinner at [Momiji](http://momijiseattle.com/#home_).
