It's fun to build something and release it for the world to try. And tonight I found the [1st review](http://www.librarystuff.net/new_archives/000618.html) of [MyWireService](http://mywireservice.com). Pretty good. Yes, we do need more feeds. But I always love when people notice performance, cuz it's hard to do (and we haven't really concentrated on performance much yet).
