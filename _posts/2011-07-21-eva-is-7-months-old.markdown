Eva is 7 months old today. She has two teeth now so she's teething. She is starting to learn to crawl, just barely pulling herself along the floor when she really wants to. She's now sleeping in her own bedroom and doing a pretty good job, but occasionally ends up in bed with us. She's still eating well and can almost hold her own bottle up and drink from it. She's still a good baby but has Hudson's vocal cords, so we hardly need a baby monitor to hear her.
