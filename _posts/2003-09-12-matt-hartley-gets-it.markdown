Matt Hartley [recommends](http://rss.lockergnome.com/archives/opinion/007108.phtml) using [MyWireService](http://mywireservice.com) for newbies. He's right and he clearly understands the flaws in RSS.

Telling the average person who reads news they need "an RSS aggregator" is like telling a television viewer they need "a radio wave tuner and cathode ray tube". This is what technologists always fail to grasp. Worse, they call RSS a "simple" technology. Yes, it's simple to someone who understands HTTP and HTML, but it's not simple to most people.

RSS, like XML (because it is XML), is useful to programmers only. Software must step up several levels to make it approachable to real people and that's where MyWireService comes in.
