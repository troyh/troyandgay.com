It's very encouraging news that [the US will give another $600 million for the Tsunami aid](http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/02/09/tsunami.aid/index.html) because even Wolfowitz realizes that it's a great PR move: _"Above and beyond the humanitarian considerations -- which would be compelling enough -- we have an enormous interest in seeing this succeed," Wolfowitz said, noting Indonesia's status as both an "emerging democracy" and the world's most populous Muslim country."_

I think the US Govt is finally starting to get it; a successful war on terror is 10% destruction and 90% education. Right now, we're at 99% destruction and 1% education, but we're going in the right direction.
