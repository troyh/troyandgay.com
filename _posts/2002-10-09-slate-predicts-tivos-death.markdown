title: Slate predicts TiVo's death

Not terribly surprising, coming from the Microsoft puppet, but [Slate says TiVo will die](http://slate.msn.com/?id=2072037). This is all based on the concept that the "first-mover" tends to die (2 years ago I'm sure Slate predicted the crushing victory of every first-mover). It's also full of other stupid reasons (it is Slate after all) but wisely realizes that licensing is key. But then comes to the conclusion that XBox (doesn't Microsoft make that?) will beat TiVo. Huh? Xbox, the same product that is getting slammed by the PS2?! Of course, there's no mention of Microsoft's other dismal failure: UltimateTV.
