I just (re)discovered [The Visual Thesaurus](http://www.visualthesaurus.com/online/index.html).  Granted, they don't have a large data set yet, but I think the spider diagram is actually a very effective representation...much better than the traditional Roget's double look-up.  Wonder how we could represent related recipes or similar chefs this way -- am I too obsessed that this was my first thought?  (Met the founder of this company when he was working with my friend [Cindy](http://www.netomat.com/company/people/management.php#Cindy_Pound) at [Razorfish](http://www.razorfish.com))
