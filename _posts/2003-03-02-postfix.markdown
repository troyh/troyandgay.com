I finally went against the geek in me and ditched [sendmail](http://sendmail.org) from our internal mail server and moved to the simpler [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org). The reason being that I simply couldn't figure out how to configure sendmail to send mail to another server as a relay. Seems so simple and I even read the [bat book](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/sendmail2/) to try to figure it out, but was unsuccessful. Postfix did it with one configuration setting.

[Fetchmail](http://fetchmail.org) still pulls down our mail from our public mail server to our internal server and it worked without a hitch with Postfix. And Postfix was amazingly easy to install, it even makes itself a replacement for sendmail by aliasing the sendmail binaries to itself. I wish I'd done this years ago!
