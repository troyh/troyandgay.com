It's a famous hotel in San Diego, built in 1888 and restored in the 20th century. All in all, a nicer hotel with more friendly staff than the [W](http://www.starwoodhotels.com/whotels/index.html) in downtown, and half the price!

We flew back Tuesday afternoon and arrived in rainy Seattle and home at 7pm. Gay's dad and aunt stayed at the house while we were gone and they really tired Ouzo out, which is not easy.
