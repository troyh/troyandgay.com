We've been married for 4 years today. Gay's mom, dad and aunts met us at the hotel as we checked-in and they babysat Havana while we went out to dinner. We went to "Wild Sage":http://www.wildsagebistro.com/, "Downtown Spokane's Premier Restaurant". The food was okay. Gay's pasta was overcooked, my goat cheese stuffed chicken was a bit too rich, but the appetizers were pretty good.
