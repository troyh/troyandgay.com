How do businesses expect to make money in the bandwidth business? In 2000, we had a T1 line (that's 1.5Mbps) installed and paid $1200/month and that was the best price at the time. Today, we can get a 5Mbps line for $350/mo. That's over 3x faster for less than 30% of the cost. Not quite [Moore's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) yet, but at this rate, by 2012 bandwidth will essentially be free.
