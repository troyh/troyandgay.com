Spent the greater part of yesterday working on our business taxes -- due March 15.  The government actually made it easier on small business this year by not requiring a lot of accounting rigamaroll.  It still cracks me up when they have to list the estimated amount of time it takes to fill out the forms and do recording keeping for them as part of the Paperwork Reduction Act -- would you like a receipt for your reciept?

Also watched "City by the Sea" which was good.
