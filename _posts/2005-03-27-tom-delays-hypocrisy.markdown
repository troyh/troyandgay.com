Tom DeLay, who called the judge and Michael Schiavo "terrorists", [took his own father off life support 16 years ago](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002221334_delay27.html) and asked the doctors to not resuscitate his father, even though he could have lived, albeit in a vegetative state because his father "wouldn't have wanted to live like that".

Moreover, Tom DeLay sued (and won) the company that made the coupling that caused his father's injury. And Tom DeLay has since spearheaded legislation to protect corporations from such lawsuits.

Do as I say, not as I do.
