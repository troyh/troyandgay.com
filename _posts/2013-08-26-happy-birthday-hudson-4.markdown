Hudson turned 5 today. He's very happy to be 5, he's been talking for months about turning 5 and his birthday couldn't come quick enough. I woke up alone when Eva came into our bed with her big Olivia book to show me all the clothes Olivia was wearing. Gay was already awake and took Havana and Hudson to Top Pot to get doughnuts.

We spent the morning getting ready for Hudson's party.  The kids spent most of the morning on the trampoline. The party started at 2pm.
