The NYT is covering "the oil spill that hit Vashon Island":http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/31/national/31spill.html?ex=1256875200&en=c8c05500a7b58d58&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland: "On Vashon island, residents simply want the offender caught and punished." That's an understatement.  Why does this take so long?
