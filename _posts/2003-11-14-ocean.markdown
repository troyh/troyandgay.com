![OCEAN45C.jpg](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/OCEAN45C.jpg)When the seasons change (and I get sick), I blow my runny nose too much and get regular bloody noses.  My doctor told me to buy ["Ocean" a nasal spray](http://www.flemingcompany.com/Product/ocean.htm) at the pharmacy to combat the problem.  A look at the ingredients tells you it really is "ocean", just saline solution in a nasal spray bottle.  I think it is a beautiful name.
Now a Seattle company is working on [a nasal spray that will curb hunger](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/13/science/13SPRA.html?ex=1384059600&en=258e4b7b918295f6&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND) by getting the "you're full" hormone into the blood stream.  Ingenious.  And a [genuine good use of technology](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/10/001780.php).
