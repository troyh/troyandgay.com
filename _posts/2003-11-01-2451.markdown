It's my birthday and Saturday morning so I'm catching up on some online reading and here's some interesting things I've found, in no particular order...

[Meg](http://www.megnut.com/archive.asp?which=2003_10_01_archive.inc#007532) has a great experience with Apple's customer service. [IT on $5/day](http://www.infoworld.com/infoworld/reports/SRitbudget.html) is inline with the way we do IT on [Recipezaar](http://recipezaar.com); inexpensive commodity hardware is a wonderful thing. [Jason Kottke](http://www.kottke.org/03/10/expose-panther) suggests an improvement to Mac OS X's Expos√© feature. I am still in love with OS X 10.3, but Tim O'Reilly has some [criticisms of it](http://jim.roepcke.com/6644) and about the future of technology.

[A more realistic audio](http://www.blogjam.com/neil_armstrong/) of Armstrong walking on the moon. ![](/img/smile.gif) (Warning: profanities ahead).
