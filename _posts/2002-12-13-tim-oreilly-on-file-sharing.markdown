In [Piracy is Progressive Taxation, and Other Thoughts on the Evolution of Online Distribution](http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2002/12/11/piracy.html), Tim O'Reilly explains why electronic distribution is valuable and desirable. He also predicts that subscription sites will flourish and notes that HBO, a subscription service on top of your cable (ISP) bill, is television's most profitable network. Why? Because of content.
