I've missed the rain; and the green grass. I hope it rains for the next few days.

We missed the first release of "Dry Fly":http://www.dryflydistilling.com/main.php whiskey this weekend -- all sold out state-wide. This is the first whiskey made in Washington since Prohibition from the first distillery in Washington since Prohibition. They will be releasing another batch around the holidays, we'll have to be more on top of it then. We "visited":http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/02/dry-fly-distillery/ Dry Fly last year.
