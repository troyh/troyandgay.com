Ballmer [is clueless about open source](http://news.com.com/2100-1001-959165.html?tag=dd.ne.dht.nl-sty.0). They actually think the MVPs are going to equate to open source coders? Ever meet an MVP? A businessman (Ballmer) will never understand what is about open source that is attractive. When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. When you are a businessman, everything looks like a dollar.
