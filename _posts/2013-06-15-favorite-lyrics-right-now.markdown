Do my crying underwater,
I can't get down any farther.
All my drowning friends can see,
Now there is no running from it.
It's become the crux of me,
I wish that I could rise above it.

…

Everyday I start so great,
then the sunlight dims.
The less I've learned, the more I see
the pythons and the limbs.
Do not know what's wrong with me,
sours in the cup.
When I walk into a room,
I do not light it up.

...

Tiny bubbles hang above me.
It's a sign that someone loves me.

…

Oh, don't tell anyone I'm here
I've got Tylenol and beer
