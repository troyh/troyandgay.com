We're in New York City for the first time since [we were here in 2002](http://troyandgay.com/2002/12/06/new-york-vacation/). We're here, without the kids, to see the initial design concepts for our brewery logo. 

On our way to dinner near our hotel we came across [The Hudson Hotel](http://www.hudsonhotel.com/), where we stayed 11 years ago. Because our son's name is Hudson, and probably subconsciously named after the hotel, we couldn't resist having a Manhattan there and ended up having dinner there too (at 10:30pm local time).

Good dinner, lobster roll sandwich and cheeseburger with thrice-cooked fries and Peking duck fries. The beer situation is much better these days, lots of local small craft beers on tap.
