Sounds like [the war is over](http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/04/14/sprj.irq.war.main/index.html).

Let's summarize:




  * 27 days long (3 days less than the anticipated 30 days)


  * Less than 100 US casualties (in '91, the US had 147 casualties)


  * Hundreds of Iraqi civilians dead


  * Unknown, but likely thousands, of Iraqi military dead


  * We don't know where Saddam is, but we know he's not in power


  * We haven't found any chemical weapons yet


  * $75 billion spent so far
