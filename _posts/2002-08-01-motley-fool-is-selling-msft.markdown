[Today it's time to say "Sayonara, ."](http://www.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2002/rulemaker020731.htm)  It all comes down to an issue of character. In this case the company has failed to maintain the best interests of outside shareowners. By declining to show true leadership on the stock option expensing issue -- which management claims to agree with --  no longer meets the criteria of a Rule Maker company.
