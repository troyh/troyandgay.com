Havana and Hudson went to the neighbors to swim in their pool so we took Eva to Cal Anderson Park for the Seattle Street Food Fair â€“ a bunch of food trucks. We got there before the big crowds hit but I did wait in line, something I never do, for 45 minutes (!) at [Monte Cristo truck](http://mobilemontecristo.com/), while Gay and Eva collected other things, because we'd heard good things.  It was good.

Other goodies: deep-fried PB&J, the Reubenator and pork sliders.
