Reading beer blogs, I discovered that the [New Jersey Beer Co](http://www.njbeerco.com/home.html) just made a new beer called Hudson Ale. Technically, it's called "Hudson Pale Ale", but close enough. They beat us to it, we planned one day to make a beer and call it "Hudson Ale" becauseÂ Hudson, our son, has a middle name of "Ale", which was a rejected first name. I own the domain name hudsonale.com just for this purpose. I emailed the brewery asking if I could get a t-shirt or glass or something with this label.
