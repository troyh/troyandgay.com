The new [Decemberists](http://www.decemberists.com) album, _[Picaresque](http://pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/d/decemberists/picaresque.shtml)_, is great.  It's a bit early, maybe, but I think this will be their masterpiece album, their _Boy with the Arab Strap_ or their _OK Computer_, the album they'll be spending the rest of their career trying to match.

_Cheer them on to their rivals,
'cause America can, and America can't say no.
And America does if America says it's so, it's so.
And the anchorperson on TV goes
"La-di-da-di-da."_

Speaking of Radiohead and Belle & Sebastian... Radiohead are [starting](http://pitchforkmedia.com/news/05-03/23.shtml) their next album and [Belle & Sebastian](http://www.belleandsebastian.com/) are releasing [a "best of" CD](http://www.belleandsebastian.com/newsstory.php?id=222) -- I remember when they were so prolific they couldn't make CDs fast enough, now they're just making compilations?!
