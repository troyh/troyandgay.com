For our 11th Anniversary, Gay surprised me by arranging for Gerene & Charlie to take the kids, Patrick & Dierdre to take Barley and we had a night away at a hotel. We went to Lark for a cocktail and then to Omega Ouzeria for dinner where we discovered Summer, the daughter of Hudson and Eva's preschool teacher, is the hostess.

After walking around Capitol Hill for a while, we went to the brewery to experience it at night, something we will rarely ever get to do.
