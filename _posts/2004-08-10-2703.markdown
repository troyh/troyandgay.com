![](tinyj.gif)Did you know that the term "spinster":http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=spinster is derived from the fact that women who didn't marry supported themselves through "spinning", or weaving? And, surprisingly, there's only one "Spinner's Guild":http://www.textilelinks.com/guild/ri.html in all of Rhode Island. I wonder  how many spinners there are in Rhode Island. I know of at least one, but she's unhappy because she has to spin all by herself.
