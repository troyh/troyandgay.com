So bin Laden (yes, he's _still_ alive!) released a videotape today. In March 2002, Bush "said he's not concerned with bin Laden":http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/03/20020313-8.html ("video":http://homepage.mac.com/njenson/movies/notconcerned.html). Is he concerned about him now? If not, when? If he's not concerned about him, should we be concerned about him?
