Ben (of Ben & Jerry's) [explains](http://ww11.e-tractions.com/truemajority/oreo/landing/index.htm) how we can fix problems in America without even denting our military defense. The most interesting part is that the US spends $40 billion on defense, but who are we defending ourselves from? Russia, our ally? They spend $7 billion. China, our most favored nation? They spend $5 billion. "Axis of Evil"? They spend less than $1 billion. Why do we spend so much on defense when we could be spending to educate our citizens? Oh... duh. Nevermind.
