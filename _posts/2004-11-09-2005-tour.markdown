The "team talks":http://www.velonews.com/race/int/articles/7180.0.html about the Tour with or without Lance and the Discovery Channel seems okay with it. And "readers talk":http://www.velonews.com/news/fea/7179.0.html about what race(s) he'd do instead. I'd like to see him ride the "Giro":http://www.gazzetta.it/Speciali/Giroditalia/, but given that he lives in Spain, the "Vuelta":http://www.lavuelta.com/ seems like a more natural choice. And the attention he'd give these other big races would be good for the sport and for American cycling (Americans, of course, think there's only one bike race all year).
