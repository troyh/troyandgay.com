The Gordon Ramsay restaurant, Murano, that [we went to when we were in London](http://www.luxist.com/2009/09/02/ramsay-proteges-fare-better-than-ramsay-in-london-restaurant-sur/) was just voted [London's best new restaurant](http://www.hardens.com/restaurant-news/uk-london/01-09-09/press-release-hardens-london-restaurants-2010/) by Harden's London Restaurants Guide. It's definitely one of the top 3 dining experiences I've ever had, if not _the_ best. It's too bad that Seattle doesn't have a restaurant of that caliber for special occasions.
