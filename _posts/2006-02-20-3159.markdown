Washington State is trying to get organized about marketing its beers.

Washington does have great breweries, [Maritime](http://maritimebrewery.citysearch.com/) and [Pike Brewing Co](http://www.pikebrewing.com/) and even [Red Hook](http://www.redhook.com/), are great Seattle brewers and brewpubs like [Elysian](http://www.elysianbrewing.com/) and [Big Time](http://www.bigtimebrewery.com/) makes great beer too. But I have to admit, most of the beers I drink are from Oregon and California because they're better. It's heresy in Seattle to say this, but Seattle's biggies, [Pyramid](http://www.pyramidbrew.com/) and [Hale's](http://www.halesales.com/), are not very good breweries, in my opinion -- if your top beer is a Hefeweizen, it's time to find a new brewmaster.

Maybe getting Washington beers noticed will help Washington State brewers to start making better beers when they realize they aren't as good as [Deschutes](http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/splash/default.aspx), [North Coast](http://www.northcoastbrewing.com/), [Sierra Nevada](http://www.sierranevada.com/), etc.
