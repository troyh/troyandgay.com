Last night Gay went to a mom's night out at Jenny's house and Gerene stayed late to put the kids to bed, so I got to watch _The Desolation of Smaug_ (part two of the travel, fight, travel, fight trilogy) and drink my Vienna Lager and my Saison. Tonight, Gay and Jenny went to a school party and I have to babysit but Charlotte D came over so they play and watch a movie while I read Steve Hindy's entertaining new book.  Once I get them to bed, I get to watch _Godfather 2_ (new iTunes bundle deal: $9.99 to buy _Godfather 1 & 2_ but you have to take the 3rd too) and drink Sam Adams' Tetravis, a barrel-aged Quad in their "funk" series. I am easily entertained.
