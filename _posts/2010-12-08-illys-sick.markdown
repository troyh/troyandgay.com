18 months ago, Illy had "sudden dizziness". Last week, she got it again. This time it took longer to go away and when it did, she still wouldn't eat or drink much. By the time she wouldn't even get up and couldn't keep food down we called the vet. They sent someone over (vet housecall!) to look at her today.

We ended up giving her an IV of fluid to see if she feels better. A few hours later and she was noticeably happier and more alert and even ate chicken and rice. We're going to give her Kaopectate (to calm her stomach) and Tramadol (for arthritis pain) for a few days and she if she improves.

She is 15, which is very old for a Labrador, so these things are to be expected.
