My dad had hernia surgery this week. At midnight on Friday/Saturday my dad felt bad and told my mom he wanted to go to the emergency room. He had a burning sensation in his chest and thought he was having a heart attack so they did an EKG and a CAT scan. His heart is fine but they happened to discover a tumor on his kidney. He'd be spending the weekend in the hospital and we'd all have to wait until Monday for a "bone scan" to determine if the cancer had spread to his bones.
