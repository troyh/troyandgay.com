Except for the 2 trips to the vet and late lunch break of pot stickers, Gay & I have been slaving away in front of our computers working on a _major_ change to Recipezaar's caching mechanism. We feel pretty good about it at this point and are working on pushing it up to the site. Hopefully this will go well tonight, but will require lots of monitoring and nail-biting.
