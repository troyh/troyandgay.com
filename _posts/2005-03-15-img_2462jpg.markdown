title: Powerbook arrived!

As I was riding up our road to the house on my morning bike ride, the FedEx truck came up behind me and followed me to the house and delivered my new Powerbook! It turns out that it was set for a Saturday Delivery so I _could_ have had it two days ago, but FedEx doesn't do Saturday deliveries on Vashon. (Damn you, Vashon!)
