[Seattle will be the site of an enormous (mock) Terrorist Attack monday](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/PrintStory.pl?document_id=134689821&zsection_id=268448406&slug=topoff06m&date=20030506).  Appropriately the dirty bomb is scheduled to go off at the the Tully's coffee roasting plant (mwhahaha).  I sort of wish I could volunteer to be a victim/actor -- it is as close as I hope to be to a real attack, but it would be interesting to see how it all goes down.
