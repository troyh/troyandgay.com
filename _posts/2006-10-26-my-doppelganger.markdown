A few weeks ago I got email from someone in Australia named "Troy Hakala" who found this site. "Hakala" is a common name in Finland, but "Troy" is relatively rare, but I've never heard of another Troy Hakala before. And I dominate [a Google search for Troy Hakala](http://www.google.com/search?q=troy+hakala&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a), which makes someone who loves his anonymity uncomfortable.

Today I found that the other Troy Hakala has been published on [Opinion Online](http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=5067). It sounds like Australia is no better than the US on gay rights.
