The New York Times' [36 Hours In Seattle](http://travel.nytimes.com/2011/03/27/travel/27hours-seattle.html?partner=rss&emc=rss) is centered mostly on Capitol Hill and the up and coming South Lake Union area, which is right next to Capitol Hill. It includes Volunteer Park Cafe, which is just a couple blocks from our house in "one of Seattleâ€™s oldest and prettiest neighborhoods."

This reminds me, we just found out from one of the children of the previous owner of our house that [Greg Nickels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Nickels), the previous Mayor of Seattle, grew up right next door to our house.
