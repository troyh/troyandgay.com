Crime is going down in the US, which is good, except that "murders are going up":http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=542&u=/ap/20041025/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/fbi_violent_crime_6&printer=1. In 2003, 16,503 people were murdered in the US.

In other words, we _know_ that  16,000+ Americans will be murdered next year. But, as a nation, we fear the unlikely event of a terrorist attack that will kill far fewer people some years from now. Americans expect the unlikely and ignore the guaranteed.... I guess that explains why Americans buy lottery tickets, which is something else I've never understood.
