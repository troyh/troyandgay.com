My dad's still [in the hospital](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/10/31/my-dad-in-the-hospital/) and they just got the results of the bone scan this morning and the cancer has not spread to his bones, which is very good news! He's leaving the hospital today and will have his kidney removed in the near future. I think we have to wait until then to find out if the tumor is cancerous and if it has spread to other organs.
