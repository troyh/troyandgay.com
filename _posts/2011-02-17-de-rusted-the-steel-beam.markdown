We went to the house today to look at exterior paint color samples with Nancy and My. We're pretty sure we've picked the window sash color so we can move forward with painting the windows before they go back in.

I also cleaned up the garage steel beam. It started to rust and we didn't care. Then we decided we wanted to keep it from rusting after all. So Mark set me up with a grinder and I sanded the rust off, cleaned it up with denatured alcohol and then painted it with a matte clear coat of Rustoleum.
