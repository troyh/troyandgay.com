The Motley Fool [isn't fooled](http://www.fool.com/news/take/2003/mft/mft03011701.htm) by Microsoft's announcements yesterday: _The company also declared a 2-for-1 stock split. Seriously now, when's the last time a company announced a stock split on the heels of news that would normally sink a stock organically?_





on the dividends:





_The company will earn far more interest on its wad of greenbacks than it pays out to investors as part of its new annual dividend policy. It's just a token gesture -- a case of throwing good money at bad news. They're not fooling us!_
