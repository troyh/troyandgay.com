Gay and I went to the annual auction for Hudson's preschool co-op. This one was much better than the event [last year](http://troyandgay.com/2010/04/17/preschool-auction/) -- [the venue](http://www.openspacevashon.com/) was better and the food was better. Gay didn't have to be a cashier this year either, so she got to actually be at the event. We did have to do a little work to take the auction items off the tables as each phase of the silent auction ended.

We bid on a few things but only won one: a beer and chocolate pairing with [Theo Chocolate](http://www.theochocolate.com/).
