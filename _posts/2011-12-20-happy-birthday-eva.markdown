<blockquote>You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so very special

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so f–––ing special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo</blockquote>


It's been a busy year since [she was born](http://troyandgay.com/2010/12/20/eva-holland-hakala/). She's been a great baby, very easy-going, eats well, always easy to get to sleep and she sleeps well when she's not sick. We turned her car seat around today, so now she gets to face forward in the car like the other two.
