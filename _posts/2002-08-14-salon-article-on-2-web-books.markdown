Salon has an [article](http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/08/13/media_titans/index.html) about 2 books that claim the web is dead; one says because of lack of business, the other says because of lack of content. Of course, they're both wrong. _In this context, statements like "Web content is dead" or "AOL Time Warner will dominate" aren't so much wrong as irrelevant. Web content is everywhere. No one can dominate the . And the Web belongs to its users. That's not the end of a story, it's the beginning._
