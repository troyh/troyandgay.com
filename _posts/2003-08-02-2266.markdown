[A poll](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/02/national/02BELI.html?ex=1375243200&en=7a44cdec3d3a6c66&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND) says that more than 2/3 of Americans believe that the church should weigh in on political issues. The U.S. is just 227 years old (11 generations of people) and we've already forgotten one of the biggest problems  the creation of the U.S. solved. Stunning. Americans really do have a short attention span and absolutely no sense of history.
