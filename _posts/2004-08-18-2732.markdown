Some of the cast of one of the greatest movies ever made, _Goodfellas_, "had dinner together.":http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/ap/20040817/ap_on_en_mo/goodfellas_reunion Why? Who knows, and if Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro weren't there then it wasn't really the cast. I can't believe Ray Liotta hasn't watched the movie since its premiere! I've seen it more than I've seen _Godfather II_. I remember back in 1994 I flipped on HBO and it was just starting and watched the entire thing again til 2am on a work night. I even own the movie on LaserDisc.
