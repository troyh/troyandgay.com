Wow! A big day in the Tour de France just 3 days in... Iban Mayo, one of the top two contenders against Armstrong, crashed and, due to a couple team mistakes, couldn't get back to the peloton and lost 3 minutes. He's virtually out of the race already. It's poetic justice too.... last year, Iban Mayo [went against the unwritten rules and attacked after Armstrong crashed](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/07/001582.php) last year.
