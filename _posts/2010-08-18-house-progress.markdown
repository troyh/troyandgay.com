Gay went into Seattle for a doctor's appointment and a hair appointment, then met the lighting guy at the house so he could provide an estimate to do the lighting design. She also went back to Albert Lee for more info on appliances so we could make our final decisions on those.

The asbestos abatement people finished on Monday so the house is asbestos-free and they're taking up the hardwood floors from the basement. The floor in the basement has two levels, differing by 2 inches. We are going to level the floor by adding a layer of concrete to the low part so the hardwood floor has to be removed. The hardwood flooring is mostly in good shape with a nice patina and should be able to be used for something else. The tile flooring in the attic has been removed leaving decent fir flooring that we can refinish.
