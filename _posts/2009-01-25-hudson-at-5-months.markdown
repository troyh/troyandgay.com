Hudson at "4 months":http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/12/25/hudsons-4-months-old/, "3 months":http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/11/25/hudson-is-3-months-old/, "2 months":http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/10/25/hudsons-two-months-old/ and "1 month":http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/09/25/hudson-at-1-month/. Funny that most of those photos are taken while he's sitting in his Bumbo. It shouldn't be long before he outgrows that.
