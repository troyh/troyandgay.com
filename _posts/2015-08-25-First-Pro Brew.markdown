There's been weeks of delays to get to the first brew day but today we did it. I love that it happened to be on Hudson's birthday, so I can refer to our first beer we brewed as "Hudson Ale", which is his name.

This beer won't be sold, it's just a test of the brewhouse and, by testing the beer for bacteria over the next several days, a test of our sanitary practices. We'll also move it through all the tanks to "pickle" them before they get real beers in them. 

The brew went well without any catastrophes but it was a long day. We started at 7:30am and left the brewery at 7:30pm. We need to tighten up the routine and get it down to 6-8 hours. We were also interrupted several times by the contractor to make decisions â€“ I am looking forward to the peaceful brews when construction is complete.
