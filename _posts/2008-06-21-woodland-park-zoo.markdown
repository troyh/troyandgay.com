We took Havana to the "Woodland Park Zoo":http://www.zoo.org today. She wasn't much interested in the animals, though, she just stared at them. I guess she's still too young. After the park, we tried to go to the "74th Street Ale House":http://www.seattlealehouses.com/74th/default.htm which is just down the street from the Zoo, but no one under 21 is allowed in (idiotic law). So we went to "Tangletown":http://www.elysianbrewing.com/tangletown.html, one of "Elysian Brewery's":http://www.elysianbrewing.com/ three restaurants, for a mediocre dinner.
