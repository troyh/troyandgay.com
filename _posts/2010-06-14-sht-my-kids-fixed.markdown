This is one my favorite sites: [Shit My Kids Ruined](http://shitmykidsruined.tumblr.com/). I can relate. But I have to give my kids some credit. A few months ago our digital camera suddenly stopped working with the infamous "[Lens Error. Restart camera.](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=safari&rls=en&q=canon+powershot+sd750+lens+error+restart+camera&revid=1403638925&sa=X&ei=g1IWTOeFLdfjnQfK8ZmPDA&ved=0CFsQ1QIoAA)" message -- the lens gets stuck and won't retract. We tried [the best instructions we could find](http://camerarepair.blogspot.com/2007/12/fixing-lens-error-on-digital-camera.html) but couldn't fix it. It was out of the warranty period so I bought a replacement camera for Mother's Day and we let the kids have the broken one to play with -- they love playing with things that have buttons. A couple days later I found it on the living room floor with the lens retracted. How'd they do that? No amount of pushing on it could get it to go back in for me. I decided to put the battery back in and see if it was fixed and it worked! _How'd they do that??!_ Now we have two functioning cameras. Thanks kids!
