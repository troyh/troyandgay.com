I've noticed a clicking in the elliptical machine for the last couple weeks so I decided to open it up and see what the problem is. I found a broken piece of steel in the left crank arm. That must mean my legs are stronger than steel!

I zip-tied the broken piece to keep it from moving so I can keep using it. This machine has been a big part of my life for almost 8 years but it's time to retire it and get a new one.

Update: the very next run broke it for good. The bolt on the other side of the arm snapped while I was running â€” surprised I didn't get hurt.
