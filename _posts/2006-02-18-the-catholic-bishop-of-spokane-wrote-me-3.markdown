I did attend Catholic school in Spokane.  I'm impressed they tracked me down.  The Catholic Diocese of Spokane is using Bankruptcy protection (don't be fooled the Church is a corporation) to put a quick limit on the people who might come forward with sexual abuse charges, and conveniently, a corporation in bankruptcy protection does not have to suffer the embarrassment of damning testimony at trial.  [However, the strategy is backfiring.  The bankruptcy court has determined that all of the parishes are considered property of the Diocese](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002811879_webspokanesettlement17.html?syndication=rss), that means they can be forced to sell the churches and everything in them to pay off the claims.

Godspeed to the claimants.
