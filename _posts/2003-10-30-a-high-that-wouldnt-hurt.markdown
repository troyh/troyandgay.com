[The NYTimes asks all sort of people (William Gibson to Margaret Cho) what technology or invention they would like](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/30/technology/circuits/30idea.html?ex=1374638400&en=1179f2a57a810ed1&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND) to see.  Most ideas are pretty far out (Trump wants a chip in his contractors heads so they can understand his every desire) or practically around the corner (one gadget to replace 15 phones/computers/pdas, TiVo To Go, etc.).  [Moby is the only one with a truly innovative (and possible) idea](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/30/technology/circuits/30moby.html?ex=1374638400&en=1179f2a57a810ed1&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND): design a recreational drug that doesn't hurt, i.e. not bad for you, and not addictive. "We wouldn't become a nation of addicts, because addiction would be impossible."
