Havana and Eva had doctor's appointments so we went to the house so I could do some work while they went to the doctor in the afternoon. The day started bad with traffic on the West Seattle Bridge, I-99 and I-5 so we drove south to avoid it, Eva started crying and we took the long route to the house. Once we got to the house, the work I had to do did not go well. Because we moved the ladder rack from the position we were originally going to install it, all the wires were on the wrong side of a radiator pipe bracket. We couldn't temporarily move the bracket, so I had to pull all the wires out, re-route them around the bracket and then put them back. Simple idea, but it turned into a mess. The wires all became tangled because there wasn't enough room to spread them out. Me, Mark and later, a Schuchart/Dow intern spent a couple hours straightening them all out. That's about all I got done all day, so it was frustrating.

While I kept working, Gay took the kids out to a park and then picked up dinner for us. We sat on the floor upstairs eating our dinner, while I complained about the work I still had to do. We didn't get home until 10:30p and were going back in the next day, hoping for a better day.
