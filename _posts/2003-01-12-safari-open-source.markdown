[Doc Searls on Safari's open-sourceness](http://linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6565): _The larger issue for everybody is standards. Among the geeks I talked to at the show there was complete agreement that Safari's open-source code base created a new de facto condition that favors de jure standards. One Apple engineer explained, "Until Tuesday, the de facto standard was IE. That's what developers cared about, and that's what webmasters cared about. Not any more. Now everybody's going to be holding every browser's feet to the standard's fire. If you fork the standards, you fork yourself." Adds James Davidson, "It's no longer game-over for web standards interoperability. You'd better adhere to standards now."_
