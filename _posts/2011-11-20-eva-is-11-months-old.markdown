Eva is 11 months old today. She's still a great baby, only cries when she's hungry or frustrated. She sleeps well and very regularly. And she eats very well — she loves eggs and has no nut allergies.

She's not yet walking on her own but she uses a walker really well in straight lines. She still crawls very quickly amd loves getting around the house. She says "Maaa maaaa" now and laughs all the time.

Hudson and Havana are good baby-sitters too, warning us when she gets near the stairs and blocking her. Hudson really seems to like her; he sits with her and plays with her, hugs her, etc.
