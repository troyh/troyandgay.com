Havana came running out of the house yelling "There's a penguin in the house!". It was 80+ degrees today so we thought the odds of a penguin really being in the house were low so we humored her. Later, Gay went in the house with Havana and Havana showed her the "penguin". It was actually a hummingbird. And Havana learned a new word.
