The school called Gay this morning and told her to pick Hudson up because he fell and cut his chin. He's the "Big Cheese" this week in school and he tripped and fell on the Big Cheese chair, of all things. Gay took him to Children's Hospital. On the way, he was worried that he'd get blood on his Steelers pants and that "stitches" meant they'd use a sewing machine on him.  He got 11 stitches, but is feeling much better tonight, giddy from the pain-killer, in fact.

This is his 2nd case of stitches ([his first](http://troyandgay.com/2010/03/11/hudsons-first-stitches/) was almost 4 years ago). Havana has had 1. Eva zero, so far. Me, zero in 44 years (knock on wood). They must've inherited an aptitude for injury from Gay.
