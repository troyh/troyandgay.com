Today they took DE "Bruce Davis":http://www.nfl.com/draft/profiles/bruce-davis?id=1695, OT "Tony Hills":http://www.nfl.com/draft/profiles/tony-hills?id=258 -- finally an offensive lineman!, QB "Dennis Dixon":http://www.nfl.com/draft/profiles/dennis-dixon?id=748, LB "Mike Humpal":http://www.nfl.com/draft/profiles/mike-humpal?id=1367 and FS "Ryan Mundy":http://www.nfl.com/draft/profiles/ryan-mundy?id=4393.

They took 3 offensive players and 4 defensive players. All seem like good picks and everyone seems to be excited about Rashard Mendenhall. But don't they know they need to improve their offensive line? As one commenter I saw said after they picked a QB, "they've just added another tackling dummy."
