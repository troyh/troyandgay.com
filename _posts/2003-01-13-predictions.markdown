One of my [2003 predictions](http://fumweb/MT/archives/001153.html#001153) has already been determined:  #6. Apple will ship Chimera as their own browser.





I wasn't 100% right, but I was close... they announced Safari which is their own browser but it's not Chimera, it's built around KHTML and not Mozilla. Surprising.
