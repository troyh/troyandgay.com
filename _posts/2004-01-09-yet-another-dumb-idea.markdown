I talked about [dumb cooking/computer ideas](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/11/001834.php) in November. Now, here's [a net-enabled refrigerator/oven](http://tmio.com/). I guess this is geared towards people who only eat casseroles. And casserole-eaters who have so much free time in the morning to prepare their casserole for the evening but just can't spare 40 minutes in the evening after work to turn the oven on and to wait for it to cook. Tech companies just don't understand cooking, why do we get so many dumb ideas and why do VCs fund them?!
