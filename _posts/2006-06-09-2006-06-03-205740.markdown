Last Saturday, we had Mark, Lee, Eric, Megan and Jon over for dinner. We finally got the chance to drinkn this 3-liter bottle of wine we bought at a charity event last year and the rest of [my beer](http://troyandgay.com/?p=3172) was finished too.

Summer in Seattle is great for eating outside, but Vashon, being an island, is several degrees cooler than the city and more windy too, so it's rare to get a nice evening outside. Patio heaters are a necessity.
