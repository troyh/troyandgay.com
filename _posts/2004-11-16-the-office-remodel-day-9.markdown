After a couple days of no work done, they returned today for a fury of work ... that lasted three hours. The drywall tape and mud has been put on and is drying. Supposedly, they do two (or three?!) coats, so it's still a couple more uneventful days.

We've come to the realization that our hope of having it complete by Thanksgiving is shot. And I'm not confident it'll be done by Christmas either at this rate, even if we do get the flooring decided, ordered and delivered in time.
