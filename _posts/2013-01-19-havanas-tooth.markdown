Havana lost her first tooth. It's been loose for weeks and she's been waiting and waiting for it to come out. Until last night, when it was just barely staying in. She became so worried that she'd do what a friend did and swallow it that she was in tears. But it held on until lunch today when she bit into an apple and out it came. She was very proud of herself.
