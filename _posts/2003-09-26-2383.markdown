I downloaded the entire new [Belle & Sebastian](http://www.belleandsebastian.co.uk/home/) album the other day and have been listening to it ever since (I even got the artwork!). The CD is not even available yet and won't be for another two weeks. To pay for it, I have to wait for the recording industry to manufacture plastic discs and cases, print some paper inserts, wrap them in plastic, work out the distribution deals, do market-planning and then ship them to the stores. In an hour, I had the entire album and I _still_ can't pay the artists for the music I'm enjoying. The industry is the obstacle rather than the facilitator.
