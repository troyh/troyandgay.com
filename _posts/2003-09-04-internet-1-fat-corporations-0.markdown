[Universal Music](http://rss.com.com/2100-1027_3-5071138.html?part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news) has announced that they are dropping the cost of CDs from $17-19 to $13 to "drive music fans back into retail stores". The music industry is _finally_ getting the message that Napster/Gnutella/Kazaa sent. Anyone who downloaded music on the internet should pat themselves on the back. And if you didn't, be sure to give the sales clerk a $4-6 tip on each CD you buy.

I think CD prices should be under $10, actually, and this is just one company. But this is a promising start!
