On our way to the house, we stopped to pick up lunch at Bakery Nouveau, our new favorite bakery, in West Seattle. We met the interior designers at the house to talk about some things as well as with the tile guy who had some questions for the designers and us about tile details in the bathrooms. We also walked through the basement electrical switches and outlet locations with the electrician.

The plumbers were also there continuing their work and the last of the attic rafters were going into place. After that, we went to Gay's baby doc for the weekly checkup.
