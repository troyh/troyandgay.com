[Dave Winer](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/08/23#When:8:09:25AM) believes that taking snippets of text and sorting them in reverse chronological order on a web page will save the world: "_Eventually the world will be run with weblogs, much the way it's run with telephones today. My belief is that when you find a technology of this stature, you deploy as quickly as possible, without worrying. It could be that weblog technology would avert the next international crisis, or deal with its aftermath, more effectively._"
