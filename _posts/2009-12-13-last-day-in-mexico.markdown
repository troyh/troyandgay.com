We got a baby-sitter in the morning to entertain the kids so we could relax by the pool on our last day. After their afternoon naps, we took the golf cart over to the resort to go to the beach and walk around.

Our place was next to the resort but we're not supposed to be in the resort and we eventually were chased out by the security guard. I don't know why, nobody was there so we weren't bothering anyone. Security guards tend to take their jobs too seriously. After the kids went to bed, we had a dinner by ourselves for a change.

I've had enough of the heat and sun. I'm ready to get back to Seattle, which has been in the 30s all week and to get ready for Christmas.
