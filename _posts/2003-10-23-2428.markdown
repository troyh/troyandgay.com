I took pictures during my bike ride this morning. Today was a great morning, it was quiet, I wasn't too hot or cold while riding, the fresh air smelled like wintergreen, I could smell fires in chimneys burning and the sun was peaking out behind the clouds.

These were taken with the camera on my [Nokia 3650](http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,2273,00.html) cell phone, so they're not the greatest quality, but they're good enough.

15 miles in 65 minutes. Yes, I'm slow, but it's hilly.
