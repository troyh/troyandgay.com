It took us 2.5 years to have a party in the new house. The kids had a baby-sitter and we thought they'd play upstairs but they stayed at the party until they went to bed at 10pm, meeting guests and Havana spent some time opening the door and greeting people with "welcome to the party". The last people left at 1:30am.

Megan and Jon came back the next morning to nurse their hangovers, eat the leftover food and watch football.
