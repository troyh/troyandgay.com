Interesting [story](http://www.linuxworld.com/2003/0314.petreley.html) about how Windows' marketshare is overestimated and Linux's marketshare is underestimated (and it's gotta be similar for the Mac). I don't know how true that is, but the facts are pretty clear: Linux has the momentum and any developer today investing in Windows skills is making a career-ending move. I remember when a developer had better know Windows to have a future, but today that's simply not the case.  If a developer is learning [C#](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/techinfo/articles/upgrade/Csharpintro.asp) and not [Java](http://java.sun.com/) or [PHP](http://php.net) or learning .Net and not [XML-RPC](http://xmlrpc.org)/[SOAP](http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/), or an IT person is learning Windows administration and not Linux administration they're gonna have a hard time in a few years finding work.
