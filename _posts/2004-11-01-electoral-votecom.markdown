This shocked me... the guy who runs "Electoral-Vote.com":http://www.electoral-vote.com/ announced who he was today and he is none other than _the_ "Andrew Tanenbaum":http://www.electoral-vote3.com/info/votemaster-faq.html! All computer science students know who he is (or, they should!) -- he's the author of a couple textbooks on operating systems and is the creator of "Minix":http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/minix.html#whatisminix, the precursor to Linux. Small world. :)

And I love his reason for making Electoral-Vote.com: _"In a nutshell, because living abroad I know first hand what the world thinks of America and it is not a pretty picture at the moment. I want people to think of America as the land of freedom and democracy, not the land of arrogance and blind revenge. I want to be proud of America again."_

Me too. Vote tomorrow!
