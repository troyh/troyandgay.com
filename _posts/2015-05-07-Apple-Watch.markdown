Ask me what time it is!

![Title](/img/IMG_5713.JPG)

On April 9, at about 10pm, I realized that Apple was taking pre-orders at midnight – I hadn't paid much attention to all the news and hype so I assumed it'd go on sale at 10am, as usual – so I stayed up late.  I placed my order at 12:03am by my watch. The confirmation email came at 12:06:58am. The exact time to the second is significant, I later realized. The delivery estimate was May 13-27. Ouch, Apple must've grossly underestimated the demand to sell out of them in just a few minutes, especially considering it went on sale at 3am on the east coast!

It took them almost 2 weeks of shipping to churn through the first 7 minutes of sales, at least for the model I ordered. I watched [a forum thread on MacRumors](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1870546&page=143) as people documented their order times to the second and their shipping status while others tracked UPS flights from China to Kentucky. They figured out that the order status changes an hour after UPS flights land in Kentucky. Crazy.

Mine arrived today. The first thing I noticed is how much lighter it is than my old [Citizen](http://www.citizenwatch.com/en-us/) watch, and also much more comfortable. It's less bulky than I was expecting too. It looks thick in the photos but it doesn't feel thick when wearing it.

So far, I love it. It's taking some getting used to using. For example, it took me a long time to figure out how to change the watch faces. As always with Apple products, it's incredibly well-designed, well-thought-out and the fit and finish is unlike any other electronics product.

My first desktop computer in 1980 had 16KB of memory. Today, my *watch* has 6GB, or 375,000 times as much. I haven't seen a benchmark to compare the [6502](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) in my first computer to the watch's processor but it is probably at least that much faster. [Moore's Law](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) wasn't optimistic enough!

When it arrived at 3pm it had 74% battery power. At 11pm, after playing with it quite a bit all day, it was down to 10%. Battery life on a typical day's usage should be fine. The only downside to it so far is that I have to take it off at night to charge it.

# 2nd day

At 6am, starting at 100% battery power, I used it to workout, so it was running the workout app monitoring my heart rate for an hour. The rest of the day I used it as I expect that I'd normally use it plus I used it twice to navigate while driving on two ~15-minute trips. It was down to 60% by 1pm and I felt like I had to use it as little as possible. By 11pm, the battery was at 20%.

The Maps app for navigation is good but the text should be bigger so it's easier to glance at while driving. Since it requires an iPhone, while driving I'll just use my iPhone which can read the directions to me instead and I can keep the phone charging at the same time if necessary. I think the watch would be better for walking where you want the phone to stay in your pocket and not talking to you.

In 5 years, I think people will be surprised we used to wear watches that could only tell us the time.
