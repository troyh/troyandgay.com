My parents live in Ocala, Florida and they have a new neighbor: [John Travolta](http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031102/NEWS/311021090/1010/REALESTATE) and a house with parking for _two_ jets. How did John Travolta get so rich? From what I can tell, he's had two hit movies in his career. Don't you need billions to own jets?
