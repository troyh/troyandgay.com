Yesterday was Gay's birthday. After going to Havana's parent-teacher conference, we went out to lunch at [Sam's Tavern](http://samstavernseattle.com/) and had beers and very good burgers. Tonight, Gerene stayed with the kids and had Hudson's friend, Preston, and Havana's friend, Cameron, over while we went to Ballard (via [Uber](https://www.uber.com/cities/seattle)). We put our name in at [The Walrus And the Carpenter](http://thewalrusbar.com/) for a 2-3 hour wait and walked down the street to [The Noble Fir](http://www.thenoblefir.com/), then to [Urban Family Public House](http://www.urbanfamilypublichouse.com/)and then to dinner back at The Walrus and the Carpenter.
