I can't remember whose blog I spotted this on now, but it really is so delightful I have to pass it on.  Not only can you click on each of those little spots and see the beautiful snowflake created by someone in the world, you can [create your own unique snowflake](http://www.popularfront.com/seasonsgreetings/) in the easiest flash user interface I have *ever* encountered.  It will make you want to make hot cocoa.
