My friend Steve's friend Bill sent out (by way of our friend Terri) this very helpful "legend" to the "what to do in case of attack" brochure at [Ready.gov](http://www.ready.gov).  There must be a design company somewhere that specializes in the "emergency instructions in the back of airline seats".

Don't get so preoccupied with biological weapons that you forget to put on deodorant.
