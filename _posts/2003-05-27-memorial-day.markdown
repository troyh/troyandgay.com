Got a new [power blower/vac](http://www.stihlusa.com/blowers/BG85.html) yesterday rather than fix the one that was on its last legs. The driveway and patio will never be dirty again!

I have a fairly unique last name, Hakala, but I've run into a couple other unrelated Hakalas in the past, but yesterday I met David Hakala who lives on Vashon. He sold me the blower at the hardware store. Odd, eh?

Yesterday I spent barely any time at all on the computer. I have a hard time staying away from the computer for more than a few hours and the first thing I do in the morning is check the performance graphs of [the site](http://recipezaar.com) just to ease my mind that nothing bad happened during the night. I can also check the statistics on my cell phone, but I don't see the pretty graphs I do on the computer. It's an addiction.
