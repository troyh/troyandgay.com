My favorite section in The Book of Lists was the list of [unique names for specific herds](http://www.hintsandthings.co.uk/kennel/collectives.htm), e.g. "a murder of crows", "a parliament of owls", "a prickle of porcupines" etc..  Finally a [collection of funny town names](http://www.infoplease.com/spot/wackytowns.html).
