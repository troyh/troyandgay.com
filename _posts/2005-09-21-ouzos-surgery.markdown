[![Ouzo after surgery](http://static.flickr.com/25/45428747_1be055b242_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/45428747/)Ouzo's lousy first parents didn't have his duclaws removed when he was a puppy, so he's had lots of trouble with them. A couple days ago, Ouzo tore one of them on his hind leg. So today was his surgery to have his rear duclaws removed. He's back home and very groggy, which, if you know Ouzo, is strange.

We'll see how long his bandages last before he chews them off. My guess is that they're gone tomorrow afternoon.
