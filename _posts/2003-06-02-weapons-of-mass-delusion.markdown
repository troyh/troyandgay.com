[Wither the Weapons?](http://slate.msn.com/id/2083760/).  We were sold the Iraq war on the basis that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.  So where are they?  Either they won't be found because they don't exist (not since 95 when we destroyed them the last time around) or because, as some are incredulously arguing now, the Iraqis destroyed them.  The latter proves only the threat of war was necessary to get Saddam to disarm; while the former proves we either shouldn't have gone to war, or the American people were persuaded on a lie.  If the peace movement wants to succeed in the future, their greatest task is ahead of them now.  DO NOT SHUT UP UNTIL THE WEAPONS ARE FOUND.
