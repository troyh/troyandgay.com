[Short Port Report - How the West Coast port shutdown could ruin Christmas. By Daniel Gross](http://slate.msn.com/?id=2071878)


Can you believe it is over bar code scanners?  They want to improve the paper process by using scanners and the Union laborers who are paid $85k/year at the LOW level are pissed because they bar code contract will probably employ their own non-union laborers.  Frankly, they port owners are right to lock out over a slow down, but perhaps they should just fire the union over it.
