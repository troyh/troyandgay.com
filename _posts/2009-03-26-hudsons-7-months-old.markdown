Hudson is 7 months old today. He's been teething a lot lately and needing teething gel so his first tooth is probably imminent. He can turn over and do 360Â°s pretty easily but he's not yet crawling. He's still very quiet and laid-back. When he's really upset he makes noises and most people think he's just trying to talk, but we know that he's angry and either needs a diaper-change, he's hungry or bored.
