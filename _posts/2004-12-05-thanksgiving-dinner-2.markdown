I never posted about our second Thanksgiving dinner we had the Saturday after [Thanksgiving](http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2953). Gay cooked all day Friday and Saturday. Eric, Steve, Steve ("Biff") and Renuka and baby Owen, Mark, Lee and Mark's parents, visiting from Minnesota, came over. Steve made sweet potatoes and Mark brought Pumpkin Pie. Biff made the mashed potatoes. And I took pictures, but only of food.
You can get [all the recipes we made for Thanksgiving in Gay's cookbook at Recipezaar](http://www.recipezaar.com/mycookbook/book/30270/).
