I don't enjoy movie theaters so I haven't been to a movie in years. Today that streak ended. Havana and Hudson don't have school this week so today, while Eva was at her preschool, we took them to see the Lego movie at Pacific Place. It wasn't Pixar good, but it was entertaining and I like the "ignore the rules and be creative" moral.
