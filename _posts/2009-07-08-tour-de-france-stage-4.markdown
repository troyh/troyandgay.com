Today was the team time trial and, as expected, Astana won by 40 seconds, exactly the time difference between Armstrong and Cancellara. So they have the same time starting Stage 5 but Cancellara is still in yellow by a few hundredths of a second. Four of the top 5 positions in the race are Astana riders. I've never seen a team so dominant. It'd be amazing to see all three podium finishers from the same team, I don't think that's ever been done before.

Ben Stiller is now [hanging around Lance](http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/36958130.html) and was allowed to be a podium girl and put the yellow jersey on Cancellara after the stage.
