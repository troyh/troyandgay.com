Had take-out dinner from Express Cuisine for the first time and then watched [One Hour Photo](http://www.foxsearchlight.com/onehourphoto/). Why is it that Robin Williams, a "comedian", is lousy at comedy but great in dramatic roles? From [Awakenings](http://www.hollywood.com/movies/detail/movie/168072) to [Insomnia](http://dontcloseyoureyes.warnerbros.com/) to this movie, he's just great. Who takes photos on film these days, though?
