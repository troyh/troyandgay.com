Saw [Orange County](http://www.orangecountymovie.com/) last night. This must be one of the shortest movies ever made at 77 minutes. It was okay, somewhat funny, but always entertaining. [Jack Black](http://www.caaien.com/jackblack/) was funny as usual. But I recommend the DVD as it has extras that are almost funnier than the movie, especially the "interstitials". The "Advanced English" class that discusses literature in terms of Hollywood is classic Los Angeles.

Teacher: "Can anyone name an important figure in Romeo & Juliet"
Student: "Claire Daines"
Teacher: "Claire Daines. Good."

Teacher: "Today we will discuss the classics. Can anyone name a classic?"
Student: "Smells like teen spirit?"
Teacher: "Nirvana. Good classic."

Sean: "I thought this class was advanced English"
Teacher: "Am I speaking French, Sean?"
