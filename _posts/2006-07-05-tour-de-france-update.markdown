The top European contender for the win, Valverde, crashed yesterday in Stage 3 and broke a collarbone and is out of the race. American Fred Rodriguez crashed too and has abandoned with the same injury.
This leaves Iban Mayo as the top contender against the Americans Hincapie, Landis and Leipheimer. It's a long race yet, but I'm starting to imagine Americans taking 1, 2 and 3!
