Another sidetrack from [our vacation](http://troyandgay.com/?p=3103), here is my favorite piece of art from the [Pompidou Center](http://www.cnac-gp.fr/Pompidou/Accueil.nsf/tunnel?OpenForm) in Paris. It's a "body transit case". :)  I love it not simply because it was so well-made it looks like it was actually manufactured, but because it couldn't possibly be made. We ship everything, including many living things, but never a human. Why not? I don't know, we just can't. It's brilliant. The usual icons for "This side up", "Don't get wet" and "Fragile" are included, of course.

You'll notice the two vents where the person's face would be, but what's not pictured is a third vent on the bottom. The artist thought of everything. :)
