The US Govt [recommends against using Internet Explorer](http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B7D91FC13-9FA9-4703-B000-10000DAA78DD%7D&siteid=google&dist=google). Will people listen? Nope. But when they raise the terror threat warning, people buy duct tape. Go figure.

Use [Firefox](http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/) or [Mozilla](http://mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/). Not only are they more standards-compliant, less buggy, have more capabilities such as pop-up-blocking and tabbed-browsing, and faster than IE, they're safer.

But I have noticed that IE has dropped from ~92% marketshare on Recipezaar to 85% in the last several months. Maybe one day we can stop working around the bugs in IE.
