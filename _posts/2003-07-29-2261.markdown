If there was any doubt that the Pentagon enjoys death and destruction, their [organized betting](http://www.policyanalysismarket.org/index.html) on terrorist attacks proves it. I'm sure this is just the DoD's way of insulting the CIA & FBI because, for some reason, they all hate each other, but to actually defend it is even dumber. Now, [they're going to stop it](http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/07/29/terrorist.market.ap/index.html), at least stop it from being public. Government at work.

[William Gibson makes a good point](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2003_07_01_archive.asp#105950543265868558), though: "The last time DARPA got too imaginative, we wound up with the Internet. "
