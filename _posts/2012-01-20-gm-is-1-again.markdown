Boy, was I wrong about Obama and GM. [I thought](http://troyandgay.com/2008/11/10/we-should-let-gm-and-ford-die/) giving GM a bailout was going to be a huge mistake. Not only are they surviving, [they've regained the top position](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/business/gm-back-on-top-in-world-automaking.html) in number of cars sold (Volkswagen is #2?!) and all those auto industry jobs were saved. Impressive, especially considering it's only been 2 years. We're all still owners of GM do we still need to be paid back, but it seems possible now. Sometimes government does work.
