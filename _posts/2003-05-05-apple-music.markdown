In just the first week, Apple's Music Store [sold 1 million songs](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2003/may/05musicstore.html). In comparison, the other online music services have sold on the order of thousands or tens of thousands of songs in 6+ months _combined_. This is also impressive given that it's US only and Mac users only. It just goes to show, give people what they want and people will pay for it.
