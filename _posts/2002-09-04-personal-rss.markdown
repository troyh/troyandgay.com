Jon Udell wrote an article (in May) about [Personal RSS Aggregators](http://www.byte.com/documents/s=7181/byt1022183228615/0527_udell.html). It's a good description of how cool RSS is and personal RSS aggregators are the future of news delivery. I just found [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/) which is nice.

Years ago at Stream, I did 3 projects in succession that were all "personal news services" and I was pretty excited about having computers pick news just for you. Back then, it was not very easy since you needed a lot of newsfeeds with a lot of meta info already pulled out, plus, without the , all the transport mechanisms were custom (remember Lotus' NotesNet??). RSS makes it possible with real humans doing the news selection.
