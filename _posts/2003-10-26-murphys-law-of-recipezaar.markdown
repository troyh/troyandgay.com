_Whenever you touch the hardware it will not go as swiftly as planned._

We had planned to move our servers to a new (more easily accessible rack) 50 yards away at [our hosting company, CoLo Centers](http://www.colocenters.com/) yesterday evening, and that didn't work out due to lack of bolts and such, so take 2 was today at 6p.  Four hours later than expected, we were done, and sitting on the ferry dock waiting for the 12:50 ferry (which, also according to the law, left at 1:30), when we got a page that the site had problems.  We opted for home and a prayer that the problem could be solved over water, given the last boat was at 2.  A restart and we are back in business (so far), though I think we have used up tonight's "Fall Back" extra hour and then some....
