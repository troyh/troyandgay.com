[![](http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/images/pj_chair09162002202425.gif)Aeron's getting a better back](http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB1032202408806990395,00.html?mod=home_right_sub_chart_promo_us)

The company is selling the upgrade as a bolt-on feature for $90, so Aeron owners won't have to buy a new $800 chair to get it.
