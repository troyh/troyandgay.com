Illy and Ouzo went to the vet today for the usual up-selling of additional services. Illy was supposed to get a tooth extracted but it turned out to be okay so it wasn't removed. So they both only had a teeth-cleaning. Eight hours later they were home and lethargic as the anesthesia wore off. And I've never seen their teeth so clean. If only they'd brush their teeth more often.
