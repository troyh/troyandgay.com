Just when you think the DC sniper is 3000 miles away, we find out that the FBI has just searched a house in Tacoma: [Feds link Tacoma search to sniper hunt](http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/South/10/23/sniper.shootings/index.html). It sounds like a previous resident of the house did target-practice in the backyard and was in the US Military stationed in Fort Lewis.
