[MoveOn.org](http://www.moveon.org) (an organization founded by average folks in response to frustration with Bill Clinton's impeachment hearings, the lack of congressional resolution, and a desire to get the country focused on real problems) sponsored an amateur video contest:  Make a thirty second spot that best explains what the president's policies are really all about, not just those lame voice over commercials you usually see in political campaigns.  It is a brilliant idea, and the [Bush in 30 seconds](http://www.bushin30seconds.org/index.html) winner is great.  They are now raising money to get the spot played on CNN during the State of the Union address coverage and during the Superbowl -- though so far [CBS says the ad doesn't pass their Standards and Practices committee](http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/sports/2357653), huh?!  They allow White House ads, ads against smoking, other political ads.  PLEASE!

[We gave to the cause, and encourage you to do so too](http://www.moveonvoterfund.org/donate/creditcard.html), if you believe in freedom of speech and would like to see a political ad truly made by the people instead of boring ads made by big dumb political action committees or parties.
