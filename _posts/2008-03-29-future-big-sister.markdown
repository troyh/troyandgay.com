We're expecting a baby boy in August. He and Havana will be just 16 months apart in age. We've compiled a long list of names, but none so far feel right to us.

Havana already has her t-shirt:

It says "Big Sister", but she can't read yet so she doesn't know yet. She knows she has pink "Chucks":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Taylor_All-Stars though -- she's even pointing them out. :)
