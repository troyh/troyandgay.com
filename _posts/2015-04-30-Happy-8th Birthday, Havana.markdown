To start Havana's 8th birthday, we went for brunch at [The Grand Wailea](http://www.grandwailea.com):

Then we went down to the pool. The pool is very cool with caves, waterfalls and several different areas of varying depth joined by waterways. There's also a beach area with sand for the little kids.  Havana quickly met another girl and they spent the morning and afternoon going all around the pool and the slides. She got a bit of a sunburn on her face. Hudson and Eva stayed with us and we stayed in the kids pool area took them down the slides a few times. 

For dinner, we went to a luau:
