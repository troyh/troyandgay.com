Spent a few hours on Sunday cleaning the decks and weeding the back yard as Troy mowed.  I don't know what it is about the soil out here, but the dandelions are HUGE.  Flower/seed stems are at least a foot tall and the plants (not weeds, full-on plants) are more than a foot in diameter.  Satisfying to kill.
