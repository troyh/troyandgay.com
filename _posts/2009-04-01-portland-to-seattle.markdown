We checked out of the hotel in Portland and were on the road home by 10am. We stopped in Dupont, WA for lunch and took the 3pm ferry back to Vashon. A total of 1800 miles of driving, which was 700 less than "last year's drive to California":http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/08/seattle-to-eugene-or/.
