Dinner last night with old friends to celebrate Steve's life change: he's quiting his oppressive job and moving back to Austin, Texas.

Frankly, I was in a similar situation myself along with others who once worked for paper money (stock options).   They don't call them "The Golden Handcuffs" for nothing.  The tragedy is when the potential that they will ever pay off dissolves, and you are left working at an unrewarding job staring at an Excel spreadsheet and waiting.
