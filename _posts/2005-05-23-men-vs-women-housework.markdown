[Men do more housework than women think](http://www.careerjournal.com/columnists/workfamily/20050520-workfamily.html). Women still do more than half, but men's contributions are underestimated. Tell me about it! :)

I generally do the dishes, I do all the regular yardwork and I clean the garage and do all the recycling. I always clean the dog's vomit too even when it's "her dog" that does it. Gay does the majority of daily cooking and always does the laundry (I don't need clean clothes!), though. While I admit Gay does more total work than I do, I do believe my contributions are underestimated. :(
