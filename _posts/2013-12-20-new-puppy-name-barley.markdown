We had the kids each do a secret vote on the names and, along with our votes, the most popular names were "Tank"', "Bam Bam" and "Barley". We asked Lee and Mark, who are visiting us this week from London, and they both liked Barley best. So Barley it is. 

Coincidentally, Mark thought of a name during the night and suggested to me this morning that we name it "Barkley" â€” technically, "Berkeley" after [Berkeley Square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Square) (oddly pronounced "Barkley Square") in London but I prefer to spell words like they sound. I liked it because [Barclay Perkins ](http://www.thrale.com/barclay_and_perkins_company_limited_owner_1781_1955)is the name of an 18th Century English brewer and because of "bark", but it also reminded me of Charles Barkley.
