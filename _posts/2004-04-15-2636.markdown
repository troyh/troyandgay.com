Bin Laden [offers a truce](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/ap/20040415/ap_on_re_mi_ea/egypt_bin_laden_tape) to Europe. Why aren't we in Afghanistan hunting this guy down? Instead, we're spending billions of dollars, hundreds of American lives, thousands of Iraqi lives and years in Iraq installing a democracy that is sure to be overthrown within a week after we leave. Al Qaeda is the real threat to democracy in the middle east, not some egotistical dork in Fallujah.
