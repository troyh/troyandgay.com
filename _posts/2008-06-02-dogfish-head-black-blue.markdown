After brewing, I sat outside and drank Dogfish Head's "Black & Blue":http://www.dogfish.com/brewings/Occasional_Rarities/Black_._Blue/58/index.htm. Gay found this at Esquin, a Seattle wine shop, and it cost $12.99 for a 750ml bottle. That's about $6.50 for a 12 ounce beer, making it the most expensive beer I've ever had, I think.

It's a Belgian-style beer, although it doesn't mention the style on the bottle, and is brewed with blackberries and blueberries. I normally don't like Belgian beers because they put strange ingredients in them. Strange ingredients is Dogfish Head's thing, and I have yet to have a bad beer from them. This one has a slight reddish tint to it and is only slightly sweet, despite the fruit. I really liked it, although not as much as their "Raison D'Extra":http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/24/dogfish-head-raison-dextra/. I tried to share some of it with Gay, but she didn't like it at all. More for me!
