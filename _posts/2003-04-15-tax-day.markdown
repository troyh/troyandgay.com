I haven't paid taxes since the 1999 tax year since my income has always been negative, but this year, with a slightly positive income, I am getting $231 back because of the [Earned Income Credit](http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=96456,00.html). And it's going to be donated to [my favorite charity](http://recipezaar.com).
