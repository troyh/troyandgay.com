After months of our failing to get Eva interested, at 2.63 years old, she started potty-training today using the book _Toilet Training in Less Than a Day_ â€“ even though it was originally published in 1974, it does _not_ advise you to spank your kid until they figure it out. 

She went #1 successfully <del>4</del> <del>5</del> 6 times today, #2 once and no accidents. She is very proud of herself and so are we.
