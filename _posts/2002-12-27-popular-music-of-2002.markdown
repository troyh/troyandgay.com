The #1 and #2 genres of music in the US in 2002 are [rap and country](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/26/arts/music/26HITS.html).  This proves that Americans are mostly stupid rednecks. And boy, what a lousy list of #1 albums throughout the year: _Creed, Alan Jackson, J-Lo remixes!, Alanis Morissette, a K-Tel-style CD of pop remixes (the one we see advertised on TV), Celine Dion, Ashanti, Kenny Chesney, Big Tymers, Musiq, another mix CD from P.Diddy et al, Eminem, Nelly, Dave Matthews Band, Bruce Springsteen, Toby Keith, Dixie Chicks, Elvis Presley best-of (!), Faith Hill, Santana, Jay-Z and Shania Twain_. No kidding, that's the list.  People are buying remix CDs and Best Of CDs too!
