[This is good news](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/22/technology/circuits/22comp.html) about a drop in enrollment in computer science at universities due to the dot-com bust. This is similar to the few years before I started college where enrollment in CS dropped because kids realized they wouldn't be playing video games all day.
