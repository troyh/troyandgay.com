[WSJ.com - Zagat Starts Charging For Access to Its Reviews](http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB1033756830314378193,00.html)

Sounds like they have 750,000 registered members and have 10,000 subscribers in the first week of charging (1.3% in a week is pretty darn good).  Also good: you can still use the database to find restaurants and addresses, but to get access to reviews and price per meal, you've got to fork it over ;-)
