[The NY Times profiles a "robust" writers community website](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/09/technology/circuits/09book.html?ex=1374638400&en=1179f2a57a810ed1&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND) that does "almost 1 million pages/month and has 10,000 members", which is <10% of the traffic and membership that Recipezaar has, and they have been around for about as long as we have.  Will a NY Times writer please call, I'm available all day...
