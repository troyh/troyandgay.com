Had friends over for dinner last night: Megan, her boyfriend John, Serene, Dave, Reid, Eric, Valerie and lots of dogs. Megan & John brought appetizers with her roasted red pepper dip & bruschetta, Serene & Dave brought a great salad and growlers of yummy local micro-beer. Eric & Valerie brought us a bottle of wine straight from France, which we stashed away for later. We barbecued hamburgers and had [Cocoa-Buttermilk Cake](http://www.recipezaar.com/recipe/getrecipe.zsp?id=52840) for dessert.

I woke up at 6am and couldn't get back to sleep (probably a function of the wine). I stayed up til 9am, did some work, and then fell asleep til after noon.
