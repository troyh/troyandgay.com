[Ballmer gets testy](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2001789135_microsoft120.html) with an individual shareholder at their annual shareholders meeting. The shareholder criticized them for hoarding $51 billion in cash and not paying out larger dividends. Ballmer claims they're holding the money to support them in the event that the courts force them to change their business model. That's like a bank robber arguing he needs to keep his loot to hire lawyers because the courts may try to take it away. Here's an idea for Microsoft: stop breaking the law and you won't have to worry about the courts. Here's an idea to the US Government: start enforcing the laws to distribute the ill-gotten gains one company holds to the rest of the industry to create more jobs and improve the economy.
