"This beer":http://www.dogfish.com/brewings/Limited_Edition_Beers/Raison_DExtra/19/index.htm was sitting in the fridge for a couple weeks, I was reluctant to try it because I generally don't like beers with weird ingredients (I'm talking about you Belgium!) and it's a brown ale and I have yet to find a brown ale I like. It's also brewed with raisins and maple sugar so I assumed it'd be cloyingly sweet. But it wasn't... it was definitely sweet, but very well-balanced. And it was especially good in today's sun after mowing the lawn. Unfortunately, I only had one bottle to drink.
