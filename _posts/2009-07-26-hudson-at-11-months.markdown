Hudson is 11 months old today. Since last month, he's cruising very well now and loves to practice walking. We hold his hands and he will walk all around the house and yard and get upset if you want to quit before he does. He  crawls fast and can even start to climb stairs. For eating, he rarely takes food from us anymore and now prefers to take food himself and feed himself. This is a welcome change!
