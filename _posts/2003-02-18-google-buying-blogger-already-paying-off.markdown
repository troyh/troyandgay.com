In response to [Google buying Blogger](http://192.168.0.240/archives/2003/02/001223.php#001223), Dave Winer is [now suggesting](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/02/17#When:7:21:11AM) that we need Google to not own the web search world. Yes, any monopoly is bad in the long-term, even if it is good technology behind it (and I'm not at all convinced that Google is good technology).
