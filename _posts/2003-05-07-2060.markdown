At the Mariners game last night, we found ourselves in a room full of big Seattle  business people and John was anxious to introduce us to many of them. Significantly, we met a woman who was one of the early investors in [HomeGrocer.com](http://www.homegrocer.com/) and acted as the CFO and sat on their board early on. HomeGrocer was destroyed in [the mess that was Webvan](http://news.com.com/2100-1017-269594.html?legacy=cnet). She had some very interesting and quality advice for us. And here I thought we were just going to a baseball game. Life is funny that way.
