A former Defense Dept. employee [reveals the truth about the misleading claims](http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2004/03/10/osp_moveon/) used to create the reason for war.

_Will Americans hold U.S. policymakers accountable? Will we return to our roots as a republic, constrained and deliberate, respectful of others? My experience in the Pentagon leading up to the invasion and occupation of Iraq tells me, as Ben Franklin warned, we may have already failed. But if Americans at home are willing to fight -- tenaciously and courageously -- to preserve our republic, we might be able to keep it._
