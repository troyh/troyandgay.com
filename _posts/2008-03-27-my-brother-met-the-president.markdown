My brother works at "ColorCraft":http://www.colorcraft-va.com/ in Virginia and President Bush "visited yesterday":http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/03/images/20080326-1_p032608cg-0191jpg-515h.html. He shook his hand and got a photograph with him. It'll take a few weeks to get the photograph since the Secret Service doesn't allow bystanders to carry cameras.

I think my brother dislikes the Bush administration even more than I do, but he said this about him:

bq. ...there is no denying the man's personal charisma. He is much different on TV and radio than he is in person. After meeting him, I can see why he has such a following among those that have met him. He is humorous, at ease with all kinds of people, and very personable.

bq. Physically, he is about 5 ft 10 or so. He is actually much thinner than he appears on TV as well
