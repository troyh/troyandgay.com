CNN has [an early look at 's Xbox Live](http://money.cnn.com/2002/10/03/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/index.htm). It sounds pretty cool and I actually believe online gaming is the future, but as the author says, getting people to pay the monthly fee will be difficult. And when has MS ever convinced any consumer to pay them anything? Sounds like another $2 billion down the drain to me. I wonder how Sony's online gaming will do.
