We took a stack of resumés to [Top Pot Doughnuts](http://www.thestranger.com/2003-10-23/chow.html) in Seattle yesterday morning for breakfast and reading the resumés. This is a great place, far more comfy than a Starbucks and free Wi-Fi! I don't know what it is, but having internet access on a laptop sitting in a public place is amazing to me. And whenever you go somewhere that has free Wi-Fi, you see nothing but Mac laptops for some reason (truth be told, there was one PC laptop) even though they have a much smaller percentage of the market. Why is that?
