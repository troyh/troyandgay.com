I think we just had an earthquake here in Bali.

*Update*: It's [confirmed](http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/SP276054.htm), a 5.0 quake hit right near us off the coast. We talked with a couple locals about it and they did feel it too but thought nothing of it since minor quakes hit Bali often. And living in Seattle, quakes are fairly uneventful unless they hit 6.0 (10x more powerful than a 5.0) or more.
