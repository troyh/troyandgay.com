After another appointment in Seattle, we went to dinner at "Quinn's Pub":http://quinnspubseattle.com/. Gay had the steak and I had the burger, both I thought were very good but Gay wasn't as impressed. They had Russian River's Damnation on tap so I couldn't pass that up. Gay had the Speakeasy Double IPA which was less hoppy than you'd expect from a double IPA. They have a nice selection of Belgian beers and because we're going to visit Belgium in a few weeks, we decided to get a Belgian and after recommendations from the waiter, we split the "Achtel Trappist Extra":http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/922/40681 which was very good and went well with the food.

Incidentally, we found [another reference](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/04/26/the-name-hudson/) to "Hudson"... on the menu of dozens of whiskeys there was one called [Hudson Baby Bourbon](http://tuthilltown.com/QUALITY/baby.html) made by Tuthilltown Spirits. And Hudson is a baby (but doesn't taste anything like bourbon). Turns out their whole line of bourbons are named "Hudson". It's supposed to be very good too so I'll have to try to find some.

For dessert, we went to "Molly Moon's":http://www.mollymoonicecream.com/ for ice cream. Gay ordered a "double" of salted caramel (yum!) and Vivace coffee ice cream and discovered that a "double" is almost a pint of ice cream (for only $4.50!) and ended up throwing most of it away! I wisely got the single of "birthday cake" ice cream and balsamic strawberry which was a manageable size.
