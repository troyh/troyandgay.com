Havana has discovered the slide:

See the [video](http://flickr.com/photos/troyh/2533723093/) on Flickr (or click photo above). She likes to crawl up it and in bare feet she can climb almost all the way up it until it gets more steep.

A new word she's learned is "Up" that she uses when she wants to be picked up, helped up onto something or out of her highchair. But she says "Bup". The bottom of the slide is too high for her to get on it (fortunately), so she stands at the bottom, looks at you and says "Bup".
