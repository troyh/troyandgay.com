Not that *the* soundtrack for [this movie](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/07/001550.php#001550) is worth purchasing, just that the movie itself would not be half as good without the sounds track that accompanies it. I really liked this film, but the music pulls together some very wacky scenes and keeps you emotionally involved with some strange charactesr and many David Lynch-style non-sequiturs that are never explained.  Adam Sandler proves himself to have a lot more depth and talent that the sweet naive guy he normally writes for himself.
