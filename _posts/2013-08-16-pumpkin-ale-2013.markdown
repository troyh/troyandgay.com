I love pumpkin beers and Fall is coming fast so I'm brewing 10 gallons of a pumpkin ale. Last year I made [Punkin' Ale](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/f76/punkin-ale-145060/). This year it's my own recipe, and looking at last year's recipe now, mine is similar except I'm using Golden Promise malt as the base, just one charge of Magnum hops for bittering, and I'm adding molasses and using pumpkin in the boil instead of the mash. I plan to serve this on Halloween. Tastes fantastic right now.
