Yet another online grocer, [FreshDirect](http://freshdirect.com) with a [Fortune article](http://www.fortune.com/indexw.jhtml?channel=artcol.jhtml&doc_id=210233) on it. Same model as WebVan but on a smaller scale (Manhattan area only). The founder also founded a grocery store in Manhattan in the early 90s that was known for extremely fresh produce. FreshDirect seems to follow the same model but also has fresh-baked stuff. I do like the little food icons they use. :)
