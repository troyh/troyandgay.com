Today is Hudson's half-birthday, a good excuse for dessert! His school class celebrates half-birthdays for the kids whose birthday occurs during the summer so he had his birthday celebration at school this week too.

He helped to make the peanut butter frosting for his half-cake:

It feels like he just [turned 6](http://troyandgay.com/our%20life/2014/08/25/happy-birthday-hudson-5.html) and now he's halfway to 7 already.
