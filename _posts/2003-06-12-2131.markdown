Had to run into Seattle this morning. My SIM in my cell phone mysteriously died. Nobody can tell me why SIMs suddenly die, but T-Mobile confirms they do. Dropped Gay's car off at the shop to fix a couple recalls we never got around to having done. Lunch at Elliot Bay Brewery, then picked up some new CDs: [Radiohead](http://www.radiohead.com/)'s _Hail To The Thief_, [Grandaddy](http://www.grandaddylandscape.com/)'s _Sumday_ and [Yo La Tengo](http://www.yolatengo.net/)'s _Summer Sun_ before hopping on the ferry home.
