When I used Windows I loved [TextPad](http://www.textpad.com), because it does everything I need for writing code and html for .  Since I've been on the Mac, I've been looking for a replacement.  [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml) Pro does what I need -- though not as elegantly as the simple TextPad -- but $150 seems like a lot to pay for an editor (the free Lite version does not do syntax highlighting).  I thought [Web Design](http://www.ragesw.com/webdesign.php) was the answer but despite Preferences which suggest you can set extensions for appropriate syntax highlighting, I can't get the darn thing to open any file with an extension other than html/xml/php.  Troy uses vi, but I know [this much](http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/02/21/vi_intro.html) about vi, which is just good enough to get my cvs comments in and it drives me nuts.  UPDATE...
<!-- more -->
Email to the creator of WebDesign and I'm provided a workaround within 3 hours and the offer of a private build that will be even easier within a day.  I'm evaluating it for now, but I think it might be my solution.  Meanwhile BBEdit introduces a low end version for a cheaper price point (TextWrangler) but it too misses syntax highlighting.
