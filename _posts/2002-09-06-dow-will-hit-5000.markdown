Motley Fool article, [Fool.com: Bill Gross Negative on Stocks](http://www.fool.com/news/take/2002/mft/mft02090601.htm), historically _stocks do not follow earnings growth, as Peter Lynch says on his commercials. Rather, dividend yields matter most to stock returns._ So, even if corporations do increase earnings in the future (not a sure thing, IMO) the stock market still may not recover. Look for undervalued stocks with a P/E lower than the S&P average P/E of 21.
