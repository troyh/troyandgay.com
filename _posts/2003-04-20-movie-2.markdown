We saw [Personal Velocity](http://www.mgm.com/ua/personalvelocity/) last night. Blah. [Parker Posey](http://www.parkerposey.org/) was good, as usual, but overall not worth watching, in my opinion. I'm surprised it won the Grand Jury Prize at the [Sundance Film Festival](http://festival.sundance.org/index.aspx). There were 2 [iBooks](http://apple.com/ibook/) in it, though.
