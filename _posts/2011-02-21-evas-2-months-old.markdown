Eva is 2 months old today. She's still a great baby, I can't imagine how a baby could be easier. She only cries when she is hungry and, unless it's taking too long, her cries are quiet. Like Hudson, she goes to sleep easily -- no 45-minute struggle like Havana was. And she's almost sleeping through the night already, often only woken up by Havana who still doesn't always sleep through the night.
