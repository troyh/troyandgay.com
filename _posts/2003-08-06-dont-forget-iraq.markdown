I'm irritated that the seven words (or however many there were) are quickly being forgotten.  Please let's not forget that we were led into this war under suspicious circumstances, we are not accomplishing our goals there, and Americans are dying.  An interesting analysis piece in Slate argues that [we do not have 1/4 of the troops necessary to successfully restore Iraq](http://slate.msn.com/id/2086636/).

_"The highest levels of casualties have occurred in the operations with the lowest levels of U.S. troops." In fact, he adds, "Only when the number of stabilization troops has been low in comparison to the population"혰such as in Somalia, Afghanistan, and now Iraq혰"have U.S. forces suffered or inflicted significant casualties." By contrast, in Germany, Japan, Bosnia, and Kosovo혰where troop levels were high혰Americans suffered no postwar combat deaths._
