Rush Limbaugh [admits to being a drug addict](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/ap/20031011/ap_on_re_us/limbaugh_painkillers). As someone who has been outspoken on the enforcement of the drug laws, shouldn't he willingly go to jail? We prosecute almost [30,000](http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/glance/fedtyp.htm) people a year in the US for drug offenses. Let's see if the Bush DoJ will prosecute this admitted felon even though he's a fat, rich, white Republican.
