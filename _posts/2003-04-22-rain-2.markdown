It seems like the nice days of Spring are over in Seattle. Yesterday it was pouring rain and today is not looking promising. I need to get out and ride my bike too!

**Update:** Mid-afternoon it cleared up and the sun came out. Went for a 45-minute ride at 4:30. Uneventful, but it was nice to be out.
