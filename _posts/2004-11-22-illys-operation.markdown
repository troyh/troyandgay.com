We dropped Illy off at the vet this morning to have a mole removed from her lip. She developed it this summer and on her last checkup, the vet recommended that it be removed. We just got back from picking her up. She's groggy from the anesthesia, but otherwise looks great. Ouzo doesn't seem to care that she's back home.
