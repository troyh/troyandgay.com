"Debian":http://debian.org is 11 years old "today":http://ianmurdock.com/archives/000230.html. We are still in the process of switching all our servers from Red Hat to Debian. I'm thankful for Debian, and especially for "apt":http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch1.en.html, which has made installs and updates trivial, which is necessary when you have a lot of servers.
