![santassm.jpg](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/santassm.jpg)Recipezaar members invent lots of fun games, and recently I took part in one of their "swaps".  This was a [Salt & Pepper Shaker Swap](http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=44931) where people all over the world paired up and sent each other shaker sets.  I got these jaunty holiday shakers from [Jan S](http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=29196) in Australia.  Getting these surprise packages (they also do food swaps and ornaments and more) is so much fun, and I'm so excited to be growing the collection of shakers I recently inherited from my grandmother.
