My Dry Irish Stout carbonated just in time for St. Patrick's Day. I made it 4 weeks ago, a simple classic recipe but with 7.5% chocolate malt. It came out as a dry bitter coffee-ish and roasty stout, quite good to me. The OG was 1.044 and the FG is 1.010 so it's a session-able 4.46% ABV, perfect for International Drinking Day.
