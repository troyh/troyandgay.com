Americans spent $1.5 billion on lottery tickets just for this one. 25% of that, $375 million, pays for government services. 44 states participate, so on average, my state received $8.5 million. With a population of 6.8 million, I receive $1.25 in government services for free. Even better, [Americans spend $56 billion](http://m.cbsnews.com/storysynopsis.rbml?pageType=eveningNews&catid=57407364&feed_id=29) on lottery tickets every year, or 37 times as much, so I receive an estimated $46.25 in government services every year without spending a penny. That's $231.25 for my family each year. Thank you lottery players, keep it up!
