We did yard work today. It's nice to take a break from computers and do work that is more physical. I got to use [my chainsaw](http://www.husqvarna.com.au/node266.asp) again and cut off some big branches off some maple trees in the yard. On Christmas Day last year a huge tree fell down in our yard so I had to learn about chainsaws, buy one and go cut it up. That was a lot of work, but now I look forward to chainsawing. Is there anything chainsaws can't do?! :)
