We've decided to postpone the new site design until next week so that we don't kill ourselves to get it out by this weekend, especially since I (we) won't be working tomorrow at all in celebration of my birthday. The new design is so significant that it's best to sit on it internally for a little while. Plus, there are some serious bugs (with reviews and review notifications) on the existing site that need to be fixed.
