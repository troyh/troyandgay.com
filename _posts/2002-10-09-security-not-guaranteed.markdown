[Microsoft wants money](http://rss.com.com/2100-1001-961351.html?type=pt&part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news) to build secure products. They're backtracking on Mundie's poorly-worded statements, but the point is that software companies will never guarantee security or reliability because they just can't. This is why open source is no worse than closed source in this respect, contrary to what  has been saying, i.e., that customers require a company to "stand behind" their product.
