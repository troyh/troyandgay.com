[CNET.com](http://news.com.com/2100-1001-956496.html?tag=fd_top):
_For those that have recently purchased new Linux servers, 31 percent were adding capacity, 31 percent were replacing Windows systems, 24 percent were replacing Unix and 14 percent were replacing other operating systems._. In other words, of the people buying Linux to replace another OS, 45% are replacing Windows. This is contrary to previous reports that Linux was replacing Unix exclusively.
