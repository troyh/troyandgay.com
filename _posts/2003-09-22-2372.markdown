Last night we went to the [Vashon Allied Arts auction](http://vashonalliedarts.org/auction.html). Auctions are great, they give you all the wine and beer you can drink, kinda like casinos. Gay won an auction for a photograph and I bought a painting. And then Gay and her mom danced into the wee hours of the evening. (I don't dance).

Left Seattle this morning and arrived in Spokane this afternoon after missing two ferries from Vashon. Went out to Gay's family's home for dinner and then to [Hotel Lusso](http://www.slh.com/usa/spokane/hotel_spolus.html), which has [WiFi](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Wi_Fi.html) throughout.
