[![letour2003.gif](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/letour2003.gif)](http://letour.fr/) Nothing interesting in the Tour today. No changes in the overall, but Alessandro Petacchi won his 3rd (!) stage in a sprint finish (he won 6 in the Giro d'Italia). We're witnessing a new [Mario Cipollini](http://www.mariocipollini.net/principale.asp).

The real excitement is going to happen in [Stage 8](http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/sport1/shared/spl/hi/cycling/03/tour_de_france/html/8.stm) on Sunday.
