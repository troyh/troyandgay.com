Having Elysian's 11th Beer of the Apocalypse: Mortis, a sour persimmon ale. We picked it up on [Monday](http://troyandgay.com/2012/11/26/lunch-with-havana/). Probably my favorite label of the series.

They say its fermented with only Brettanomyces so I was expecting a very sour beer. The sourness is only on the front end. I don't taste any persimmon but that's likely because I don't know what a persimmon tastes like.
