This is hardly news to people who bothered to look at the last 50 years of stock market history or were alive for the last 20 years to watch the Bushies kill our economy and Clinton revitalize it. Princeton economics professor and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Binder talks about a book that "proves Democrats are clearly better for the economy than Republicans":http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/08/alan-blinder-is-history-siding-with.html. Republicans like to selfishly vote with their pocketbooks and vote Republican simply to lower their taxes (some are even proud of this idea!) but not only are they hurting themselves, they're hurting our country.
