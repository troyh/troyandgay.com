Back in August or September it took us quite a while to design a staircase in the garage that would still let us put a car as big as the Jeep in it. We figured out a design that gave us inches to spare above the hood. It also places you right between the cars rather than on one side of one car. Amazingly enough, what worked on paper also worked in reality.

However, we'll always have to measure any car we want to buy in the future and park in this spot to make sure it fits.
