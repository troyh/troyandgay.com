Richard Clarke makes serious allegations about the quality of our national security during the 9/11 hearings and the Bush Administration's responses have all been to attack the person, not his assertions. And Condoleezza Rice goes on TV to criticize Clarke, but refuses to testify before the committee. We're looking for the truth so we can protect the US in the future. You're either with us or against us, Mr. Bush.
