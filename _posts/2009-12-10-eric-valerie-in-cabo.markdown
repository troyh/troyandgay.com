Eric and Valerie, on their sailing trip from Seattle to France, are docked in [La Paz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Paz,_Baja_California_Sur), relaxing for a month after [a stressful trip](http://blog.mailasail.com/pacificmystic/30) from San Diego.  They took the bus down to Cabo today to meet us. We met at the marina and had dinner.

They stayed at our place Wednesday night. Eric had to fly back to Seattle for a week on Thursday afternoon, so Gay and Valerie drove him to the airport and went shopping while I watched the kids back at the house.
