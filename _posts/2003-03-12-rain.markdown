I flatted twice yesterday on my bike ride due to a worn rear tire. So this morning I swapped the (less-worn) front tire for the rear, opened the garage and it was pouring down rain. Still haven't put the fenders on my bike, so no ride today unless it clears up later. I hate when weather controls your life.
