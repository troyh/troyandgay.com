[The Economist on McCain/Palin](http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12066224): "One of the biggest problems with the Bush administration is that it appointed so many incompetents because they were sound on Roe v Wade. Mrs Palin's elevation suggests that, far from breaking with Mr Bush, Mr McCain is repeating his mistakes."

McCain would rather screw the country than lose an election.
