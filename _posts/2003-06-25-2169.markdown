Has there ever been a more annoying band than [The White Stripes](http://www.whitestripes.com/main.html)?! This band gets no end of praise these days (which usually means they're on their way out already...good!) but never have I heard a band's (and I use the term "band" loosely, they don't even have a bassist) song come on the radio that makes me mute the radio so consistently. Nails on a blackboard.
