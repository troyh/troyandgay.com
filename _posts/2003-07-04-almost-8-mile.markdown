![0936070250.jpg](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/0936070250.jpg) I've been running a lot lately. A "lot" for me is like 5 miles 4 times/week.  I'm trying to throw in a weekly long run of 7 1/2 miles too until that is my regular run -- can you tell there is a 2 1/2 mile loop near my house.  My pace has gone from 10 minute miles to 9 1/2 minute miles over the past 3 1/2 months that I've been running regularly.  So far only 3% body fat loss, but no actual weight loss...slow and steady...I have a couple of (marathon running) gal-neighbors to run with, and they are teaching me [Jeff Galloway's plan](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0936070250/recipezaar-20) (see hokey 70s style book cover on right).  I'd like to run a half-marathon this year.  I figure, I trade my commute time for exercise, and I'm a completely different person that day.  You'd be amazed at how great it feels at 4p to think "I ran 5 miles today."
