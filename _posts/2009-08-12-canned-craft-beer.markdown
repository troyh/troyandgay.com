A slowly-growing trend in craft beer is to package it in cans. 21st Amendment, which [we visited](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/17/21st-amendment-brewpub-review/) in 2008, is one of the few that does this now and we can finally get their beers locally so Gay picked some up recently. I look forward to getting more craft beer in a can -- easier to carry, less prone to breakage, better protection from light and air and more eco-friendly.

This _Brew Free! or Die IPA_ is delicious. We also got their _H__ell or High Watermelon Wheat_, which I'd heard good things about in spite of it being a wheat beer, but I didn't like it at all.
