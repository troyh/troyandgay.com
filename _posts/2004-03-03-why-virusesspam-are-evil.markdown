One of [Recipezaar's](http://www.recipezaar.com) customer service e-mail addresses recently received the following spam messages:



<blockquote>_Dear user of Recipezaar.com,

contain viruses,  in order  to  keep your computer and e-mail account  safe,
please, follow  the  instructions.

Now, of course, I know this didn't happen, because, well Troy/I = Recipezaar, but imagine someone at Earthlink or AOL or some random ISP getting the same message...
