More great lyrics from The National:


<blockquote>Everybody needs a prayer, and needs a friend
Everybody knows the world's about to end

Everybody wants to know what the end will be
Everybody wants to look before they leap

Everybody wants aÂ sip of wine to drink
Everybody wants a little more time to think

Everybody needs a reason why they run
Everybody wants to know what they're running from</blockquote>


Change that "wine" to "beer" and it's even better.
