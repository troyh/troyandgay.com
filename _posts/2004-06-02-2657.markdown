This [article](http://www.seattleweekly.com/features/0422/040602_news_microsoft.php) sums up my feelings almost exactly. Microsoft is not successful today because people love its products, because most people curse Windows and Office daily. They are successful for other reasons, not the least of which was years of infamous business practices. And eventually (and soon) that will come to an end.

When I left, I was pretty loyal to Microsoft, although the truths that the antitrust trial brought out left a bad taste in my mouth. But since then I've also discovered how wonderful OS X is and how useful Linux is. Although neither are perfect (yet), I live the life I dreamed about when I was 12. I like computers again.
