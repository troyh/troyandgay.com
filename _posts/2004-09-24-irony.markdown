The irony of the Dan Rather/CBS News debacle that the right is enjoying is that CBS did _exactly_ the same thing that the Bush Administration did in the lead-up to the Iraq war: they ignored evidence that disproved their belief and put too much stock in the evidence that supported their belief. The only difference is that CBS News did the right thing and admitted their errors.
