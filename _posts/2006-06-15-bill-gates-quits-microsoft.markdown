Wow, end of an era. [Bill Gates is stepping down from full-time Microsoft role](http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-6084396.html?tag=nl.e589) to transition to full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Good for him, it's gotta be tough to leave the company you founded. But I can't believe this is because Microsoft needs executive changes -- Gates wasn't the problem. Ballmer and Allchin are the problem. They booted Allchin last year, which was smart. But Ballmer's gotta be on his way out the door too. Ballmer is a sales guy who'd be just as happy back at Procter & Gamble selling detergent. He's the one that turned the company from a software company to a company that makes software. That's when Microsoft lost its edge.
