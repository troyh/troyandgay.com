Since naming [Hudson](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/04/25/hudsons-8-months-old/), "Hudson" has popped up a lot that we've noticed. Our contact at our bank has a last name of Hudson, the actress Jennifer Hudson had a family tragedy and she sang at the Steelers Super Bowl, a plane miraculously landed in the Hudson in New York, and _two_ restaurants have opened in Seattle recently: [Hudson Public House](http://washingtonbeerblog.com/2009/04/14/the-hudson-new-american-public-house-open-for-business/) and [Hudson Restaurant](http://hudsonseattle.com/). Ironically, we picked the name because our other top choice was too trendy.

**Update**: Another reference today to Hudson in NYT [photo and article](http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/air-force-one-backup-rattles-new-york-nerve/).
