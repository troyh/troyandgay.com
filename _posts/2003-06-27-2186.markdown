[San Jose Mercury News](http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/business/6174058.htm): _Slap the iSight onto a 15-gigabyte iPod and all of a sudden you've got a hard-drive-based camcorder that can hold hours of Quicktime video, plus play music._

That would be brilliant. A 30GB iPod could hold up to 120 hours (!) of video. And the little [iSight](http://apple.com/isight/) and an iPod in your pocket would be much more convenient than a bulky video camera.
