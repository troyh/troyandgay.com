Today was one of the more relaxing days we've had in a while. No big performance fires, we went to lunch at The Stray Dog (where we ran into Gary and talked with him over lunch), went grocery shopping and then I worked outside on the iBook for several hours (with the dogs and my iPod).

We even fixed a few performance problems in the Talk code (removed 3 unnecessary SQL queries).
