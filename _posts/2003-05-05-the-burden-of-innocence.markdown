Watched a very moving [Frontline](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/burden/) on [PBS](http://www.pbs.org) (which is by far the most interactive media company) which dealt with the burdens faced by those that have been released from prison as a result of DNA testing.   I can't even fathom 10 or 20 or more years in prison when you are innocent of the crime.  Only 17 states have some type of retribution laws (not Washington) and the federal max is $5,000.  I'm giving to [The Innocence Project](http://www.innocenceproject.org/) this year.
