We ordered it over 2 months ago and picked up our Mini Countryman today. It was a struggle, but we fit 3 car seats in it and took the kids out for a drive around town and then to dinner in Columbia City. This is the first non-black car I've owned of the five since 1995. I've wanted a Mini since they came out in 2002, I just needed them to make a 4-door model.
