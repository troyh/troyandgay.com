Back from her vacation, [our architect](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/06/29/our-architect/) came over today to look at the property and talk about our options for locating the house. It doesn't seem practical to move the house very far north and retain the view due to the slope of the property. But we still may be able to situate it so that we have one yard instead of a front and a back yard. Gay and I don't quite agree on the importance of this, though. The architect will have to be creative to mediate between us on this and still give us south-facing windows for good [solar glazing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_solar_building_design).
