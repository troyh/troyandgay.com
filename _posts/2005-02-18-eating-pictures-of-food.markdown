[Inkjet ink you can taste](http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6983) is another example of a techie with a stupid food idea and the dummies with money who follow them: "He challenges every preconceived idea we have about food," says David Mazovick of the design consultancy Deep Labs in Chicago, which is helping the chef commercialise his ideas.

_Every_ idea we have about food? You mean except for those insignificant things like nutrients, right? This reminds me of [the dot-com era startup that made smell-o-vision](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.11/digiscent_pr.html).
