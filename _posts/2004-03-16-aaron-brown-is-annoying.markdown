Anyone watch [Aaron Brown](http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/aaron.brown/index.html)? He's the most wishy-washy news anchor I've ever seen. Instead of making statements, he hedges his bets by saying things like "It's good news, or it's not", "It's expensive, but maybe it's inexpensive", "It's a nice day, or not", "Sugar is sweet, or it could be sour", "Earth is round, or maybe it's flat", etc. Hey Aaron: You're annoying, or maybe you're irritating.
