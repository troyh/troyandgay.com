Since we were going into Seattle for [the Belle & Sebastian show](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/10/20/belle-sebastian-at-benaroya-hall/), we went to the house to check on progress again. The electrical panel has been moved from the family room area down to the mechanical room below in the basement, the old panel and wall it was on have been removed and both panels are installed in the basement. We saw the west wall of the basement that they grinded to potentially leave it exposed. They put panels showing where the skylights will go in the attic, which helps them figure out where new rafters can go that they structural engineer is demanding but no one understands. The new steel beam for the garage has been delivered and is waiting to be installed. They tested a patch of [fog coat](http://www.fogcoat.com/) on the exterior to see how well it covers. We also saw another concrete sample for the basement floor, which we're still not happy with, and there's more of those coming in the next few days.
