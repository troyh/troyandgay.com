[![](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/ABPub/a28ferrypic19_1218194303.jpeg)No Joy in Vashon](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/134598956_ferry19m.html)...Mr. Ferry's proposal is to eliminate the passenger only ferry and go to only a 2 boat schedule on weekends starting in June.  And sometime between 2005 and 2013 *consider* losing the Fauntleroy dock for downtown...right about the time we'll be getting the monorail...what's the point?
