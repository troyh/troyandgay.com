The local elementary school has a Christmas Tree sale, so we ordered our tree, a Noble Fir, of course. We put it up and decorated it today. Both Havana and Hudson were very excited to put ornaments on it; that's the first year they've done that. This is the earliest we've ever had our tree up too.

Looking forward to egg nog!
