The painting, known more for its kitchy greeting card and blow-up doll representations in the US, ["The Scream" is simply taken off the wall of the museum midday in Norway.](http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/international/AP-Norway-Museum-Theft.html?hp)  I can't believe Norway would have such horrible security after this painting has already been stolen once.
