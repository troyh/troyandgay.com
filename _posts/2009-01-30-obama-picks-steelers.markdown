He's proving once again he's the smartest President we've had in years, [picking the Steelers to win](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/29/AR2009012903196.html?hpid=topnews).

He even mentioned that Franco Harris, my idol as a kid, was an Obama supporter during the election. But really, how could he pick Arizona, McCain's home state even if he thought they had a chance?
