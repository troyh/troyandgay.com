Eva is 9 months old now. She has 4 teeth, can give kisses if you put your face close to hers, gives high-fives, will clap her hands and just started waving good-bye. She may be left-handed, at least she favors her left hand when eating. She scooches around on the floor and can do it quickly, and is starting to realize that she should get up on her knees to go even faster.
