Googling for "[Octane Fitness Err 3](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=octane+fitness+err+3&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)" doesn't provide much help, so I'm writing this to get it into Google to provide more info...

We bought an [Octane Fitness](http://www2.octanefitness.com/) elliptical machine almost 4 years ago. It's a great machine and we love it. A year ago it started showing "Err 3" on the display after being used when the Cool Down program finished. We could still use it, we just had to hit the Clear button and it was fine. I couldn't find much of anything about this online so we called the dealer where we bought it. They concluded that it needed a new right stride motor -- the motor that adjusts the length of the running stride. Octane shipped them a new one for free and we paid the $125 or so for their repair man to come over and install it. That fixed it for a while. It started doing it again a few months later so Octane thought it was one of the logic boards that was failing. They shipped them a new one of those and we paid the $125 or so for the guy to install that.

It worked fine for several months until about 4 weeks ago, when it got much worse. It used to go to "Err 3" only after Â a run, but this time it would do it after running just 1/4 mile or so. I could reset it and keep running but it would continue every few minutes or even less. This made using the machine impossible. I called Octane Fitness myself this time and talked to a very helpful tech support guy. It almost always showed Err 3 but this time it was also showing Err 2 some times. Because of this, he thought it was the logic board again so he sent me one for free and said I could install it myself and save the $125. I got it a week later and he was right, it was easy to install. But it didn't fix it. There was no improvement at all.

I called Octane Fitness again, talked to the same guy and he went through some tests on the machine with me over the phone and concluded that the right stride motor was again the problem. He sent me a new stride motor for free and, again, shipped it directly to me and said I could install it myself. At this point, I hadn't used it for over a week and wanted to get the part quicker. I explained that I appreciated him sending me the part for free, but I offered to pay for overnight or 2nd Day shipping to get it sooner. He refused to take my money and shipped it 2nd Day. I got the part, installed it, which was not as easy as the logic board, but it did fix the problem.

I learned that Err 3 means the right stride motor is failing and Err 2 means the left stride motor is failing. Err 3 is much more common because it always checks the right motor first and only checks the left if the right passed the test. The logic board runs tests on it frequently and any error at all causes it to show the error code. It'd be nice if there was a way to bypass the error-check and continue to use the machine, just without the ability to adjust the stride. I still don't know what the problem was because I was seeing both Err 3 and Err 2. Either the left stride motor is about to fail too or the logic board _and_ the right stride motor were faulty and both needed to be replaced.

It's annoying that the stride motors on the machine are so apt to break, but I am very happy with Octane Fitness' tech support and customer service for sending me parts for free every time and not even charging me for shipping! And the tech support guy (Eric?) was very polite, friendly and patient. Several weeks ago I was very upset with the machine and was expecting to have to buy a whole new machine and from a competitor (who probably has other problems with their machines). But today, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another Octane Fitness machine. In fact, the new models look so nice I'm considering getting a new one anyway.
