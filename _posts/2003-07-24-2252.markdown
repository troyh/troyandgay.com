[![letour2003.gif](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/letour2003.gif)](http://letour.fr/) Tyler Hamilton, the other American, won today's stage after surviving a _long_ breakaway. He moved up a little in the overall standings, but probably not close enough to get on the podium at the end. But it was his first Tour stage win.
