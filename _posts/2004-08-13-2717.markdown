"The Pixies":http://www.4ad.com/artists/catalogue/pixies/ are still innovative. "Ignoring the music biz":http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=P5353_0_6_0_C. And _Bam Thwok_ is as good as anything they've ever done. FWIW, I also loved "Frank Black's":http://www.frankblack.net/ first two albums, _Frank Black_ and _The Teenager of the Year_. Loved 'em, just loved 'em.
