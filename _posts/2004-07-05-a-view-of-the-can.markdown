I haven't lived in Spokane (outside of a few three-day visits -- my max) in more than 14 years.  According to [this brutal view of my birth town](http://www.smallworks.com/archives/00000070.htm), little has changed.  Mostly I like the writing and someone else bashing the place I was so anxious to leave in high school, though I agree, the unflinching tone is a bit harsh even for sarcastic-me.
