We had an appointment today on Bainbridge Island so we drove up and had lunch at the marina. It's been years since I've been to Bainbridge and it's still a cute as ever. I wish Vashon had a downtown area as nice as Bainbridge's but with half the population of Bainbridge, I don't think Vashon can sustain it.

Our appointment ran longer than expected so we just missed the ferry from Bainbridge to Seattle so we raced back down the peninsula and were the last car on the Southworth ferry back to Vashon. Phew!
