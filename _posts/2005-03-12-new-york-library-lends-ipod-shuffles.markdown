[Library Shuffles Its Collection](http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,66756,00.html):



<blockquote>For the past three weeks, the library ran a pilot program using the portable MP3 devices to store audio books downloaded from the Apple iTunes Music Store. They started with six shuffles, and now are up to a total of 10. Each device holds a single audio book.</blockquote>



What a brilliant idea!
