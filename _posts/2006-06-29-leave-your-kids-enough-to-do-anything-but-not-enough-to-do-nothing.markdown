On Monday, in yet another [Onion headline come to life, Warren Buffett gave his fortune to Bill Gates](http://www.slate.com/id/2144668/?nav=ais).  What Warren Buffett (and the Gates) are doing is admirable.  Their commitment should set a standard to which other very wealthy families are compared. When the second richest man on earth comes out strenuously against repealing the estate tax (because it creates a cycle of dependency, and is the opposite of the meritocratic society) and gets behind those words with action, I hope the country listens.
