[Searching for "Recipezaar"](http://www.google.com/search?q=recipezaar&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) on Google has always generated about 200,000 pages in the result set. Today, it's up to _6.5 million_! What happened?? I know that Recipezaar alone has  millions of pages (with all the ways you can browse recipes) but, to my knowledge, [Googlebot](http://www.google.com/bot.html) has never completely finished crawling the site to index every page. Not sure that it means anything, but it's strange that we've jumped so high in total indexed pages.
