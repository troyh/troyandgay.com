Finally! Netflix [is planning](http://money.cnn.com/2004/04/05/news/midcaps/netflix_downloads/index.htm) to launch a movie download service next year. I've said it before twice ([1](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/03/001268.php) & [2](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/09/001724.php)) that TiVo and Netflix should partner to do this. No mention of TiVo, but Netflix has to have something installed at your home do the downloading (and my desktop computer isn't going to cut it) and TiVo fits the bill, IMO.
