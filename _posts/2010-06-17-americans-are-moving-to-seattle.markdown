Forbes has [an interactive map](http://www.forbes.com/2010/06/04/migration-moving-wealthy-interactive-counties-map.html) showing where people are moving to and from in the US. People are fleeing from Detroit and Los Angeles and people are flocking to Seattle (black represents number of people moving in and red represents moving out):

I'm not surprised, Seattle is a great place to live: temperate weather, good jobs, beautiful scenery, protected environment, great outdoor activities, progressive government. Kiplinger [recently rated Seattle #2](http://www.kiplinger.com/magazine/archives/10-best-cities-2010-for-the-next-decade.html) in their list of top cities for the next decade. It's good for Seattle -- more people = bigger market = better services -- but I don't like the idea of Seattle becoming crowded. I moved away from the east coast (partly) because of all the people!
