We drove down the Pacific Coast Highway to Legoland. It's no Disneyland and Hudson was disappointed to find out that it's not just a big pile of Legos to play with. Havana went on every ride, Hudson refused to go on any rides and Eva was too little to go on any rides. 5 hours there was plenty for me.

Then we drove to San Diego through normally heavy California traffic to see White Labs, one of the two US yeast companies. They have a tasting room where you can get the same beer fermented with different yeast strains to compare the yeast. I also got a quick tour of the facility.

Ale Smith, one of my new favorite breweries, is a few minutes away so we stopped there and I picked up some beers (barrel-aged Wee Heavy and Old Numbskull!) and a shirt. Their tap room was packed with people!

Then we drove back up to Escondido for dinner at the Stone Brewery and Bistro. It's a great place with a big garden area outside. The food was okay but more upscale than a typical brewpub menu. I was surprised at how many non-Stone beers they had -- I was expecting a lot of Stone one-offs and there was a couple cask versions of their beers, but for the most part, it was a standard Stone beer list. I had Arrogant Bastard, Oaked Arrogant Bastard and the May version of Enjoy By IIPA.
