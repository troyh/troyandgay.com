After a surprisingly exciting first week, the second week has been uneventful. Today Levi Leipheimer abandoned due to a broken wrist in what seemed like a minor crash and "two riders were shot with pellet guns":http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/tdf2009/news/story?id=4337158.  In a week, there have been no changes in the GC and nothing interesting happening. They're heading into the Alps this weekend so it should be a good final week.
