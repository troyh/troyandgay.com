Online Journalism Review has a piece on MSNBC and its position within the MSN Network.  Mildly interesting.  Especialy this point:
_According to Moore, approximately two-thirds of MSNBC users come from an MSN page. We also know from a reach perspective MSN is just critical to MSNBCs success, he adds, noting that CNN has lapped MSNBC in the last six months. The only way MSNBC is going to overcome that problem is with MSNs help._
Golly is MSNBC relavant at all if most of their traffic comes from MSN?  The article talks about MSN's plans to integrate even further and they will be putting the MSN Nav on MSNBC and MSNBC's menus on MSN.
