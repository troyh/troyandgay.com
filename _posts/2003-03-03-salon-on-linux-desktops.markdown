Salon is running an article on how [Linux desktops are just mimicking Windows](http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/03/03/desktop_linux/index3.html). Nothing terribly new in the article, just more people realizing that simply copying the Windows UI is not the secret to success against Windows. Linux desktops actually have to be better than Windows; easier-to-use and more crash-resistant. But the article is incorrect that a lower price is not going to help. Lower prices _always_ helps. And eventually Linux on the desktop just may meet the "good enough" bar and coupled with a lower price, Windows is in real trouble. I think that's the most likely scenario. I have no confidence that Microsoft will come up with something so revolutionary and innovative that they quell the [Linux uprising](/archives/2003/02/21/).
