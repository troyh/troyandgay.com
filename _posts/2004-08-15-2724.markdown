If you can believe anything the New York Post publishes, "the Fed will use the internet for transferring money":http://www.nypost.com/business/18671.htm. This is great... while short-sighted people think it's going to fail, the far-sighted people will see that this will strengthen the internet and make it more secure, not less. Necessity is the mother of invention.
