[Yahoo News](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&ncid=528&e=1&cid=528&u=/ap/20030118/ap_on_hi_te/_dividend):





_"The day Microsoft declares a cash dividend is the day people no longer think about it as a growth stock," he said._





Duh.





_It said personal computers sales continue to be weak, and lowered estimates for Xbox (news - web sites) video-game console sales, saying the video-game industry is softening._





yeah, tell that to Sony, who just sold 10 million PS2s over Christmas!





_And  said its MSN  service isn't generating as many paying subscribers as the company had forecast._





Because MSN sucks!
