Being tired from the late nights and stressful days, we went to La Playa (mexican) for dinner, which is right next to the ferry pier, and sat outside watching the ferries float by. One (of the 2) cops on the island drove up the pier, parked, got out, walked to another car, tapped on the window, asked the driver to get out, handcuffed him and put him in the back of the police car. Then another cop. They took pictures of the car and then they took pictures of the guy. Then an ambulance, two fire cars and then a big fire truck drove up. The guy was unhandcuffed, the medics took care of him. Then another ambulance drove up. Out came a stretcher, the guy got a neck brace and was put on the stretcher and put in the second ambulance. This is odd on Vashon, by the way. A bystander told us that the windshield and/or front window were smashed. Seems like the guy was in a hit-and-run accident.
