Haven't talked about this at all since it started, but for the last couple weeks, a sniper has been stalking my old stomping grounds in Maryland & VA. 9 people murdered in 12 attempts and [now the police are apparently communicating with the sniper](http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/South/10/22/sniper.shootings/index.html) via phone. Apparently, he's asking for money to stop killing. Nut job.
