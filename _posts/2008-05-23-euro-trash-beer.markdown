Belgian beer company InBev NV is "offering to buy Anheuser-Busch":http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aNVBWD26Kq3w&refer=home. I hope they do, because I would love the irony of all the 'mericans swilling Bud Light supporting a European company, based in a country that speaks a form of French (_sacrebleu!_), and they wouldn't even know it. SABMiller, another European company, already owns Miller beer and MolsonCoors is not entirely American anymore. So with Anheuser-Busch, the last of the big three, no longer an American company we can finally say that American beers don't suck.
