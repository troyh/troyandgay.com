I just found a better template library than the one we use (that came with PHPBB): [Smarty](http://smarty.php.net/). It's more powerful, caches templates and is written by one of the PHP guys. Although it's [not the fastest](http://www.phpinsider.com/benchmarks/) template engine for simple things, but seems to be fast when you can offload the work to the template.
