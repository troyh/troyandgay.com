I was skeptical that these new  Spiegelau glasses, which were supposedly designed for drinking [IPAs](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Pale_Ale) but [that's not true](http://beerpulse.com/2013/02/dogfish-head-statement-confirms-that-ipa-glass-stemmed-from-riedel-o-glass/), were better than my favorite Spiegelau tulip glass but when they dropped to a low price of $10/ea I bought them. We tasted the same beer in both glasses and the IPA glass did have a noticeably more flavorful and less bitter taste. Firestone's Union Jack has always had too much of a grapefruit bitterness for me but I liked it in the IPA glass. I still don't like the look or the lack of a stem but I'll use them anyway. In fact, I bought two more!
