Today is Havana's first birthday. We survived the first year and, more importantly, so did she.

She's had an eventful year... she's done a lot of traveling: Hawaii in September, Oregon wine country in October, Cannon Beach, Oregon and Mexico in January, a drive to central California and back in March and a trip to Florida in April. She learned to say a few words and a little sign language, she learned to crawl, climb stairs and a few weeks ago, to walk and even stand up on her own.
