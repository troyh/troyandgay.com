[My alma mater, Whitman College,](http://www.whitman.edu) gets favorable press on The Jimmy Kimmel Show Thursday night when Ben Stein talked about just having given a speech at the "prestigious liberal arts college in Walla Walla -- a real place."  Though the only things he mentioned about the "4th Happiest Campus": a sign of "Coming Events" (so to speak) advertising a seminar in "Female Masturbation Technique" and the campus's celebration of "Women's Awareness Month" marked by chalk drawings of vaginas all over the sidewalks and walls, which the students loved, but janitorial staff complained about.  Actually this is all quite indicative, especially the prestigious liberal arts college part.
