[![](http://graphics7.nytimes.com/images/2003/07/01/science/01mosq.184.jpg)Interesting research on itching](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/01/health/01ITCH.html?pagewanted=2&ei=5007&en=ed88659841c3b883&ex=1372392000&partner=USERLAND): The discovery of a specific itch pathway caused a cataclysmic shift in thinking about itch...no one has figured out why a scratch feels so good though.  I've got a few mosquito bites so I'm interested right now.  I especially love it when I read that there are such things as "international itch conferences".
