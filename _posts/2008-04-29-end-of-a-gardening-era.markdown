Our yard maintenance guy of over 3 years quit abruptly today in protest when we hired a neighbor's kid to mow our lawn for the summer. I'm usually not surprised when adults are petty and juvenile, but I expected more from this guy, a guy who prides himself on his "metaphysical awareness". What's ironic is that he refused to mow our lawn for years thinking it beneath his skill-level and only started mowing the lawn last September when we went on vacation. I guess at some point between September and yesterday he decided that mowing a lawn was a core part of his being and taking that away from him was more than he could bear. In retrospect, I shouldn't be so surprised... last year he complained that we were wasting our money and his time when he held a hose for hours on end watering our garden. So we added a sprinkler to our irrigation system so he wouldn't have to do that, but he then expressed anger at the loss of that job. Some people just can't find happiness.
