Palin says she's going to "put 'the government's checkbook' online":http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/09/18/palins-transparency-proposal-already-exists-in-dc/ so everyone can see what the government spends money on. The problem is that it's already there: "USASpending.gov":http://usaspending.gov. And which Senator did it in 2006? Barack Obama.

It'll be fun to watch how many more stupid things she says and does in the next six weeks. Forget vetting her, they should have just given her an IQ test.
