I got the new [Apple wireless keyboard](http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/70203/wo/y34BFVlcLQm627Fszln4pV0pbaB/1.3.0.5.10) last night at the [Apple Store](http://www.apple.com/retail/universityvillage/). They were out of the wireless mouse so I have to go back and get that. It's like magic to use a keyboard with no cable. Sounds trivial, but it's a pleasure to see my desk without the ugly cables running across it. I feel like I'm living in the 21st century.

The other two great things about this keyboard are that 1) it's completely open, so dirt can be easily blown out of it and 2) the esc key is twice as wide, which any vi-user will tell you is a blessing.
