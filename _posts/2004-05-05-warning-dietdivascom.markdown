One of the hazards of running a small business:  people who fail to pay you.  We are very upset with this company and do not recommend them ([full story here](http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?p=980858)), but it makes me sad that one bad apple, makes you change your policy for everyone.

**Updated 1/26/2005:**  Our collection agency is unable to collect...


<blockquote>Dear Ms. Gilmore:

Counsel advises that despite all his efforts, he has been unable to obtain any cooperation on the part of the debtor in collecting this account, as written correspondence is ignored and debtor's phone listing has been disconnected. The fax number for the debtor is now a regular phone line and always has an answering machine attached, messages are left, but none were returned. Counsel has confirmed with the Secretary of State's office that the debtor's corporation is no longer active and current and was dissolved on October 1, 2004.

In light of these circumstances, it appears the debtor is no longer in business and in light of the fact that we have been unable to discuss this matter with the principal, we recommend closing file as uncollectible.

Thank you for the opportunity to have been of assistance, and we hope you will call on UMA again in the future for further collection problems.
