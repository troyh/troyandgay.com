Today's my 33rd birthday. Gay got me a new pair of slippers (to replace the ones that Ouzo chewed up). I'm going to try to take the day off today. I went out and threw the ball with Ouzo in the front yard. It's sunny but kinda chilly out with frost on the ground; a nice fall morning.

Recipezaar users posted some nice [birthday wishes](http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=19816&53) to me today. It's nice to be appreciated (even if it is by strangers:-).

We're going to go into the city today, have lunch at the Ale House in our old neighborhood, then to Abercrombie & Fitch for some sweaters (mmmm sweaters) and maybe Borders for some CDs (need to scan Amazon for some suggestions). Then stop at Thriftway in West Seattle for groceries and a nice bottle of birthday dinner wine.
