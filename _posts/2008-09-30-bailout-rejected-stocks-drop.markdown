The Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against the bailout plan, crying "Whaaaa... Pelosi said things about de-regulation... whaa whaa", and the stock market fell 8%. Fine, it's not a perfect plan. But why don't they suggest a new plan or suggest changes? Instead, they just go home until Thursday. Selfish and stupid.
