Today I got email (not spam) asking for me to [sign a petition](http://www.maketradefair.com/spage/english/action19.asp?subcat=5&cat=1&select=1&special=yes) to help fair trade in Africa, specifically trade of cotton, that would be presented to George W. Bush during his tour through Africa. Then I see the headline [Bush Calls for Changes in Africa to End Wars and Promote Trade](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/27/international/africa/27PREX.html?pagewanted=2&ei=5007&en=401489400387b4e0&ex=1372046400&partner=USERLAND) and I think that finally I can say something positive about Bush again. But the article ends:

_Mr. Bush did not specify whether he would support trade policy changes in the United States that many African leaders say are vital to the economic development of their countries. Among them are allowing textile imports, which are effectively barred under current legislation, and cutting subsidies to American farmers on crops also grown in Africa, especially cotton. _

Oh well.
