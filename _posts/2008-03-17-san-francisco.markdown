We spent Sunday in San Francisco. We went to "21st Amendment":http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/17/21st-amendment-brewpub-review/ for lunch then drove over the Golden Gate Bridge into Marin County and over to Tiburon.

After our little tour of Marin, we went back into the city to our hotel. We relaxed in the hotel room until dinner time. We went downstairs to try the hotel restaurant but they were closed on Sunday. We were too tired to walk around and it was getting late for Havana's bedtime, so we decided to get room service instead.
