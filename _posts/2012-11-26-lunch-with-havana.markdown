We took Hudson and Eva to lunch[ last Wednesday](http://troyandgay.com/2012/11/21/out-to-lunch-at-coastal-kitchen-with-hudson-and-eva/) while Havana was still at school. So Havana wanted her turn and wanted us to take her to lunch today. While Eva was home with Gerene, we went to [Elysian](http://elysianbrewing.com).
