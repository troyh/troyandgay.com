We had [dinner](http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=34221) with some Recipezaar members last night at The Ruins: GinnyP, MeanChef and Ginny's husband, Michael, and another couple who were friends of Ginny & Michael.

I believe this is the first time we've ever met Recipezaar members in person. Ginny & Michael were nice enough to treat us all to dinner (which must have been very expensive!).
