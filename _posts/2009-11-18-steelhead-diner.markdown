After the meeting at Olson Kundig, we went to [Steelhead Diner](http://www.steelheaddiner.com/) for dinner. They participate in the [Dine Around Seattle](http://www.dinearoundseattle.org/) promotion that a lot of Seattle restaurants do in November. This year, it's 3-for-30, or 3 courses for $30. From [their menu](http://www.dinearoundseattle.org/restaurants_show.php?rdx=31), I had the clam chowder and Gay had the fried oysters for appetizers and I had the salmon and Gay had the ribeye steak for the entree. They were out of the chocolate pecan pie dessert that I wanted so I got the spiced pumpkin creme brulee and Gay got the chocolate mousse. Everything was delicious.
