In [The next front[ier] in the disruption of traditional media](http://www.americanpressinstitute.org/news.cfm?id=832), we see a journalist who realizes that journalism can largely be done by anyone. **This is even more true with recipes**:
_I currently subscribe to more than 20 RSS feeds on my NetNewsWire aggregator. Three come from traditional news-media companies. The rest are offered by hobbyists and niche publishers. These feeds are no less interesting, insightful or engaging than the mainstream media feeds. These self-syndicated writers have become part of my daily media habit. A Big Media Company hoping to get on my deck will start in 20th place and will need to beat out the new breed of syndicated writers. _
