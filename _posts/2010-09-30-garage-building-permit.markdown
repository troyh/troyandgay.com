Gay went to the architect to pick up the drawings and then to the Seattle DPD to try to get our permit for the the garage and she got it. The garage was excluded from the house building permit that [we got weeks ago](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/09/02/we-got-our-permit/) because we had to prove that the garage really did exist when the house was built, that the changes aren't a change-of-use and that we are making the right structural changes to it.

Two parts of government bureaucracy down and one to go!
