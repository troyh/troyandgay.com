Watching CNN in Indonesia... one of the most important things they talk about is the price of oil. It's barely a news story in the US, but CNN Asia & CNN Europe can't get enough of it. I've never heard the terms "Sweet and sour" or "Light" referring to oil -- they talk about the different types of oil all the time, and I'm not sure why.

The other big story here is the US elections.... just goes to show that the US is _not_ an island and what happens in the US does affect the rest of the world.
