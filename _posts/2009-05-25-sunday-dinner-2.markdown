We invited Mark, Lee and Eric over for dinner at our apartment. Gay made a roasted lamb with potatoes and asparagus, Lee made a mint sauce and Mark made drinks with Pimm's. They gave Havana a book, which was very thoughtful, and Lee read it to her at the end of the evening. Mark then read one of her other new books to her as well.
