[The Head and the Heart](http://www.theheadandtheheart.com)'s "Gone"Â is my favorite ending to an album that I've heard in a long time:


<blockquote>It's your head or your heart
and you're too damn scared to start
It's in your mind and your soul
but you just don't know where to go.
It's in your head and your heart
and you're too damn scared to start
It's in your mind and your soul
but you just don't know where to go.
Now you're gone.</blockquote>
