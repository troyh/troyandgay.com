For this week's date night we went to [Sitka & Spruce](http://sitkaandspruce.com/), another place we've been trying to get to. They also do a bunch of small tasting plates. We got a 5 or 6 dishes and 2 were very good, the others were so-so. Before dinner, we had a cocktail at [Bar Ferdinand](http://www.ferdinandthebar.com/home/), which is in the Melrose Market building just a few feet from Sitka & Spruce. After dinner, we had dessert at [Lark](http://larkseattle.com/), a place we haven't been to in 7 years or so. I had a delicious fig tart and Gay got a cheese plate.
