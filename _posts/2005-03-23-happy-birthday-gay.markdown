Today is Gay's 35th birthday. We had a glass of white wine with lunch today, and [Reid](http://littlepigrobinson.blogspot.com/) and Marissa joined us for lunch (they had us over for dinner last night at Reid's father's place on the island). And we didn't even eat in the office or at our desks. Maybe I can convince Gay to have a good bottle of wine with dinner tonight. :)

[Dorel](http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=86520), the vigilant birthday wisher, started [a Happy Birthday thread](http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=113424&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0), which is always nice to see on your birthday, especially from people who don't even know you in "real life".
