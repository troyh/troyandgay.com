Today's Labor Day in the US. Will try not to work much on Recipezaar today. But I did spend the last 2 days working on fixing the cache maintenance code (trigger/handler). It's now running on newyork so that we can verify that it works before going live with it.

**Update:** we went into Seattle to drop my bike wheel off at Gregg's on Aurora, bought a couple jackets at Eddie Bauer (the salesgirl didn't remove the anti-theft tag, tho), got the brushcutter (finally!) and 500 ft. of outdoor Cat5 cable (for the Kelly Electric guys to run into the crawl space) at Home Depot, bought CDs (Wilco, Coldplay, Future Bible Heroes and Stephin Merritt), got some dogfood at PetCo and got take-out Indian food.
