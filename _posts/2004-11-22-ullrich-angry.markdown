[Jan Ullrich is upset](http://www.velonews.com/race/int/articles/7235.0.html) about Lance's comments about him being lazy: "Lance does not know me at all. This comment is probably due to his American mentality."

Ullrich wasn't much of a threat in the 2004 Tour but, assuming Lance does race it in 2005, this could be the start of a good rivalry. They've had a good rapport before, however.
