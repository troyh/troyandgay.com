A great idea to keep subscription renewals high is from [ American Greetings subscriptions Family Plan](http://www.econtentmag.com/r16/2002/smith8_02.html): _But AG's real ace in the hole, its killer retention app, could be the Family Plan. New subscribers actually get three accounts,two of which can be handed over to friends and relatives. In this truly inspired example of true Web marketing, AG has woven its business model into the P2P appeal of ecards by tying one person's subscription to another's. When the primary subscriber cancels or fails to renew, all the attached accounts go dead as well. The company is hoping that for the low price of $11.95, a paying subscriber will think twice or thrice at renewal time before cutting off Aunt Lucy's "free" ecard account._
