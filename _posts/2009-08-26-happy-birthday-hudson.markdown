Hudson is one year old today! It's hard to believe a year has gone by already since [he was born](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/25/hudsons-birth/).

He's on the verge of walking by himself, I can feel it. And he's developed a brutal scream that he uses just whenever, not when he's upset or hurt, just to make noise. Havana is not one to mind loud screams but even she tells him "That's too loud, Hudson" and "Inside voices" when he does it. He's been a great baby, is very happy and giggly and laid-back and able to put up with Havana. The next year should be even more fun as he becomes more active and independent and is able to play with Havana more.

Incidentally, Hudson not only shares his birthday with [a bunch of cool people](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/26/august-25th/), but he was also born on the 399th Anniversary of the day [Galileo demonstrated his telescope](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/08/photogalleries/galileos-telescope-pictures-anniversary/).
