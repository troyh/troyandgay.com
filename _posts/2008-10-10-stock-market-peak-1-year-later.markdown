Exactly one year after the stock market peak on Oct 12, 2007, [it's down more than 42%](http://finance.google.com/finance?chdnp=0&chdd=1&chds=1&chdv=1&chvs=maximized&chdeh=1&chdet=1223669600635&chddm=98532&q=INDEXSP:.INX&ntsp=0):

I predict it'll drop at least another 10% before it comes back. But if you want to double your money in a year or two, invest now.

Interestingly, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is only down 9.88% [in the same period](http://finance.google.com/finance?chdnp=0&chdd=1&chds=1&chdv=1&chvs=maximized&chdeh=1&chdet=1223670666980&chddm=98923&q=NYSE:BRK.A&ntsp=0):
