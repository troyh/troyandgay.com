"The US is going even farther right-wing":http://salon.com/opinion/blumenthal/2004/11/03/second_bush_term/index.html: _While Kerry ran on the mainstream American traditions of international cooperation and domestic investment, and transparency and rationality as essential to democratic government, Bush campaigned directly against these very ideas. At his rallies, Bush was introduced as standing for "the right God." During the closing weeks of the campaign, Bush and Cheney ridiculed internationalism, falsifying Kerry's statement about a "global test." They disdained Kerry's internationalism as effeminate, unpatriotic, a character flaw and elitist. "You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig," Vice President Cheney derided in every speech. They grafted imperial unilateralism onto provincial isolationism. Fear of the rest of the world was to be mastered with contempt for it._

Waking up today I feel like the US just turned a corner and is headed down a dark alley. I feel much like I remember feeling on 9/11: the fear and uncertainty of a new world. I do not want to have kids and raise them in a country that rejects logic and rational thought in favor of irrational ideology. I don't want to raise kids fighting against the US mentality of hatred for the rest of the world. I want my kids to appreciate and respect the world and its different cultures -- that's simply un-American these days and I'm convinced that it's not going to get better in my lifetime. What we do with our lives will be a question I'll be trying to answer for the next several months, but I will spend the day today investigating real estate in Europe.

If anyone has any suggestions or advice for living in Europe, please pass it along... the more info the better! :)
