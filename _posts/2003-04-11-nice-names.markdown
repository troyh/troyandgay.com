I think some of the names in the middle east sound so nice: "Kabul", "Qatar" (I pronounce 'Ku-TAR', not 'cutter'), "Al-Nasiriyah", "Afghanistan", "Kandahar", "Basra", "Kirkuk", "Tikrit" and "Baghdad". Even "Iraq" is a cool name (but not "Iran", that's a Flock of Seagulls [song](http://www.aflockofseagulls.co.uk/IRan.txt)). Iraq even has a great Internet top-level domain name: iq.
