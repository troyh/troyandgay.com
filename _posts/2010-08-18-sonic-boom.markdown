This afternoon I heard and felt two loud explosions that shook the house. It felt like a bomb went off at the neighbor's house. I thought it was a big earthquake because you always hear a loud sound when an earthquake starts. It turns out that Obama was in Seattle today ([he lived on Capitol Hill as an infant](http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2009/01/07/when-and-where-obama-lived-on-this-capitol-hill), by the way), a small sea plane inadvertently entered the restricted airspace around the President, [two F-15 fighters scrambled to intercept](http://www.kirotv.com/news/24664589/detail.html) causing a sonic boom. I've never heard one before. The Pacific Northwest Seismic Network [captured it](http://www.king5.com/news/local/Puget-Sound-area-rocked-by-sonic-booms-100922594.html?gallery=y&c=y&img=1#gallery-image) on their instruments.
