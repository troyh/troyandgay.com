Gay and I went to Seattle's newest Greek restaurant, [Omega Ouzeri](http://www.omegaouzeri.com/). It's from the guy who did [Vios](http://www.vioscafe.com/vioscapitolhill.html), a more casual Greek restaurant a couple blocks from our house. I love Greek food and Seattle has too few Greek restaurants and even fewer good ones. The food at Omega was excellent — I had a deconstructed gyro—  and reminded me that I don't drink enough ouzo.
