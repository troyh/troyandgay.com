Steve and Renuka and their kids, Owen and Claire, came over for a post-Thanksgiving dinner. They brought a bottle of [Leonetti](http://www.leonetticellar.com/) (we've never had a Leonetti) that we drank with a delicious dinner. After dinner, the kids watched a couple movies on the big screen: Tinkerbell and Shark Tale. Havana was in heaven with her friends and Hudson even sat still and watched one of the movies. I've kept a large selection of beers in the fridge that I haven't gotten around to drinking and when me, Steve and lots of beer choices are in the same room the next day is never good for me. I had the worst hangover I've had probably all year on Sunday. But it was a fun time.
