Just days after [buying AltaVista](http://money.cnn.com/2003/02/18/technology/overture/index.htm), Overture is [buying](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/29469.html) [FAST](http://www.fastsearch.com/), which gives them AllTheWeb.

So here we are... [Yahoo!](http://yahoo.com) owns [Inktomi](http://inktomi.com), [AskJeeves](http://askjeeves.com) owns [Teoma](http://teoma.com) and [Overture](http://overture.com) owns [AltaVista](http://altavista.com) and [FAST](http://fastsearch.com). This is good because Google needs competitors; Google is increasingly bad at finding what I need and Google is becoming far too powerful. Or is everyone just doing a land grab before [Google's inevitable IPO](http://abcnews.go.com/sections/business/DailyNews/google020618.html) when they could generate enough cash to buy all the other search engines?

Along these lines, I wish Apple would add other search engines to the Google bar in [Safari](http://apple.com/safari).
