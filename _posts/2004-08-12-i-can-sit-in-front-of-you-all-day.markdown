![apple display](http://troyandgay.com/pix/appledisplay.jpg)I got a new Apple Cinema Display right in the middle of heavy wedding action, so I haven't had a chance to truly enjoy it until this week.  I have regained an enormous amount of real estate on my desk, leaving my old two monitor configuration behind, but more importantly this is the crispest, brightest, most beautiful computer thing I've ever owned.  I love doing work.  I love being able to work in my editor, check my work in an open browser, while still having room on screen to get to email or my calendar with a click AND carry on 2 instant messenger conversations at the same time...all without having to turn my head in the slightest or run my mouse from screen to screen.
