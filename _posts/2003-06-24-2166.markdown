Boy, I can relate to [this](http://www.theonion.com/onion3924/area_man_constantly.html). I can't even begin to count the number of people who've made it clear to me that they don't own a TV in the last year or so. And a sure-fire way to get people to make this claim is to tell them how great TiVo is. I'm the last person to like TV, but geez, 90% of TV being lousy is not a reason to not own a TV. 90% of books are lousy too, but you'll never hear these enlightened intellectuals say "I don't own any printed dead trees".
