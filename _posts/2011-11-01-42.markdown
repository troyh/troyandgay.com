Today I'm at the meaningful age of [42](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)). I'm officially not young any more. Looking back, I was a kid being pulled by a fire inside trying my best with my limited abilities and somehow ended up having a fun, lucky and very fortunate life...





<blockquote>

> I want to dance with this fire
Because it's all that I know
As the spotlight turns towards me
I just try my best to show

> 
> We are lost
We are freaks
We are crippled
We are weak
We are the heirs
To all the world
>

Looking forward, I want to build a new fire and show my kids and help them build theirs.

This old song from my youth always seemed so relevant to me. It inspired me then and still seems to.
