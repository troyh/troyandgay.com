Eric & Steve threw a fabulous welcome home party for our friend Mark Weeks on Saturday who has been living in Amsterdam and London for...well, too long!  Good to see lots of old friends and drink Eric's [French 77s](http://www.recipezaar.com/search/getrecipe.zsp?id=8532) (this is my recipe not his, we'll have to get him to post it!).
