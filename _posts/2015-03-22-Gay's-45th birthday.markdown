Gay wanted to have her 45th birthday party at the brewery but it's not ready yet. While [at brunch this morning](https://twitter.com/troy_h/status/579691093123473408), we decided to have a few friends over to the brewery for a miniature party instead. Jon, Megan, Dierdre and Patrick joined us and the kids for some beer and pizza tonight.

The kids got to climb up to the mezzanine and run around â€” they quickly became ladder experts.

It got cold at the building so we went home for cake and shuffleboard.
