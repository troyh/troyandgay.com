Wow, O'Reilly has Netflix-for-eBooks! [Safari Online](http://safari.oreilly.com/) lets you rent electronic books from publishers such as O'Reilly, Addison-Wesley, New Riders, Prentice Hall, Que, etc. For $10/mo to $30/mo you can have 5-30 books in your "bookshelf" and have full-access to them as long as you want (and pay the subscription fee). They currently have 1,251 books in the collection. Given that these are all technical books, reading them at your computer is not a bad thing. Just brilliant!

I seem to have lost my copy of Knuth's [Searching & Sorting](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/books/0201485419/102-9164715-1174537), but unfortunately, it's not in the set (yet?).  Otherwise, I'd sign up right now!
