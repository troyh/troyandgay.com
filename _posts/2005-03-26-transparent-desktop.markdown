Inspired by [these](http://www.flickr.com/photos/w00kie/sets/180637/), I made my own transparent desktop. It's a fun thing to do on a rainy Seattle saturday.

**Update:** So Slashdot gets around to [talking about this](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/03/27/029216&from=rss) (remember when Slashdot was first? Now they seem to be last). And the overriding criticism is that people "have too much time on their hands". From the time I first saw this til the time I had mine up was 15 minutes. And I did it twice (the first one sucked). And I had to run downstairs to find the camera and scrounge around for our tripod (which isn't needed). And I had to charge the battery.
