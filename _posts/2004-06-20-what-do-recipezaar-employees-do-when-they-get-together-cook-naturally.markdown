![](http://www.recipezaar.com/img/recipes/60/58/1/thumbs/pic0cwCwk.jpg)[Kathy](http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=6651) visited Recipezaar headquarters for training this week, and we had a wonderful (and productive) time.  We really couldn't be happier with the "rest of our team".  For her last night we all cooked a mess of Recipezaar recipes, and had a blast taking photos of them.  The menu included:
[Green Onion Pancakes](http://www.recipezaar.com/getrecipe.zsp?id=14530)
[Sichuan Pepper-Salt Prawns](http://www.recipezaar.com/getrecipe.zsp?id=37634)
[Ginger Sesame Asparagus](http://www.recipezaar.com/getrecipe.zsp?id=79216)
[Aromatic Sticky Rice](http://www.recipezaar.com/getrecipe.zsp?id=90126)
[Best Cherry Pie](http://www.recipezaar.com/getrecipe.zsp?id=60581)

It is so nice to like the folks you work with.  Just wish Kathy was closer, I'd love to do this every week!
