So [who did Tenet name](http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/text/2003/jul/17/071708371.html) as the White Houser responsible for the misleading uranium claim in the State of the Union Address? My money is on either Rumsfeld or Wolfowitz. Both of those guys strike me as guys who truly believe the ends justify the means.
