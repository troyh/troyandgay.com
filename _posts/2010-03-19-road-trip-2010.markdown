On our way to Bend, Oregon...

After washing and cleaning the Jeep, I tried to start it to put in the garage and it wouldn't start. It sounds like the starter is bad. [Googling](http://www.jeepcommander.com/forums/showthread.php?t=5647) seems to show that this is a common problem with Commanders. So we took the Lexus instead and will hope that there's no snow in Tahoe.
