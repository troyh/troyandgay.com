I was listening to my music library randomly today and heard a song from a band called "The Amps" that I've never listened to and it sounded so familiar I thought it was a cover version.

In 1989, [New Model Army](http://www.newmodelarmy.org/) released "Inheritance" and it starts like this:

10 years later, in 1999, [The Amps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amps) (formed by Kim Deal of the Pixies and The Breeders) released "[Hoverin](http://new.music.yahoo.com/amps/tracks/hoverin--1081914)" and it starts like this:

That's a blatant rip-off, in my opinion.
