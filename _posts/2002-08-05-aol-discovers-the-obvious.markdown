NY Times has an [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/05/technology/05MOOD.html?pagewanted=print&position=bottom) on how AOL is realizing that community is their bread & butter, not "synergy" between marketing and online content. Duh. They also have realized that users hate pop-up ads. Double Duh.
