The [Tour](http://www.letour.fr/) started more exciting than most, with a team time-trial so early, but it's been boring since the first few days. This weekend should see some interesting stages. But [Samuel Abt](http://www.iht.com/articles/529597.html) thinks the excitement will come next week. But I just don't see how Lance can lose this year, unless he screws up. Ullrich just doesn't look that strong and is already farther behind than he should be at this point. Iban Mayo is out, of course. Whodathunkit that the 6th victory would be so easy?
