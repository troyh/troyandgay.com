I remember when we thought the browser would basically replace the OS.  (I use a great browser on the Mac so this doesn't really apply to me, but) [Google seems to be giving the browser a competitor](http://toolbar.google.com/index-beta.php) -- specifically a new pop-up blocker and "blog this!" buttons.
