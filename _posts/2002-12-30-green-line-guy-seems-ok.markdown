_On a typical weekday, Horn [[executive director of the Monorail](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/134605199_monohorn30m.html)] works over the cellphone or his BlackBerry handheld computer while he rides the No. 5 bus downtown. A staff meeting begins at 7:30 a.m., and latecomers are fined $1 per minute. The lesson he takes from Sound Transit is that quickness means everything._

Bet the head of Sound Transit doesn't take the bus with his $170,000 salary...
