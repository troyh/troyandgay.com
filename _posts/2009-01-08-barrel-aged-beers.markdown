The New York Times did "a taste test of barrel-aged beers":http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/dining/07wine.html?_r=1, which is a recent trend in brewing. See their "tasting report":http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/dining/07wlis.html?ref=dining. I'm still trying to get my hands on Pike's Entire bourbon barrel-aged stout, but I "have had Dogfish Head's Burton Baton barrel-aged IPA":http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/06/11/dogfish-head-burton-baton-imperial-ipa/, which is very good and I still have a few bottles left waiting for a good reason.
