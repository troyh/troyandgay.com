"There's outrage in Bridge tournament":http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/arts/14brid.html?_r=1&bl&ex=1195362000&en=be84a7a2e1b150cc&ei=5087%0A&oref=slogin because an American contestant publicly announced that she didn't vote for Bush and some people are calling it treason. Outing a CIA spy and destroying years of intelligence work? Not treason. Telling people how you voted? Definitely treason. Hoo boy, Bridge players around the country are going to be crushing their decks of cards with their trucks.
