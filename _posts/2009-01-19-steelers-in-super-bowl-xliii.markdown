The Steelers beat the Ravens for the 3rd time this year to go to the Super Bowl against the Cardinals (and two of their former coaches). If they win, they will be the first team to win 6 Super Bowls. I don't want to be over-confident, but I'm more confident that the Steelers will beat the Cardinals than I was that they'd beat the Seahawks in 2005.
