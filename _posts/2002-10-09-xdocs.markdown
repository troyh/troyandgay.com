More dumbass analyst-speak after Ballmer [announces XDocs](http://rss.com.com/2100-1001-961313.html?type=pt&part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news): _Meta Group analyst David Yockelson said XDocs is "powerful because it lets me collect up a lot of related information into a tabular format," Yockelson said. "It removes the demarcation between what a spreadsheet is, what a document is, what a form is, and how I can look at and retrieve information that would be in those things."_

Gee, collecting related info in a tabular format? Never been possible before fat-ass Ballmer touts XML. I wonder if David Yockelson said that the Xbox is "powerful because it lets me play video games on my television".
