The one with the woman who is so concerned about her child's safety on the internet hands her baby to a stranger so she can make her case to the AOL execs. And the one where the crowd of AOL customers storm AOL headquarters to give feedback instead of using email. Slate humorously points out the other flaws in the commercials.
