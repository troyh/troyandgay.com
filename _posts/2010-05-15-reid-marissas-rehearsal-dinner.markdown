Tonight was the Rehearsal Dinner for Reid & Marissa's wedding at [The Harbor Club](http://www.harborclubs.org/seattle_clubinfo.cfm) in downtown Seattle, which has a great view of Elliot Bay all the way to Mt. Rainier. The usual people were there and we met a few other friends and people from Marissa's family.

A surprise was to see Eric Wagner there, who was supposed to be on their boat in Panama. We last [saw them in December](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/12/09/eric-valerie-in-cabo/) in Mexico.
