We took our bouncy house to Havana's school today and Gay made cupcakes so she could celebrate her birthday with her school friends. She likes butterflies, or "papillons", so she requested "butterfly cupcakes". Gay had to get creative:

Everyone sang "Happy Birthday" to her in French and then they ate their cupcakes. Then we all went outside to play in the bouncy house for an hour. That tired them all out and there were only a couple injuries and crying kids, which is pretty good.
