Went to the all-new [Sound Food](http://www.nwculture.com/NWC/Islands/VashonIsland/CoffeehousesCafes/SoundFood/sf.html) restaurant on the island last night for dinner. I think it was the 2nd best food I've had on the island; an island that is severely lacking in good restaurants. We then came home and played a close game of Trivial Pursuit and I won with an unbelievable gimmie question: "Who, after recovering from testicular cancer, wrote a book called _It's not about the bike_". HA ha.

Speaking of [Lance Armstrong](http://lancearmstrong.com/), he [finished 32nd](http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=ap-tourofmurcia&prov=ap&type=lgns) in the 5-stage Tour of Murcia today.
