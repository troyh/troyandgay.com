![](http://troyandgay.com/pix/usatoday.gif)Gay adds to her increasing list of published quotes with a quote in [USATODAY about Google's AdSense](http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2005-03-10-google-ads-usat_x.htm):



<blockquote>Gay Gilmore, who runs Seattle-based recipezaar.com, says the trick is to attract ads next to recipes beyond the main page. "The ads need to be targeted," she says, "so that when someone is reading about chicken soup, an ad for one of the ingredients is of keen interest."</blockquote>
