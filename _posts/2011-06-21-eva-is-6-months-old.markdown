Eva is now 6 months old. She's eating solid foods almost completely now, sleeps really well usually, has a great temperament, can pick up her binky and put it in her mouth on her own.Â We celebrated her half-birthday with a cake after dinner.

Mark and Lee, who are in Seattle visiting from London, came over for dinner and celebrated with us. They brought Eva a cute onesie, Hudson a polo shirt and Havana a counting game involving London buses. Hudson wanted to put his shirt on right away and Mark and Lee played the game with her and Hudson while we had cocktails.
