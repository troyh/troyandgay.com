"Julia Child dies at 91":http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/13/dining/13CND-CHILD.html, apparently of kidney failure. The introduction to her 7th book: "Dining with one's friends and beloved family is certainly one of life's primal and most innocent delights, one that is both soul-satisfying and eternal."

They've organized a "Cook-A-Thon as a tribute":http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?p=1176046 to Julia.
