It's been 3 years, almost to the day, since [Illy died](http://troyandgay.com/2010/12/22/illy-1995-2010/) so a new dog is long overdue. 
 
Our English Bulldog puppy arrived today at the airport via [United Airlines PetSafe](https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/travel/animals/petsafe.aspx) delivery. Gay and I went to pick him up and took him straight to the vet for an initial checkup. 

He's exactly 9 weeks old today, weighs 8lbs 11oz, is in good health and is, as  yet, unnamed. We have a list of names (that mostly) the kids came up with that are acceptable to us but no final decision yet. I refuse to yell in public to a dog named "Sofa", "Sandwich", "Bowling Pin", etc.

I'm not a fan of the English tradition of in-breeding  (*cough* British Royal Family *cough*), but I do want a Bulldog and we waited too long for a Bulldog mutt, so I acquiesced. I hope we can potty-train him faster than we did the kids.
