_Your (or whoever's) website is full of misspelled words and bad grammar.  For starters "zaar" is spelled either "czar" or "tzar" but never "zaar".
Just a friendly suggestion that you have someone proofread what goes on your website, preferably someone whose spelling and grammar knowledge you can trust.  It is much more professional that way.  _

For starters, did you really think we misspelled our LOGO?  Do your friends ever call you "Mo", Maureen?

I've been laughing at this one all day....
