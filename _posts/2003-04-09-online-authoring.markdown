The web gave us online publishing, now Dan Gillmor is writing a new book about [online authoring](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/000924.shtml#000924), which invites participation from you. This will be interesting to watch as I strongly believe that the web is the most powerful publishing mechanism created and will transform today's publishing model in significant ways. Don't invest in paper-manufacturing companies.
