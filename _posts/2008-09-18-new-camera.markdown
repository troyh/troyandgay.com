I finally got an "SLR":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera camera, a "Canon EOS 450D":http://www.dpreview.com/news/0801/08012403canoneos450d.asp (or it's "maverick-style" name Canon Digital Rebel XSi), in the hopes of taking better photos.

I posted the best ones in "their own Photoset":http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/sets/72157607352909589/ on Flickr.

It's not as convenient to carry as a tiny point-and-shoot, but the quality is much higher and I can get different lenses to take more interesting shots. Now I need to get an HD camcorder to take better-quality videos of the kids before they grow up.
