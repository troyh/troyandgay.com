![IMG_2328.jpg](http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2328.jpg)We put one coat of the red on the window wall. We're not sure we like it though, it's a little too pink for our tastes. But we do like the red wall as it has a nice contrast with the view outside the windows which highlights the windows. We're still trying to decide on a color for the other walls.

We also discovered another problem with the construction work: the trim was mounted too low. On the other wall where the trim was not removed, it's a half-inch above the floor so that flooring can be installed underneath the trim. But the reinstalled trim is mounted flush with the floor. So we think the trim has to be redone for the second time. And because of the outlets, the existing trim can't be reused.

(I need to clean the lens on the camera!)
