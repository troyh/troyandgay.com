We had a quiet Thanksgiving, just the four (that's still weird to say) of us. I watched all three blow-out football games and tried to keep Havana and Hudson from bothering Gay in the kitchen.

We sampled several beers that I've received from a beer-of-the-month club my brother gave me for Christmas last year and found a couple good ones -- Gay liked the "Saranac Caramel Porter":http://www.saranac.com/page/caramel-porter and I liked the "Shipyard Prelude Special Ale":http://www.shipyard.com/.
