The Steelers [beat the Chargers](http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09012/941276-66.stm?cmpid=steelers.xml) to go to the Championship game against the Ravens.

The Ravens was the one team I was hoping would lose during the playoffs because I think the Steelers could beat any of the other teams. They can beat the Ravens too, and did twice this year, but the Ravens will be tough.

The Steelers were the only team this weekend who was favored to win that did win, the only home team to win and the only team with a bye week last week to win. And it ended up not mattering that they were the #2 seed and not the #1 seed because, thanks the Titans losing, they get to play at home through the playoffs.
