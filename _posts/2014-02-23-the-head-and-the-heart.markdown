Gay and I went to a late (for us) 9pm dinner at [Mamnoon](http://www.mamnoonrestaurant.com/), a Lebanese place which was fantastic, and more Greek-like than I expected.  Then we walked down the street to the Paramount theater to see my current favorite band [The Head And The Heart](http://www.theheadandtheheart.com/).

We even saw our ex-employee Liza in the same row as us but didn't get a chance to talk to her.
