Gay decided to take the kids to Spokane to surprise her mom for her 75th birthday this weekend. That meant me and Barley had some quality time together. Gay discovered [Munchery](http://munchery.com) and had dinner delivered to me Friday and Saturday night. Here's Friday night's dinner, eggplant Parmesan, roasted tomato soup, a coconut cream pie for dessert, plus a snickerdoodle cookie:

All I had to do was heat everything up and eat. It was amazing. 

And here's Barley enjoying our time together:
