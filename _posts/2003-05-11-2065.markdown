On Friday, the Benders and another Vashon friend, Carol Eggen, came over for dinner (barbequed hamburgers).

On Saturday, we skipped our plans to go the [new Apple Store](http://www.apple.com/retail/bellevuesquare/), the first in Seattle. Instead, we worked most of the day, as usual. :(  But we at least took advantage of the great weather and spent a good amount of time outdoors playing with the dogs and just relaxing.

I'm going to make a serious effort to get my weekends back. :)
