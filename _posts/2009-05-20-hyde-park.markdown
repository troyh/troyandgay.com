After getting a late start due to napping, we walked to Hyde Park and went to a playground there for Havana to play. Then we walked (too far) to have a beer and a snack for the kids at The Iron Duke. We walked home through a shopping district, down Piccadilly and back to our apartment.

While Gay put the kids to bed, I ordered take-out dinner from an Italian place down the street. We watched TV from home over Slingplayer and went to bed.
