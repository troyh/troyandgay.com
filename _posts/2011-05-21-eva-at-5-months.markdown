Eva is 5 months old today. Her temperament is still very good and she's sleeping for long stretches at night more and more often. She is much more active when put in one of her play circle things, spinning around on her own and playing with the toys. She's not as ticklish as she was a month ago, it's hard to get her to giggle anymore when we tickle her tummy or neck. She's started eating solids on occasion and has been very good at it, not spitting it most of it up like the other kids did. She is more responsive when you call her name and turns to look at you.
