Kevin Spacy, [Walt Mossberg](http://ptech.wsj.com/archive/ptech-20030918.html), Joe Piscapo (is he still a celebrity?), even Howard Stern has a [Treo 600](http://www.handspring.com/products/communicators/treo600_overview.jhtml).  It is like the whole world is mocking me and T-mobile which must be the last carrier to roll out the damn thing.  I check the Handspring site daily -- more often than I visit any other web site...
