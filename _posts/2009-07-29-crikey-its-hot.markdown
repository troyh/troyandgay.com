It's been in the 90s all week. Yuck. It may even be the hottest day on record in Seattle, "it has never been over 100 here":http://bit.ly/mN1op! But the evenings are perfect for drinking beer outside until 10pm.

At about 5:45pm we lost power, probably because of everyone blasting their A/C. We've never lost power in the summer before. I love our gas generator!

It did turn out to be "a record at 103":http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2009558896_webhot29m.html. It hasn't been this hot in Seattle since July 1994 and before that, 1941.

We may turn on the air-conditioner tomorrow.
