The mastermind behind the hijacking of the [Achille Lauro](http://www.terrorismvictims.org/terrorists/achille-lauro.html) in 1985 was [caught today](http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/04/15/sprj.irq.abbas.arrested/index.html) in Iraq, attempting to escape into Syria.  It's becoming more and more clear that Iraq was a supporter of terrorism. I wonder how many more of these rocks they'll turn over in Iraq.
