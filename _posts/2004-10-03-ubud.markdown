After a stop for lunch at a great restaurant in Sanur, Legong Restaurant, we made it to our place in Ubud.

The photo shows our view from the villa, and you can see the [Four Seasons in Sayan](http://www.fourseasons.com/forward.weml?property_name=sayan&) (the _other_ Four Seasons in Bali) nestled in the trees.
