Another mention of Recipezaar in a newspaper! The [St. Petersburg Times](http://www.sptimes.com) [mentions Recipezaar](http://www.sptimes.com/2003/02/19/Taste/Dish.shtml): _Faced with nearly 50,000 recipes (an embarrassment of riches), your biggest problem will be picking one from this voluminous site. Recipes are conveniently categorized and easily sorted, and this will help. If time is of the essence, you can choose by preparation time (0 to 15 minutes, 15 to 30 minutes or 30 to 60 minutes). If economy is important, you can choose among 7,818 recipes that use five or fewer ingredients. People on special diets will find this site fertile ground, with options for diets of every ilk._
