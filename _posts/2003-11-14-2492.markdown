I rode my "long" ride three times this week. One of my New Year's Resolutions from last year was to ride half my rides on the long route, so I think I'm going to meet that resolution this year. And good thing I got a lot of riding in this week, because I just got this weather alert: A SERIES OF INCREASINGLY STRONG WEATHER SYSTEMS WILL CROSS WESTERN  WASHINGTON TONIGHT THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK.
