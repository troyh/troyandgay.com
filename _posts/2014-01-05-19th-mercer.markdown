An evening out and walk to the newly-constructed 19th & Mercer retail space just 3 blocks away: Dinner at [Tallulah's](http://aneighborhoodcafe.com/), a new [Linda Derschang](http://seattletimes.com/html/nicolebrodeur/2021127410_nicole09xml.html) restaurant then the kids had ice cream at [Hello Robin](http://www.hellorobincookies.com/), a neighbor's first store, and I got a growler fill-up, Fremont's Abominable, no less, at [Cone & Steiner](http://coneandsteiner.com/), our friend Dani Cone's upscale market. _I love this neighborhood!_
