[Kerry requests monthly debates](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/nm/20040313/pl_nm/campaign_kerry_dc) so we can gauge for ourselves who is the best person for the job. But Bush refuses with a pathetic and downright insulting excuse! I'd rather see monthly live debates than 8 months of polished commercials daily. Bush, once again, lets America down. This guy thinks we work for him. We should _demand_ that he debate so that the American people have more info to make their Nov 2 decision.
