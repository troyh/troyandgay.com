Back when I was at Microsoft, one of my projects was to add integration of NetMeeting (Microsoft's online videoconferencing product) into Outlook. In 1998, if I recall correctly, [Matthew Bookspan](http://mbookspan.spaces.live.com/) wrote a patent filing for this feature and added my name to it. All I did was review the thing, if that. And lo and behold, [the patent](http://assignments.uspto.gov/assignments/q?db=pat&qt=pat&reel=&frame=&pat=6363352&pub=&asnr=&asnri=&asne=&asnei=&asns=) was granted in 2002.

Frankly, though, it's a patent that shouldn't have been granted. I didn't think it had a chance at the time, since we didn't do anything that wasn't terribly obvious. Now I'm part of [the software patent problem](http://lpf.ai.mit.edu/Patents/patents.html).
