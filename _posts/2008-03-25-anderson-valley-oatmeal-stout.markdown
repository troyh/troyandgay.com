A very good oatmeal stout, "Anderson Valley":http://avbc.com/ Brewing Company's Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout...

It's about as dark as a stout can get with a foamy tan head. It tastes malty, part chocolate, part coffee-flavor with a slight bitterness on the aftertaste. It tastes like a classic oatmeal stout to me. It's rated a "3.63 on RateBeer":http://ratebeer.com/beer/anderson-valley-barney-flats-oatmeal-stout/334/ and an "A- on BeerAdvocate":http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/193/615.

We drove through Anderson Valley on "our way from Mendocino to Napa":http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/12/eureka-to-napa-california/ and must've driven right by it. I knew this brewery was somewhere in the area when I saw the sign for the Anderson Valley, but we didn't stop and now I'm regretting it.
