I begrudgingly went to Disneyland and planned to hate it. But I was impressed, especially with California Adventure and Cars Land, for the construction alone. I was not expecting that level of attention to detail and clever design. I highly recommend the "VIP Tour" -- a Disney person guides you through the park, tells you the history and points out interesting things but most importantly, gets you right into the rides without having to wait in line (mostly); it's basically FastPass but without requiring a reservation.
