We visited Twisted Metalworks and then [12th Avenue Iron](http://www.12thavenueiron.com/) to meet the metal fabricators for the metal work in the house. 12th Avenue Iron has a very cool shop (with an office designed by Tom Kundig) and is in our neighborhood on Capitol Hill.

One or both of them will do steel shelving in the kitchen and family room, steel cladding on the office sliding wall and pantry barn door, steel plating on the pantry shelving, steel cladding on the basement stair risers and the steel wall and handrail for the basement stairs, steel plating on our bathroom vanity cabinetry and around the doorways, door pulls on the barn doors and, possibly, a wall-mounted bottle opener in the butler's pantry.
