Wow, this is a good beer! I had my first, but hopefully not the last, "Russian Imperial Stout":http://www.stonebrew.com/irs/ from Stone Brewing Co. Dare I say it's even better than my favorite Russian Imperial Stout, "Old Rasputin":http://www.northcoastbrewing.com/beer-rasputin.htm? The best way to describe this beer is that it's like drinking a really good chocolate cake. I couldn't get enough of it, so I'm glad it comes in a 22 oz. bottle.
