Hudson started preschool today at [Nanny's](http://www.savvysource.com/preschools/washington/seattle/sh2503-nannys-annex-preschool). He went there this summer for a couple weeks in August, so he's used to it and loves it. His friends are Ryker and Josie and seems to play with the trains all day, is a little shy but seems to like singing songs.
