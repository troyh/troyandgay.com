[It's true](http://sippey.com/b/2004/06/where-does-rss-belong.html), reading news is best done in your browser, not in an email-like application. Geeks today adopting RSS love the "email model" because they live in email, and really bad 7-pane (!) email clients like Outlook, to boot. But the masses will read news in their browser. And yes, RSS replaces the act of web browsing.
