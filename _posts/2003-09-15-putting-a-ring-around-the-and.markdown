# Troy and I got engaged last night!



...in front of a very-well lit Korean deli and a gaggle of crackheads.  Five years ago it was a more romantic street and the spot of our first kiss after a [Bedhead](http://www.brainwashed.com/bedhead/info.html) concert at the [Crocodile Cafe](http://www.thecrocodile.com/).  We tried to celebrate with dinner at the [Queen City Grill](http://www.queencitygrill.citysearch.com/), the same place we'd had dinner that night five years before -- and had never been back to since; I'd been so grumpy about it the first time -- but they were too full so we went to the always amazing [Dahlia Lounge](http://www.tomdouglas.com/dahlia/index.html), toasting with a bottle of one of our favorite cabernets, [Silver Oak](http://www.silveroak.com/).
