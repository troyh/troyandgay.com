...more than I thought.  Without trying to get too excited about an announcement to come which will undoubtedly not live up to our excitement, Troy and I went from idea to application in 2 weeks with only about 5 real days of programming.  I am surprised at how much we have learned and how much fun it is to create again (instead of just fixing and tweaking).  There are only a few version 1.0s to happen in new markets.  It is exhilarating.
