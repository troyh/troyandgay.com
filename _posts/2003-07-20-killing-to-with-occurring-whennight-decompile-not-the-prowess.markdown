Today's award for good use of internet: [The Darwinian Poetry site](http://www.codeasart.com/poetry/darwin.html).  In an experiment, this guy has taken 1,000 random words and creates random poems out of them.  You vote between two which poem is better, and he slices the better poem with a new one to make a superior poem.  It will take a hundred of us monkies to see if the computer can eventually create a good poem.  So far the only measurable result is that poems with the word "ship" in them do better.
