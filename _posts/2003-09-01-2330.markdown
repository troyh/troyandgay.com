Trying to continue a relaxing Labor Day weekend, woke up early (7:30am) and had coffee outside. Made blackberry pancakes for breakfast with blackberries from our yard. Rearranged some furniture and then went to install [my new hard drive](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/08/001667.php#001667) in a machine. No luck, a 200GB exceeds the EIDE 137GB limit so I'd lose 63GBs. Argh. Went to wash and vacuum the car with Gay and then took the dogs to the Zoomies drive-in, a Vashon Island fast food place (that should be called "Slowies"), for burgers and fries. They give the dogs free little ice cream cones, which is pretty cute. [Ouzo](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/04/001362.php) hates when we spray [Binaca](http://www.drugstore.com/templates/brand/default.asp?brand=1775&aid=334009&aparam=binaca) in his mouth when [he barks](http://www.papd.org/animal/behavior/quietcommand.html) at pedestrians.

Lunch outside in the end of summer Seattle weather. Back to the hard drive... after learning a lot about IDE and the [137 GB limit](http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/bios/sizeGB128-c.html), and the [BIOS](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/B/BIOS.html) in a circa 1999 machine, just decided to upgrade to a later version of the [Linux kernel](http://kernel.org) and it worked like a charm! Then dinner and the first part of [Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers](http://www.lordoftherings.net/index_400_hv_presell.html). Quiet. Relaxing.
