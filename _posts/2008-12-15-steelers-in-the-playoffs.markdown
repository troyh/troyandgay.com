The Steelers clinched their division yesterday beating the Ravens 13-9 by keeping the Ravens to only 202 yards (no team has gained 300 yards this year) and no touchdowns. The Steelers prove that a good defense is more important than a good offense. If they beat the Titans next week and both either lose or win the last week, they will be the #1 seed in the AFC.
