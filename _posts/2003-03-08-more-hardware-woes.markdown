Yesterday I got the final piece to a new 1U server we're building ([Recipezaar](http://recipezaar.com) is hungry again for more hardware).

Three problems: 1) the case is missing a fanboard, 2) the [motherboard](http://www.msicomputer.com/msiforms/k7n2.asp)'s audio ports are too tall for the 1U case, and 3) a 512MB RAM chip (from Crucial even!) is defective. #1 is the shipper's fault, #2 is my fault and #3 is just a hardware defect.

In 20 years of tinkering with computers, I've never had solid-state hardware just die. But in the last 4 weeks, I've had a defective (ASUS) motherboard, a Apple [Combo Drive die](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/03/001262.php#001262) and now a RAM chip. Are hardware makers getting sloppy?
