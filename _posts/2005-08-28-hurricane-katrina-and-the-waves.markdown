Hurricane Katrina [will hit New Orleans today](http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/12500225.htm) after killing seven people in Florida and will likely kill many more. My parents live in Florida, a place hit by several hurricanes every single year that always kill people. You'd think fewer people would die from hurricanes given the advance notice of them. Yet, in [2004 alone](http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001443.html), 218 people were killed from hurricanes.

Yet my mom fears for _my_ life because I live in an earthquake-prone area. You have to go  [back to 1965](http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/eqlists/us_deaths.html) (40 years!), to match that number of deaths from earthquakes. Between 1965 and 2005, 220 people have been killed in earthquakes in the US. And 188 (85%) were killed in just three of the largest earthquakes.
