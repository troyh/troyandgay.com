Better late than never....

A friend of Gay's from college, [Jasper Alexander](http://www.hattiesrestaurant.com/chefs_corner.htm), was [on The Food Network last year](http://hbtphoto.blogspot.com/2007_01_21_archive.html) with Bobby Flay. Jasper and his wife Beth used to live in Seattle and we went to their wedding back when Gay and I were first dating. He worked at Seattle restaurants before moving to Saratoga Springs, New York several years ago to open their own restaurant, [Hattie's Restaurant](http://www.hattiesrestaurant.com/). Congratulations, Jasper!
