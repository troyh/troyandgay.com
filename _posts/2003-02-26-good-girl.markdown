Saw [Good Girl](http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/thegoodgirl/index.html) last night. I don't like Jennifer Aniston and I think Friends is just about the dumbest show on TV, but this was a really good movie and she was very good in it. But I will never move to Texas.

Going to see [Mulholland Drive](http://www.mulhollanddrive.com/) tonight.
