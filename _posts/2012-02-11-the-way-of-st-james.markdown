We happened across the movie [The Way](http://theway-themovie.com/) tonight on Apple TV and decided to rent it. It was pretty good. I decided that, when the kids are old enough to hike long distances and before they are too old to want to spend a summer with us, we'll take the kids to Spain and walk at least part of the [El Camino de Santiago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Way_of_St._James) trail. It seems like a cool way to visit some towns in Spain. Documenting it here as a [promise](http://troyandgay.com/tag/promise/) to myself.
