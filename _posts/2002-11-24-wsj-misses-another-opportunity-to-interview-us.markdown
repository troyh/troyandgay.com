[WSJ.com - ...Make New Friends](http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB1037221332800393548,00.html?mod=2002%5F2)

I can't believe they use epicurious, whose boards suck!  ...but the rest is true.  We built a community and people made friends.  UPDATE: You've got to check out [GardenWeb](http://www.gardenweb).  It is everything we'd like to be.  They do a lot to support communities and the site is dead simple html.  They claim 13mil pages/month and 1.3 million users, and are profitable.  They do nice advertising (easy buys), and a directory, and subscriptions with some "niceities" just like we want.  very cool!
