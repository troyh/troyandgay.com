CNet has yet another article on [.Mac subscriber growth](http://rss.com.com/2100-1040-960294.html?type=pt&part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news) with a new total of 180,000 subscribers: _...that total pales in comparison with the number of people who used iTools. Before Apple announced plans to replace the free iTools suite of Web services with the paid .Mac service, the company claimed about 2.2 million subscribers._

Why is that bad? An 8% free-to-fee rate is good, especially considering the high annual price. Who thought they'd get 100%??? At $50-100 per subscriber, that's a $9-18 million business. Not bad considering all they do is provide a WebDAV server and web mail.
