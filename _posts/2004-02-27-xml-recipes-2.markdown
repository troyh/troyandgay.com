I'm not sure if [Recipezaar](http://recipezaar.com) is the [only recipe site to support RSS](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2004/02/001919.php#001919), but it's definitely the only recipe site that also supports XML recipes (in [RecipeML](http://www.formatdata.com/recipeml) format and [CookML](http://www.kalorio.de/cml/cookml.html) format) and [RecipeRPC](http://reciperpc.sf.net). FWIW, I don't think there is another recipe site that publishes 100 recipes a day that supports RSS.
