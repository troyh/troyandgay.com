After getting the kids off to school, Gay and I drove to Canby, Oregon to visit JVNW. We stopped in Clackamas for lunch at a McMenamin's (in a strip mall!) with Kevin, our brewer, and then met with the guys at JVNW. It was fun to see the factory, the design and project management areas and then walk through the construction of the tanks at various stages.

We all then went to [Laurelwood](http://laurelwoodbrewpub.com/) in Portland to talk and then Gay and I checked into our hotel before dinner at Higgins. Not sure why, but [the hotel](http://www.thenines.com/?PS=PS_aa_WWC_WestWestCanada_Google_BD_The_Nines_Portland_Exact_060811_NAD_FM) upgraded us to the Meier-Frank suite â€“ woulda been even more great if we stayed more than one night.
