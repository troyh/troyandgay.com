Our [Optimism](http://optimismbrewing.com) [logo designers](http://optimismbrewing.com/news/logo/), Ivan Chermayeff and Tom Geismar, each just won the Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt [Design Award](http://www.cooperhewitt.org/national-design-awards/2014-winners) for Lifetime Achievement. See [Ivan's work](http://ndagallery.cooperhewitt.org/ivanchermayeff?utm_source=) and [Tom's work](http://ndagallery.cooperhewitt.org/tomgeismar). Congratulations to them!

Our architect, Tom Kundig, [won the Design Award for Architecture in 2008](http://www.cooperhewitt.org/tags/tom-kundig). I'm very happy to be fortunate enough to work with such great people in their fields.
