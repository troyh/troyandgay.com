[![wedding stamp](/pix/stamp.jpg)Stamps.com lets you make your own picture stamps](http://photo.stamps.com) out of ANY digital photo.  The cost is roughly $.85/stamp instead of $.37 and there is a $3 shipping charge for each order, but it is so clever and so much better than the flag, bad flowers, and LOVE.  This is an obvious for wedding invitations, baby announcements, businesses, etc. -- I *wish* this would have launched before we'd written most of our thank yous.  (Disclosure: I'm actually a stupid investor in Stamps.com, but that is another blog entry entirely.)
