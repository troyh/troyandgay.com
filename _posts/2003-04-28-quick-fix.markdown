Our new caching mechanism is great, but it requires a huge amount of disk space. We ran out of space in 12 hours after first installing it. And this was on a Sunday, which is a very slow day for the site. We made a quick-and-dirty change to pull disk space from another server. We'll see how long that lasts. In the meantime, we're working on getting more hard disk space. Good thing hard drives are cheap.
