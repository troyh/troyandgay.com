Two days ago, there was a [discussion about a bad review](http://www.ecipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=13754&74) and I suggested a "sportsmanship" ranking that would decrease when people complain about their reviews. Lennie really didn't like it and got very upset and hasn't been back to the Talk boards since (looking at the logs, though, she has been back yesterday to read a lot of Talk posts. :-). Others [came to our defense](http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=13788&27).
