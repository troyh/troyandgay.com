MSFT ass-kiss Paul Andrews makes the bold prediction that [ Microsoft's monopoly is over (well, eroding for the next 10 years)](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/134614233_paul13.html).  He says Linux is cheaper, open source is better, the anti-monopoly backlash is helping, and  itself is contributing to its own failure ("the company moves with elephantine deliberation").

_ At a recent briefing, a senior Microsoft executive derided open source as a "collection of clones." The irony appeared to be lost on him. _
