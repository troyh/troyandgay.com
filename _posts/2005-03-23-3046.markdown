![](http://www.transhumanism.org/tv/2003usa/rameznaam.jpg)My ex-boss at Microsoft, Ramez Naam, wrote a book, [More Than Human](http://morethanhuman.org/), that was just [wrote well-reviewed by Gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/electronic-paper/internet-on-paper-more-than-human-by-ramez-naam-036652.php) and reviewed positively by notables such as Steven Johnson, George Dyson and even [Scientific American](http://morethanhuman.org/reviews/#sciam). Congratulations Mez!

Interestingly, and I had forgotten about this til just this second, it was at one of Mez's parties in 1998 that Gay and I had our first kiss. And our relationship started right after that. Oh, the memories.... :)
