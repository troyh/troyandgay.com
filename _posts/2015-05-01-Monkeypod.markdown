We tried to go to [Monkeypod](http://www.monkeypodkitchen.com/) on Wednesday for dinner but discovered that you can't even get into the place without a reservation, which we didn't make. So we made a reservation for Friday dinner. This is considered by some to be the best (only?) beer restaurant on Maui. The food was excellent, one of the best meals we had here, and the beer selection is fantastic by Hawaii standards (even good by Seattle standards).
