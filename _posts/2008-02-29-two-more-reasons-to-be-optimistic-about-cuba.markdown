Raul Castro, the new President, has "already signed two human rights treaties":http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/01/world/americas/01cuba.html?ex=1362027600&en=ca823ad5997eb8aa&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss:

bq. One of the pacts, the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, guarantees "civil and political freedom," including the right to self-determination, peaceful assembly, freedom of religion, privacy, *freedom to leave a country*, and equal protection before the law.

Does that mean that Cubans can leave Cuba?
