Mom & Dad sent me two books for my birthday: _[Startup](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0140257314/qid=1036098721/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-4669202-2528966?v=glance&n=507846)_ by Jerry Kaplan and by _[One Up on Wall Street](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743200403/qid=1036098765/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-4669202-2528966?v=glance&n=507846)_ by Peter Lynch. Both from my Amazon Wish List. I've already read 3 chapters in _Startup_ and I really like it.
