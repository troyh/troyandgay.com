The [Monorail trails by 3 votes](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/134579080_votetally19m.html). There are 3,200 Seattle ballots left to be counted. These ballots were cast in-person (not absentee) which had a 54% approval average. Monorail propoents are predicting victory and opponents are still conceding. We will know for sure tomorrow.
