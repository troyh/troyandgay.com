![](http://troyandgay.com/pix/IMG_1600.jpg)Just got off a 13-hour flight and sitting in the lounge at the airport in Taipei with free Wi-Fi. :)  It's very weird to be halfway around the world from home and be able to act like you're at your desk, checking email, reading news, IMing, posting a blog entry...

The plane did not even crash _once_ the entire flight. Just one more flight to go til Denpasar on Bali. We met a guy from Virginia here at the airport. He was on the same flight and flew from Richmond to Chicago to Seattle to Taipei.

I had a hard time sleeping on the plane, but got maybe 2-3 hours of sleep off and on. Watched "Dodgeball" (very funny) and "Harry Potter 3".
