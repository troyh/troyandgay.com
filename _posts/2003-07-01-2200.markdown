[Marc Andreessen](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=582&ncid=582&e=1&u=/nm/20030701/wr_nm/tech_internet_andreessen_dc): _There hasn't been any innovation on the browser in the last five years. And five years from now there won't be any changes._

I guess Marc hasn't seen [Safari](http://apple.com/safari) or even the offspring of his own creation, [Mozilla](http://mozilla.org). But he should get back to building a web browser if he has some new ideas.
