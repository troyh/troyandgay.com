Wow, this is a good sign for Linux; Gates shows he [totally misunderstands Linux](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,885510,00.asp). Comparing it to OS/2 or the Mac?  is incompatible? Did he think Win9x, NT and CE were at all compatible? It's not often that Gates completely misses the point about a technology, but it sure sounds like he does here.
