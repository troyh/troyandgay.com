[Recipezaar](http://recipezaar.com) is up to [8,800](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=recipezaar.com) on [Alexa](http://www.alexa.com)'s ranking system. That means there are only 8,799 sites that are bigger in traffic.

It's only one system for ranking sites and isn't always the same as what we see internally, but it's as good a barometer as any. But the most interesting thing is that our biggest competitors ([AllRecipes](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&url=allrecipes.com), [Epicurious](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=epicurious.com), [FoodTV](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=foodtv.com)), with millions of dollars in funding and marketing, are continuing to fall while Recipezaar continues to rise. I remember when they were hundreds of times bigger than us, now they're just 3-4 times bigger. I like the trend.
