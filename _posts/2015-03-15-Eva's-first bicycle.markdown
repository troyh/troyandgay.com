Eva got her first bicycle today at [Montlake Bicycle Shop](http://www.montlakebike.com/) and this weekend I installed our bike wall in the mud room. I put 2 sheets of [Lexan](http://www.sabic-ip.com/gep/Plastics/en/ProductsAndServices/ProductLine/lexan.html) on the wall to protect it from wet/dirty tires and mounted 5 hooks to hold the bikes and keep them out of the way.

The kids are amazed that the bikes "stick" to the wall.
