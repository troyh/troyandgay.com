Epicurious Taste Test
- "costs only $14.95 for a whole year-- that's 52 issues for less than 29 cents an issue!"
- "offers unbiased, authoritative advice, using Epicurious's famous four-fork rating system, on what to buy, where to buy it, and how to use it, and, of course, links to recommended recipes so your food enthusiast can put their products to use right away!" in other words we send you spam for the affiliate products we hawk on the site and in our magazine.
- "...a free gift  -- Epicurious's Top 25 Recipes of 2002: The Editor's Best Picks (an e-premium in PDF format, with a value of $9.95"  ....that's just $.40/recipe!!!  apparantly epicurious recipes are worth more than taste of midwest.
