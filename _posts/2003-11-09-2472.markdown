Gay found [this](http://www.sauria.com/~jjl/blog/archives/000204.html) that mentions this site. The (not so) funny thing is that the idea behind TroyAndGay.com was that we'd both write about the same things so you'd get both our perspectives on things. But nope, Gay won't write about anything that I've written about and if I mention something she also mentioned she gets angry.
