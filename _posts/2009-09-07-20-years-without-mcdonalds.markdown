It's now been [over 20 years](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/17/19-years-without-mcdonalds/) since I've eaten at McDonald's, and greasy fast food in general. This also means that it's been 20 years since I've paid to sit on uncomfortable plastic furniture. Did you know that McDonald's [designs their seating to be uncomfortable](http://www.usnews.com/usnews/tech/nextnews/archive/next031111.htm) so that you leave as soon as possible?: "Give us your money, get out and please come back again."
