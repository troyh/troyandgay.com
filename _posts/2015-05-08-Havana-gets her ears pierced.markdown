When I was young, you got your ears pierced at a shopping mall store or, the way I did it, at home with ice and a needle. Today, tattoo parlors are the recommended place to go. For [Havana's 8th birthday](/2015/04/30/Happy-8th%20Birthday,%20Havana.html), we let her get her ears pierced so this evening we went to [Pierced Hearts](http://www.piercedhearts.com/).

Her doctor, Jeremy:

My beautiful daughter is even more beautiful.
