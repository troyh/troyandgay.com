Today is the last day of the first half of the year. One of my New Year's resolutions was to ride my bike 4 times a week and to do the "long version" of the ride half the time. Well, I should easily accomplish the 4 times a week part, but I have yet to ride the longer route this year. But I think I'm up for it strength-wise (there's a _long_ climb on it), if I could just spare the time it'll take to do the longer route.
