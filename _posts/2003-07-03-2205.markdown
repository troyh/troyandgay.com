![letour2003.gif](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/letour2003.gif)I'm getting excited about the [Tour de France](http://www.letour.fr/indexus.html) that starts this weekend. Lance Armstrong is being [his usual modest self](http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=ap-tour-armstrong&prov=ap&type=lgns) and [trying to stay calm](http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-dc&prov=reuters&type=lgns). I think [Simoni](http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-toursimoni_sports_feature&prov=reuters&type=lgns) is his biggest threat, but [Ullrich](http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-tourullrich_sports_feature&prov=reuters&type=lgns) may be closer to his top form of '97 (which was amazing) and [Botero](http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-tourbotero_sports_feature&prov=reuters&type=lgns) will be interesting to watch. Last  year, I thought he had it sewn up from the start, but I have a feeling this year could be more difficult.
