It's Havana's week to be "The Big Cheese" at school. She shared information about herself, she made her big board of photos that tell her story and got to sit in the special chair all week. Families are invited during the week to meet the kids and for the kids to learn about us. We took Hudson and Eva with some cupcakes and after they "interviewed" us, Gay read the class a book.
