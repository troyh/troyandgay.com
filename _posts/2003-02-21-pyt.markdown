![](http://www.michaeljackson.com/images/cvr-silver.jpg)Micheal Jackson might be a little strange, but his plastic surgery is his own damn business -- he has to live with that nose -- and I really don't believe he  did anything more than sleep in the same bed as those kids.  While he may not the best father (kid out the window), he hires nurses for that job.  He is certainly a great friend of children; mainly because he has not grown up himself.  This documentary guy was out to [manipulate Jackson just like the father of the kid he settled the sexual abuse case](http://www.steveharvey.com/michaeljackson.htm).  Poor Michael.
