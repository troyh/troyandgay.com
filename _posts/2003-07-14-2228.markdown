[![letour2003.gif](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/letour2003.gif)](http://letour.fr/) [Lance did take the yellow jersey](http://www.velonews.com/tour2003/details/articles/4505.0.html) today, but didn't look as strong as expected on Alpe d'Huez. He barely increased his lead over Beloki but did increase his lead over Ullrich. And Simoni lost almost 13 minutes!
