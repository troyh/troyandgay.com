Today is our 7th wedding anniversary. 7 years have passed, just like that. It's been a good 7 years! I hope there's many many more.

With everything going on lately, we keep forgetting about it and haven't planned anything to celebrate tonight and didn't get each other any gifts. Maybe we'll go out Tuesday night to celebrate it when we get a chance with Kelly here to go out without the kids.
