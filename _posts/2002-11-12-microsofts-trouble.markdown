[The Economist](http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1429537): _Microsoft's greatest challenge, like IBM's before it, could be internal: how to transform itself._

I think this is true, Microsoft's arrogant culture is way too ingrained to the company that it simply can't be changed.

The Register also has an [article](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/54/28056.html) on Palm versus  and why (Palm believes) PocketPC will fail: _Manufacturers going the Microsoft way therefore have little scope for differentiation, are forced to compete on price, and will get killed. Not that many of them are doing so - while the already-anointed PC ringwraiths have moved into the PocketPC market, the handset companies have looked at the model, looked at the history books and beaten a swift retreat._
