In today's time trial, Lance Armstrong [took the lead](http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=ap-dauphinelibere&prov=ap&type=lgns) in the [Dauphiné-Libéré](http://www.dauphine-libere.com/) race today. He beat David Millar by a minute even! The race ends on Sunday, but Lance is demonstrating that he's in good form for the Tour in July.
