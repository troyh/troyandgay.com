We live on Vashon, little else does.  However, one of Washington States best wineries is here (the grapes are grown in Eastern Washington and shipped here to be fermented, etc.).  So we take a little pride when [Andrew Will winery gets a mention](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/foodwine/2001211130_andrewwill230.html).
