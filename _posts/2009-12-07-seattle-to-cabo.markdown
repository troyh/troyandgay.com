We got up early, got the kids in the car and on the 8am ferry for our 10:30am flight to Cabo. We flew Alaska Airlines, home of the surly stewardess. Hudson was asleep on Gay's lap when they were serving food so she asked the stewardess to put Havana's tray table up. The stewardess refused. I had to unbuckle my seat belt, even though we were still required to keep them on, get up and and put her tray up. It wasn't that hard. They gave us a [digEplayer](http://www.alaskaair.com/as/www2/Flights/digEplayer.asp), a portable video device, and one of ours didn't work so we asked for a replacement. 10 minutes later the stewardess brought a replacement and gave it to the guy in the row in front of us instead who stopped her before he got to us. She never came back. We had to ask a second time for a replacement. I wish a better airline had their hub in Seattle.

The kids were happy and content most of the flight. Their ears were hurting as we ascended and descended and we couldn't figure out how to communicate to him to yawn or open his jaw enough to pop his ears so he was cranky about that. He also got antsy in the last hour and insisted on walking up and down the aisle. He just learned to walk so he loves to practice. It's interesting to see how different people react to kids. Some people look at them like they're an animal they've never seen before and some people want to play with them.

We got our rental car, a [Dodge Journey](http://www.dodge.com/en/2009/journey/), which I'd never even heard of before, and drove the 40 minutes to our place outside of Cabo.
