[The Economist](http://www.economist.com/business/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1699434) on Linux. The correctly recognize that Sun & Oracle are both in serious trouble. And I'm glad they pointed out Microsoft's [FUD](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci214113,00.html): 1) that Windows is as cheap as Linux but recently offered a cheaper version of Windows for servers to better compete and 2) that open source will destroy innovation from big companies although big companies never have been the innovative ones in the first place.
