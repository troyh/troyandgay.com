Today Hudson is 3 months old. He's still a much easier baby than Havana was. He's quiet and rarely cries (just like his dad). He can roll over when put down on his tummy and is patient as Havana pokes, prods and hugs him. He even sleeps through the night, i.e., 5 hours, on occasion which is much earlier than I remember Havana sleeping through the night.
