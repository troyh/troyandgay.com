Saw [Comedian](http://www.miramax.com/comedian/) last night. It was funny and very entertaining, but too short. Fortunately, the DVD had extras that were also good including two interviews with [Jiminy Glick](http://www.comedycentral.com/press/imagegallery/sgallery.jhtml?s=pglk), aka Martin Short, that were hilarious.

It was especially interesting to compare the modest and much funnier Seinfeld to [Orny Adams](http://www.ornyadams.com/pages/875335/), a lousy comedian with a huge ego.
