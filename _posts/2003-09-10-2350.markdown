[S1m0ne](http://www.s1m0ne.com/) sucked. Hollywood is fake, plastic, naive, and more than a little stupid, so when Hollywood tries to expose itself, you get a plastic story filled with naive characters and lots of stupidity. But don't despair, you still get the obligatory rekindled relationship happiness and the "Who am I and what is life about?" drivel that Hollywood thinks pass for meaning. And what was [Al Pacino](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199/) thinking?
