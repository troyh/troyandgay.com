Hmmm.... it seems that the US military is a [bunch](http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/story.jsp?story=452375) of [jerks](http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/story.jsp?story=452375). Reminds me of the recent PBS [Frontline](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/truth/) that showed the military crushing an Iraqi's car because he was looting. It turned out that he was a taxi driver and he was carrying wood on top of it, presumably to rebuild his war-damaged house. But the GIs sure had a ball  destroying his car and playing it up to the camera while he watched.
