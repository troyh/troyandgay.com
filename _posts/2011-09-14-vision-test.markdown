I've noticed that I need to hold things farther away from my eyes when reading, so knew I'd need reading glasses soon. We went to our friendly neighborhood Costco for a vision test this afternoon and I got a prescription for reading glasses, picked out some frames and for just $117, should have my glasses next week.

I learned that I have [astigmatism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism#Ophthalmic_astigmatism), but otherwise, my eyes are healthy and I don't have a need for full-time glasses yet.
