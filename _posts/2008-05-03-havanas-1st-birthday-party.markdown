Gay's mom, dad and aunt came over from Spokane on Friday and we had a full house and good food for Havana's 1st birthday party on Saturday. Havana got tons of presents too. Thanks to everyone!

I hardly took any photos but hopefully we can get the photos from others' cameras and post them in "the photoset":http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/sets/72157604879923100/. Our wedding photographer was also there taking photos, which I'm sure turned out better than mine.
