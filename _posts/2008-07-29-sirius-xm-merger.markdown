Sirius and XM finally got [FCC approval](http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/the-tech-observer/2008/07/29/no-more-static-sirius-and-xm-complete-merger) to merge. Supposedly by Fall, I'll be able to listen to whatever station I want in both cars. Imagine that. It took the federal government 16 months to decide that's a benefit to consumers.
