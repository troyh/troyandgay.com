People are [starting to warm up](http://news.com.com/2100-1026-991164.html?tag=fd_top) to the idea of paying for online content. In the US, $1.3 billion was spent on online subscription services: _"Whether or not consumers will pay for content is no longer a matter of debate. Clearly, they will." _

The early successes are online dating sites, financial services and entertainment/lifestyle. These are all things that the web can do much better than offline versions, which is why they are successful. [Recipes](http://recipezaar.com) fit well into that model, me thinks. Maybe this will (finally) be the decade that publishers stop using expensive dead trees and start using cheap recycled electrons.
