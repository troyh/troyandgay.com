The dishonesty cited in this [NYT article](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/15/technology/15SOFT.html?pagewanted=1&th) and the recent [lying about the iLoo](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoft/134731106_iloo14.html) by Microsoft gets under my skin. I'm not so naive as to believe corporations are altruistic, but I do expect them to not be outright liars, especially when their marketing budget used to push the lies exceeds the GDP of many countries.

The Microsoft employees posing as non-Microsoft employees at conferences reminds me of the time I went to a Netscape conference in 1997 as a Microsoft employee. I attended a talk about Netscape's mail server product with another Microsoft employee and during the Q&A period, my coworker took off his badge (that said "Microsoft" on it), asked me to take mine off, and then he got up and asked a question intended to imply to the audience that Netscape was lying about their product. He knew and I knew that Netscape wasn't lying, but the audience probably was less sure. I'm not purporting that this is the reason Netscape died as a company, but it was one of the many things I was involved with at Microsoft that just left a bad taste in my mouth.
