My iPad 2 finally arrived. I ordered it on the Monday after the Friday it was released, when[ I didn't get one at the local store](http://troyandgay.com/2011/03/11/ipad-2-day/). Almost 4 weeks later, it arrived. My SmartCover arrived a couple weeks ago.

It's quite a bit faster than the older iPad and I really like how the SmartCover props it up for typing. But why doesn't iTunes sync the app organization?!? It took me an hour to rearrange all my installed apps.
