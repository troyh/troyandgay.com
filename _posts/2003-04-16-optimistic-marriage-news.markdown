Normally, I wouldn't bother too much with the status of someone's marriage, but this is bigger than a marriage, it's about the Tour. I'm glad that [Lance Armstrong and his wife are reconciling](http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=ap-armstrong-marriage&prov=ap&type=lgns). I'd really like to see him win a 5th straight Tour de France this year and go on to do what no one has ever done and win a 6th next year. Did I ever mention that I met Lance at the start of Stage 2 of the Tour DuPont in 1995?
