This [NYT article](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/29/technology/circuits/29PHON.html) describes that what we did by going to cellular may be a new trend: _Nearly 3 percent of telephone users have made wireless phones their primary telephone_.

So we only need a land line for TiVo, but [this HOWTO](http://pvrhack.sonnik.com/tivo/howto/tivo-dsl.htm) describes how to make TiVo update itself over an internet connection instead of dialing out. This could save us $30/mo.
