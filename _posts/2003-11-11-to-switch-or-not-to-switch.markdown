Since Red Hat's announcement that they aren't supporting free editions of Red Hat Linux, I've been considering switching to another Linux distribution, with [Debian](http://debian.org) at the top of the list. Then, along comes [Bruce Perens and his UserLinux](http://www.nat.org/), which will be based on Debian. Nice.

Incidentally, that Wired article referenced [Nat Friedman](http://www.nat.org/) of [Ximian](http://www.ximian.com). I remembered that he offered me a job as a "VP of Technology" (I hope I am never a VP of anything) a few years ago. I wonder how much [Novell stock](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=novl) I'd own right now if I had switched.
