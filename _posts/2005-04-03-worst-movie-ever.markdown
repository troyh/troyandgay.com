There's only two ways [I Heart Huckabees](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/i_heart_huckabees/) can be a positive: 1) you save time by not watching it or 2) you watch it to convince others to save time by not to watching it. Roger Ebert [said it well](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041007/REVIEWS/40920003/1023):



<blockquote>
This may be the first movie that can exist without an audience between the projector and the screen. It falls in its own forest, and hears itself. It's the kind of movie that would inspire a Charlie Kaufman screenplay about how it couldn't be made.</blockquote>
