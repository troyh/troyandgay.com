[Recipezaar](http://recipezaar.com) broke the 10,000 barrier on [Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/data/details?q=recipezaar&p=DestSearch_W_t_40_M1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.recipezaar.com%2F)! We're now at 9,610. This means that if you ranked all the web sites in popularity, we're the 9,610th most popular site. Not bad for a couple geeks banging away on computers above their garage, and considering that there are zillions of sites on the web. :)

Of course, this is just one web ranking system and no ranking system is perfectly accurate, so it must be taken with a pinch of salt. But it's as good a metric as any. I also love that we have a great 5-star review rating on Alexa, more total reviews and more 5-stars than any of our competitors.
