We watched [K19: The Widowmaker](http://www.k19movie.com/) last night. It's a true story about a Soviet nuclear submarine in 1961 that had problems with the nuclear reactor powering the sub on its maiden voyage intended to strike fear in the hearts of America with the Soviet's nuclear power and strike potential.

It was intended to be very suspenseful, but it wasn't. This was probably because we know that nothing nuclear happened in 1961 off the coast of the US so we assume that everything was resolved satisfactorily. Harrison Ford's Russian accent was kinda weak and faded in and out at times and Liam Neeson's Russian accent didn't exist, making it even harder to believe. And, of course, there's a lot of "Communists are cold and heartless people bent on the destruction of the US" rhetoric typical of Hollywood cold war movies.
