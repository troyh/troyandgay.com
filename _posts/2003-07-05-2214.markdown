Coincidentally, [Equilibrium](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/Equilibrium-1118792/) and [Punch-Drunk Love](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/07/001550.php#001550) both have [Emily Watson](http://www.imdb.com/Name?Watson,%20Emily) in them. _Equilibrium_ is a sci-fi movie about a world where the government, in order to create peace, drugs the populace to remove their emotions -- emotions cause evil, of course. [Christian Bale](http://www.imdb.com/Name?Bale,+Christian) is part of an elite police force trying to destroy "the underground" of people who refuse to take the drug. But after forgetting to take his daily drug, gets his emotions back and rebels against the government. The plot is not all that new ("Fahrenheit 451"), but the acting is very good, the story is entertaining and the action is well-done. In a world of _The Matrix_ clones, this movie has some original, albeit unrealistic, fight scenes.
