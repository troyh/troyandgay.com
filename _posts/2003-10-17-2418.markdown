![alicia-01.jpg](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/alicia-01.jpg)Karen and her daughter, [Alicia](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/alicia.html), arrived last night. We've been working with Karen all day (she gets up _very_ early) and Alicia's been playing with the dog, watching TV, browsing the web, and hopefully not getting too bored. Karen's as nice as we expected, and even more down-to-earth than we expected. Alicia is an adorable girl who is the friendliest and well-adjusted "almost 14 year old" girl I know. What's striking is the relationship Karen & Alicia have (and they'd probably be embarrassed if they read this)... Alicia clearly loves her mom and they are simply good friends joking with each other all the time. Maybe I shouldn't be so terrified of having a teenager?
