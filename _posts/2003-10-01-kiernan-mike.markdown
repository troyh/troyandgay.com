![0312304218.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/0312304218.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg)Old friends Kiernan and Mike were out for dinner on Friday.  These friends seem to be on a US tour: Seattle > New York > Seattle > San Francisco > Seattle ...and they plan on moving back to SF after Mike completes his year assisting [9th circuit appellate Judge Richard Tallman](http://www.google.com/search?q=9th+circuit+judge+%22richard+tallman%22&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8).  Mike used to (unfavorably) cover the Microsoft beat for [The Seattle Weekly](http://www.seattleweekly.org) and is now characterized as the Weekly's "most nakedly ambitious writer ever" by his ex-editor in [Seattle and the Demons of Ambition](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312304218/recipezaar-20) -- I'm as provincial as the next Seattlite, but it is an oxymoronic title...

We'll just have to enjoy them while they are here.
