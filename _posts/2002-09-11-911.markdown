1 year ago today, terrorists attacked the United States. Today, its all cleaned up, the Taliban in Afghanistan is out of power and a new government is in place, Al-Qaeda is significantly hampered, Osama bin Laden may or may not be dead, several top-level Al-Qaeda people are either dead or are in custody, and Bush is seriously interested in invading Iraq and removing Hussein.

Hopefully, in one more year, Osama bin Laden will be dead or captured, Al-Qaeda is a laughing stock, Islamic fundamentalists are shunned by Muslims, and Saddam Hussein is out of power in Iraq.
