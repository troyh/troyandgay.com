Weblogs, Inc founder, Jason Calacanis says that [real entrepreneurs don't raise venture capital](http://calacanis.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000443030938/). I agree. Build your business with your own two hands, it's more rewarding and fun. You learn a lot more which will help you in the later years of your business.

BTW, notice the Google ads on the top of the page -- they're all for VCs. I think that proves Jason's point.
