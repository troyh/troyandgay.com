Googling for something, I happen to find a link to a Belle & Sebastian (the kings of [wuss rock](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Wuss%20Rock)) video on YouTube. Then I found a video for one of my favorite songs of all time!:

The video's pretty cheap quality-wise, but I can never get enough of the horns and guitar instrumental part in the middle. And there's plenty more B&S videos where that came from.

This one is the first B&S video I ever saw. Gay and I were in London in 1998, we never got onto London time and we fell asleep in the hotel room and about 5am with MTV on and I was woken up to this video:

I'm always reminded of that trip to London whenever I hear that song.

[Another video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZjZ91E6fdE) has this priceless photo:
