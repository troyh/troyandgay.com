The Iraqi UN Ambassador [declared](http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/04/09/sprj.irq.war.main/index.html) that the war is over and [the Iraqi people are fighting against the Baath party](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/09/international/worldspecial/09CND-BAGH.html). I guess the end is just a formality at this point.

But where's Saddam?
