Eva is 8 months old today. She scoots around on the floor pretty well these days, not up on her knees crawling around, but she's quick nonetheless. She can feed herself finger food and like Havana and Hudson, loves [Mum Mums](http://www.mummums.com/). She is just starting to learn to wave goodbye.

Eric happened to be in town from New York and spent a couple nights with us.
