We haven't had a date night in a while, so we went out tonight since Elysian's 2nd beer of their [12 Beers of the Apocalypse](http://www.washingtonbeerblog.com/elysian-brewing-preparing-for-apocalypse/) release party was also happening. We got to Elysian about 10 minutes before 6pm and there was no line but all the tables were taken. We waited 10 minutes or so and then got a table within view of the festivities, kinda. I had the Rapture Heather Ale and watched Dick Cantwell, dressed as a Pope, give his speech.

We decided to not have dinner at Elysian and instead walk over to [Restaurant Zoë](http://restaurantzoe.com/), which has just opened again after being closed for their move from Belltown to Capitol Hill. We used to go to Zoë for any special occasion before we moved to Vashon and a few times since. I'm glad to have it open again and much closer to home. The new place's decor is less "New York" (sophisticated, contemporary) and more "west coast" (casual, rustic) and the prices are a little lower. I liked the old place, but I like the new place too, and it's more spacious, which I prefer. The old place had a great Ahi Tuna appetizer and a hangar steak that I always ordered, but they don't have either on the new menu. That's too bad. We had their "Regrade Manhattan" and I had the burger, both were very good.
