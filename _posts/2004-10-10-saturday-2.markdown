We're both getting tired of Ubud. So we spent most of the day at the villa by the pool and reading. Fortunately, the chainsaws were only running part of the day. We went into Ubud for lunch and came right back home for more nothing-doing. And it was a humid day with little or no breeze. I was sweating just sitting in a chair and couldn't drink enough water. This is DC-style humidity. I'm ready to see the beach (and the breeze off the water) again.
