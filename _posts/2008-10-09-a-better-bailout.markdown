Just like "I wondered about":http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/09/27/the-bailout/ a couple weeks ago, Paulson is "considering investing in banks":http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122355427239518855.html. This is a lot less risky than buying bad loans, so it is much better for the tax-payers. Hopefully, as an investor in banks, tax-payers can throw out the executives who are clearly not competent enough to run the banks. But I doubt it.
