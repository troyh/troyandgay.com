Every time this part comes on I turn it up as loud as I can:


<blockquote>What can be said of the whiskey and wine  
Random abandon or ballast for joy  
That was scuppered with trust  
Little more than a boy   
And besides I’m in excellent company

I’m reaching the age
When decisions are made
On the life
And the liver

And I'm sure, last ditch
That I'll ask for more time   
But Mother forgive me  
I still want a bottle of good Irish whiskey</blockquote>


Great song. [Listen and watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dELKUivJo4w), the best part starts at 3:25.
