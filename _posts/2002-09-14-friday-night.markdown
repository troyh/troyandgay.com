Went into Seattle, opened an account at Wells Fargo (for moving our AmEx money to), went to B&N and bought a couple books (_John Bogle on Investing: The first 50 years_ and _The Millionaire Next Door_), went to dinner with Sean at 1220 on Capitol Hill, had a couple beers at The Stumbling Monk and came home.

Also had 802.11 access at various places in the city. Very cool!
