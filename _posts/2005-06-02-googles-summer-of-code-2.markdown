Google's [Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html) offers students $4,500 to work on open source projects this summer. Very cool. That's $1,500 for each of three months of the summer, or $9.38/hr. When I was in college, I worked as a night security guard in an office building (which requires doing absolutely nothing, so I got paid to do homework) and was paid $9/hr. Granted, that was 1990 dollars, but if I could have been paid to work on Apache, Mono, Subversion, Nmap, etc., wow.
