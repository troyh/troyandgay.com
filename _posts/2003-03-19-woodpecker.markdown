There's a woodpecker that has found an interest in a vent outlet on our roof and it sounds like a jackhammer when he pecks at it and it vibrates down the vent tube. Very annoying. How do you encourage a woodpecker to not peck at something?

Wow, already got [some ideas](http://www.alaweb.com/~kenwood/saba/yard/woodpeckers.htm); #2 sounds like it would work. Thanks [CanaryGirl](http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=44372)!
