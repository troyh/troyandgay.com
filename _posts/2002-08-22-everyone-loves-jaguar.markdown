PC Magazine has a [short review](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,478824,00.asp) of the 17" iMac and Jaguar. I'm pretty excited about Jaguar! New York Times even [reviews Jaguar](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/22/technology/circuits/22STAT.html): _This is a polished, innovative and ? if such a term can be applied to something as nerdy as an operating system ? exciting upgrade._ ... _Apple is not Microsoft that's the understatement of the year and isn't nearly so Big Brotherish._ ... _Mac OS X 10.2 is the best-looking, least-intrusive and most thoughtfully designed operating system walking the earth today_.
