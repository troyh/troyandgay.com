Salon's running a pretty provocative piece that argues that [ Mozilla not only clobbered the Netscape browser, that it continues what it started: making a platform to rival Windows](http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/09/10/browser_wars/index.html).  Now who knows whether this XUL programming language is any easier to use than IE.Net or whatever, and I don't know if I really want a HTML-based calendar, but the fact that it is open and there are things like SourceForge sure make it fun and a quick spread.  Heck, blogging is an app, and it runs fine in a browser...Open source can do things like this...You gotta wonder...Mozilla over Windows:  Its a good thing ;-)
