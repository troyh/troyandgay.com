Had Gary & [Nancy](http://nancysipple.mywindermere.com/) & [Heather](http://heatherbrynn.mywindermere.com/index.cfm?resetclient=1&CFID=1958143&CFTOKEN=51741130) & Larry ("Leather & Harry") over for dinner last night and played Trivial Pursuit. Too much wine. Nancy brought a delicious dessert over, unfortunately the recipe came from Bon Appetit.
