[Tour de France 2005: O'Reilly drug claims launch Armstrong doping inquiry in France](http://www.tdfblog.com/2005/01/oreilly_drug_cl.html). I don't imagine this will sway Lance to ride in the Tour this year. The French authorities just don't want to accept that he's not doping. It must suck to work hard, be successful and have to listen to losers criticize your every move.
