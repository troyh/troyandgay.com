I happen to find "this blog":http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/11/kindle-20-to-hi.html on Wired.com googling for "Kindle 2.0" and thought the photo was familiar. It turns "it's one of mine":http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2584801338/. At least he credited me with the photo.[![](http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/picture-11.png)](http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/picture-11.png)
