  1. I'm thankful that I spend morning, noon and night with Gay every day and yet I want to spend more time with her. I'm thankful for her and for her willingness to be in my life.

	
  2. My kids who teach me over and over how much I love being alive. They also teach me over and over that I must continually improve myself.

	
  3. Our house. For the first time in my life, I feel like I live in a home. And I'm thankful that I got to be so involved in its renovation and had so much fun doing it working with great people.

	
  4. The Pacific Northwest. I am thankful that I get to live in one of the most beautiful, and reasonably-populated, places in the world.

	
  5. I am thankful that I had the opportunity to pursue my life's dreams and to shape my life the way I wanted to. And even more thankful that I still have that freedom.

	
  6. I'm healthy; I'm thankful for the knowledge that one day I won't be.

	
  7. Beer. It's the icing on the cake for me and I (usually) don't drink as much of it as I'd like to.

	
  8. Programming. It's exercise for my brain that I've enjoyed for a lifetime. I feel like a kid when I get to write code and solve new little problems.

	
  9. My home gym. I wouldn't exercise if it weren't for convenient access to exercise equipment. It's my daily addiction. And I'm thankful specifically for the specific equipment I have that makes exercise fun.

	
  10. My doctors at PacMed. My life today (and tomorrow) is better because of them.
