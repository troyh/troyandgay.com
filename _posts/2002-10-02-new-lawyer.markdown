Went into Seattle to meet with John Bender at Holland & Knight. John has much better credentials than Jeff Thomas and was recommended by two other well-regarded lawyers (Chris Wells and Frank Huebner). It went very well; John is very experienced and smart, plus his assistant, David Ebel, is also smart.

Now, how do I tell Jeff Thomas we won't be needing his services?
