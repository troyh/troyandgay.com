The survey of the property complete, we are back to working with the architects to talk about location and basic structure of the house.

According to the survey, our property rises 50 feet (5 stories!) from the lowest point to the highest point. It sure doesn't feel like that big a slope when you walk it, though. This makes it difficult to place the house given that moving dirt to level the grade is expensive and not always feasible.

They've worked up a couple ideas for the basic structure and location for the house, we gave our feedback and we'll have another iteration soon.
