![hula.jpg](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/hula.jpg)[Troy stole my life and blogged about it](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2004/04/001979.php#001979).  What you can't tell from the photo of the shakers I received is that they are joined by a little magnet at the hip.
Funny: I sent "people" shakers too. The hula people lift up out of their little grass skirts too. They must have crossed each other somewhere across the Pacific Ocean!
