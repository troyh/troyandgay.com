[iVillage](http://www.ivillage.com) [announced](http://biz.yahoo.com/djus/020729/200207291148000532_1.html) it will drop pop-up ads on their site because 92% of users find them annoying (only 92%?).

Incidentally, iVillage lost $48 million in 2001 on revenues of $60 million. It costs $108 million/yr to run iVillage?!
