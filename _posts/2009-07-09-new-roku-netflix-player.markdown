The Roku (pronounced "Row-koo", not "Rock You", I've discovered) player [we got 13 months ago](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/06/03/roku-netflix-player/), one month past the 1-year warranty, died last Friday. They wouldn't replace it so I ordered a replacement. Good thing they're only $100. I tested the power supply and it was delivering the correct voltage so I assumed it was the box itself. I was wrong.

I got the new one today and tried the new power supply and it does work. Hmmm. Maybe the amperage is wrong? I can't test that. Well, with a replacement power supply, we will have two and can use the old one elsewhere. It's a great device, otherwise.
