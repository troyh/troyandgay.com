[Colbert Report](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIU0Jwu54w): A congressman who sponsored a bill to display the 10 Commandments in a judicial building can't name a better building than a courtroom to display them (a Church is a _worse_ place to display them?), but more importantly, wants our justice system to follow 10 rules that he doesn't even know. If he hasn't even read the 10 Commandments, can we believe he's read the bill he is trying to push through Congress?

Congress just [secretly voted](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003059851_watch14.html) to give themselves another pay-raise, something they've done ever year for 7 years, while [voting against a minimum-wage increase](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/21/AR2006062101069.html?nav=rss_politics), something they've done every year for 9 years. If we're paying their salaries, is it too much to ask that they actually spend some time reading the things they endorse?

Argh! I hate politics. Why do I even bother to find something positiveÂ  in the political news?
