Idiots in Congress (some heavily funded by good 'ol ) "decided" that [the US Govt should not fund any software projects that result in GPL code](http://www.wired.com/news/linux/0,1411,55989,00.html). But [Lawrence Lessig](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/archives/2002_10.shtml#000586) correctly explains the absurdity: _Giving up proprietary control is the price GPLd code demands, just as all-the-money-in-the-world is the price  would demand for similar access to its OS source. Some can pay that price; some cannot._
