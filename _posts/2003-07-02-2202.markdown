<a href="[![ichat-01.jpg](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/ichat-01.jpg)](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/ichat.html)I iChat'd with my brother last night, who is 3,000 miles away. The quality of iChat + iSight is stunning. I've done video conferences with people on high-end equipment before and this is far better both in sound and picture quality. The video quality still isn't TV quality, but it is close and does 30 frames per second (which is what TV does). I have seen the future of telecommunication and this is it.

Now I just wish I knew more people with Macs to chat with. ![](/img/smile.gif)
