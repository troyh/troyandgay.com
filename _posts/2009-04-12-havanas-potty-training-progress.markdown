For the first time in her life, Havana didn't wear a diaper today. She wore "big girl underpants" as the next step in her potty-training. It wasn't a successful step, she had a few mistakes and ended the day in a diaper. But she was very proud of herself!

She almost always uses the toilet for #2 and about half of her #1s. My guess is that in 6 months she won't be wearing diapers anymore.
