[Pam Oliver](http://www.amiannoying.com/(hcup0045wmhmvn2tcksrct55)/view.aspx?ID=6372) interviewing Eagles running back, Duce Staley: "They call you the workhorse. That's a compliment to me. That tells me you're saying 'Give me the ball, I'll do the work'".

[Joe Buck](http://www.timmccarver.com/guest-4.html) talking about the Carolina QB: "He is an actor in the class of Jack Nicholson, Robert DeNiro, Keanu Reeves."
