After a 6-day electrical outage last December we decided to get a fat generator to power the entire house for 2-3 days at a time. The "Onan":http://www.cumminsonan.com/ 30,000kW genset was delivered early summer and we're _finally_ getting it installed. This week we had a concrete pad built and today we had the generator placed on it.

Next is the electrical work and getting a propane tank installed to power it.
