I happened across [TurboTax for the web](http://taxes.yahoo.com/filing.html) today. We need more web applications and this is a perfect application for the web -- it's always up-to-date data-wise, bugs can be fixed immediately, no downloads necessary, etc. The only downside is that you're giving a corporation (Intuit) very personal info about yourself, which is not usually a good idea. But I wish QuickBooks and Quicken were also web apps (Quicken is well on its way already, though).
