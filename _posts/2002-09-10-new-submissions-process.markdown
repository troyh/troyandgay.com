The new submissions process for recipes went into effect. Recipes submitted on the site now go into the database rather than to text files. This makes it easier to work with the submissions, makes it possible to show users the status of their submissions and even edit their submissions, although we don't yet do that. Eventually, all submissions (reviews and photos) will work this way too.
