When we got home yesterday, Hudson's eye was pink and infected and he had a fever. It looked like [pink eye](https://health.google.com/health/ref/Conjunctivitis). The pediatrician wanted to get a look at him to see if he had an ear infection or even strep throat, so we scheduled an appointment for today so I decided to go with and do more work at the house. This morning, he looked much better but we went anyway. He's fine, no ear infection or strep throat.

Gay dropped me off at the house and I got a couple hours to hang out and put up some blocking in the basement.Â Hudson got to spend some time with us without Havana around too. He's almost a different person when Havana's not taking all the attention.
