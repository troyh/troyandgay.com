This is probably how [the kiss](http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1477729/08282003/spears_britney.jhtml?headlines=true) happened:

_Madonna, an expert at crafting moments like these, was likely the kiss architect, and didnt have to clear it with anyone but herself. Britney on the other hand probably deferred Madonnas plan to her managers, who then held target-marketing studies, clicked through a series of PowerPoint pie charts in dimly-lit conference rooms, crunched Excel spreadsheet numbers, calibrated their Britney-Coming-Of-Age barometer to see if the time was right for such a display (sexy enough to titillate the kids, while toned-down enough to bypass conservative, middle-America parental units), tabulated the results to arrive at yes, stuck a wind-up key in Britneys back, turned it clockwise a few turns, and pushed her out on stage to seal the deal._ [via [What Do I Know](http://whatdoiknow.org/archives/001139.shtml)]
