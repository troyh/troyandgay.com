It was one of the most exciting first weeks of a Tour, but once Froome and Contador crashed out and abandoned, the winner was all but set and it became a race for 2nd place. And Americans Talansky and (Tacoma, WA native) Van Garderen had tough races, although finishing 5th is still good. But I'm sad to see it over nevertheless. 

Nibali was a great winner, attacking even with a commanding lead already. It was an impressive victory and Nibali is one of only 6 people to win all 3 Grand Tours. Hard to believe his coach [wrote him a letter this year](http://www.cyclingquotes.com/news/vinokourov_criticizes_nibali_in_internal_letter/) telling him he's disappointed.
