We took the 10:10a ferry, made a couple stops including one at The Beer Junction where I picked up some great winter beers -- the fall/winter beer season seems to get better every year! We went to the Schuchart/Dow office, saw Doug and Katie and dropped off Thanksgiving gifts for them and Jim, and then went to the house to check on the progress and drop off Thanksgiving gifts for the guys there.

More windows are boarded up so from the outside it looks like it's a condemned house and it's dark inside. Plumbing and electrical rough-in work has begun, the basement floor etching was being done and they were still working on the attic structural work. The attic work will take at least another week and the plumbing and electrical work should be finished the week after Thanksgiving. That's when I can do the low-voltage work.

On the way home, we stopped at [Talarico's](http://www.talaricoswest.com/Talaricos/Home.html) to get pizza for dinner. Mark recommended the place and said the pizzas are large. [He wasn't kidding](http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5188710448/in/photostream/), I've never seen a bigger pizza! I couldn't even fit the box through the door to our house without angling it.
