[Slashdot](http://slashdot.org) is [adding](http://slashdot.org/articles/03/03/06/1548245.shtml?tid=124) to their subscription offering. Now, you get access to new stories 10-20 minutes before non-subscribers. I like Slashdot and could be convinced to pay for it, but is this the best they can do for subscribers? Slashdot is late as it is. I find the news from RSS feeds and [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire) long before Slashdot gets it posted, sometimes by a day or two (!) -- 10-20 minutes is not a great benefit.

Why don't they offer useful services like a summary of the week's news along with the highly-moderated discussions posts (not everyone reads Slashdot 5 times a day), more customized news filtering, email notifications of specific articles, etc.
