Seniors at Havana's school wrote and recorded an original song, created a dance, got the faculty on board to teach the entire school the dance over several weeks, arranged to have their inspiration, [Matt Harding](http://www.wherethehellismatt.com/videos), visit to teach him the dance and produced this video to document the entire thing.

The only thing my senior class ever organized was to vandalize school property with our class name.

Havana can be seen near the 1 minute mark as shown here:
