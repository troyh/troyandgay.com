I just bought a couple of things I'm absolutely in love with:

half-pint glasses (for kid-size beer)

[<img src="http://www.masonpearson.com/main_pic.jpg"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006FI0HY/qid=1145513713/sr=8-5/ref=pd_bbs_5/102-8472503-0653718?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance&n=284507)
My stylist has been recommending Mason Pearson hair brushes for years to me, but I could never imagine spending a bunch on a brush (!), but this brush really is amazing.  Smoother than any other brush ever, and it will last for many years with proper care.  It really is better than any brush or comb I've ever had, and makes my hair fall smooth and straight.  It is most amazing that the brush itself (and all of its packaging) has not changed since the brushes were first made in 1905.
