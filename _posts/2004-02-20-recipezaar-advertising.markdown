[MediaPost](http://www.mediapost.com/dtls_dsp_news.cfm?newsID=238867) did an article on political advertising on the web and explicitly calls out [Recipezaar](http://recipezaar.com) as a target for Dean's campaign dollars:

_The Dean for America campaign displayed a shift in strategy during the fourth quarter of last year. Compared to the previous quarter, when $67,300 went mainly toward ads on MSNBC, just $2,200 was earmarked for ads on Yahoo! GeoCities, VegSource, SoapZone, Recipezaar, The Christian Science Monitor, and Kaboose Network Kids Domain in the fourth quarter. The campaign boosted the bucks a bit in January when $6,000 bought placements on SoapZone and Recipezaar._
