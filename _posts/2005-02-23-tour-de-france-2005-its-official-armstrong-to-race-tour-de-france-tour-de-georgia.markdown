[Tour de France 2005: It's official: Armstrong to race Tour de France, Tour de Georgia](http://www.tdfblog.com/2005/02/its_official_ar.html). Good news, considering we will be vacationing in France with [my brother](http://www.hakalas.com/), his wife and his kids, so I can _finally_ see some stages of the Tour. I met Lance way back in 1994 at the beginning of Stage 2 of the (now defunct) Tour DuPont, which he won, maybe I can get his autograph this time. :)

Now we have to research the route and plan the stages we want to see.
