[David Pogue cribs Troy in this "Profit and Innovation at Microsoft" column](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/21/technology/circuits/21POGUE-EMAIL.html)

Why does Microsoft bother me so? Because in my view, its success relies primarily on this unique "you?re our customer whether you like it or not" arrangement. If Microsoft won through the superiority of its products or the brilliance of its new ideas, I wouldn?t resent its dominance one bit. (You go, Sony!)
