The electricians finished up the bulk of the work. They'll return for one day after the drywall is done and painted to put the jacks and plates on.

Tomorrow the drywall will go up, tape and mud applied the next day and probably Friday too. By the end of Monday, the windows should be framed. Then the walls can be primed and painted, which we will do ourselves to save about $1500 (!). Then, the floor and it's all done.
