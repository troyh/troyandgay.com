This FUD from Microsoft about Linux drives me nuts. They just say it, but never offer anything to back it up. What costs more? [IBM and Linux our biggest threats  - Microsoft](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26391.html).  ""Linux is free like a puppy. It looks free but when you get all the pieces around it, it doesn't work out so free. There's a lot more than I/O and memory management to make up an operating system."" [[The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk)]
