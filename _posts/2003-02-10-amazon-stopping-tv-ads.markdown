Telling for how bad TV ads are versus providing true value to customers, Amazon [will stop running ads on TV altogether](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/10/business/media/10ADCO.html) and will rely solely on word-of-mouth to drive sales:  _"Over the last couple of years, we have come to understand how low prices drive volume," said Mr. Bezos, a former Wall Street trader. "We think we get a better return giving the money to customers instead of television networks."_
