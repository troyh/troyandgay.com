Author of one of my favorite pop-psych books, [Stumbling on Happiness](http://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/gilbert/about.html), [Daniel Gilbert](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/science/study-in-science-shows-end-of-history-illusion.html?partner=rss&emc=rss): 


<blockquote>“Middle-aged people — like me — often look back on our teenage selves with some mixture of amusement and chagrin,” said one of the authors, Daniel T. Gilbert, a psychologist at Harvard. “What we never seem to realize is that our future selves will look back and think the very same thing about us. At every age we think we’re having the last laugh, and at every age we’re wrong.”</blockquote>
