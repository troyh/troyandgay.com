[Amazon gets approval to sell domain names](http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB1046476188963467263,00.html?mod=home%5Fwhats%5Fnews%5Fus) (WSJ).  What don't they sell?

They speculate that this will be a convenience to their Marketplace sellers (surprisingly "Third-party merchants were responsible for 21% of the items sold through the Amazon site in the fourth quarter") but me thinks Amazon might have something else up its sleeve...
