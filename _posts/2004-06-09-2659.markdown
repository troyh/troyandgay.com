TiVo is set to announce [a download service](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/09/technology/09net.html) so I can download movies directly to my TiVo. No more waiting weeks for the new movies to be available on DVD, I should be able to watch movies the night they're released on video. Bye bye Netflix.
