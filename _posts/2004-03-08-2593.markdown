Last October, I [posted](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/10/001753.php) about my frustrations with FedEx. That post is very high, currently 7th, in Google's results for ["fedex sucks"](http://www.google.com/search?q=fedex+sucks&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) so I get a lot of comments on it from other frustrated FedEx customers. But even more interesting is that several FedEx employees have posted explaining their side of the story. Very interesting.

And again, I say: I love the web!
