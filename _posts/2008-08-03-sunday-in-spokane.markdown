The Connolly's had a brunch on Sunday where Havana had one of her few exposures to a ton of kids:

She held onto her doll and seemed shocked by all the activity. Frankly, it was a bit too much for me as well. Note to self: stop short of 12 kids.

After brunch, we drove out to Grandma's farm where Havana met some animals:
