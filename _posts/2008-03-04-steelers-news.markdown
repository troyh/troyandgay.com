"Roethlisberger signed a $102 million 8-year contract":http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08063/862127-66.stm?cmpid=steelers.xml. He's the highest-paid Steeler ever and possibly the highest-paid player in the NFL. That's justified... he's been one of the top 3 QBs in all of his only 4 years in the NFL, including a Super Bowl win. I hope the Steelers can improve their offensive line this year to protect Roethlisberger better than they have the last couple years. But they made it harder by letting Alan Faneca go. "He signed with the New York Jets":http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08062/861895-66.stm?cmpid=steelers.xml becoming the highest-paid offensive lineman in NFL history with a $40 million 5-year contract.
