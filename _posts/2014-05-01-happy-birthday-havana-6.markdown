Havana turned 7 today. After swimming lessons, we went to Havana's favorite restaurant for birthday dinner: [Pagliacci's on Madison](http://www.pagliacci.com/locations/madison.html).  She says it's her favorite because "it has lots of windows" but I think it's because of the cool make-your-own-flavored-Cokes machine. 

Then we had cupcakes at home.

While leaving Pagliacci, we ran into Steve Wells, a guy we worked with at Microsoft who we haven't seen in 15 years. Small city.
