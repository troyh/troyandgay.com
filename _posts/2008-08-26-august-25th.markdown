I'm glad Hudson was born 5 minutes after midnight because August 25th is a much cooler date for birthdays than August 24th. Hudson shares a birthday with conductor Leonard Bernstein, movie director Tim Burton, Sean Connery, Elvis Costello, Frederick Forsyth, Rob Halford (singer for Judas Priest, a favorite band of mine as a kid), Monty Hall, football player Marvin Harrison, Stuart Murdoch (founder and singer of Belle & Sebastian, a favorite band of mine as an adult), Regis Philbin, Rachael Ray, Claudia Schiffer, Gene Simmons, fellow Seattleite Tom Skerritt, and Wilco singer Jeff Tweedy. Even a movie director with the same name and initials: "Hugh Hudson":http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0399853/.
