Obviously, Linux TCO is lower than Windows TCO (and ridiculously lower than Solaris TCO), at [40% of the cost](http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2002-10-08-019-26-NW-BZ-MR), but the interesting thing is that Windows admins can't run from machine to machine pointing & clicking as fast as Unix admins can ssh around the network: _The Windows technicians, however, only managed an average of 10 machines each, while Linux or Solaris admins can generally handle several times that._
