I had the [Ommegang Abbey Ale](http://www.ommegang.com/index.php?mcat=1&scat=2) that's been sitting in the fridge for a few weeks now. I like it. It's malty, very carbonated and, like the style, slightly fruity.

Ommegang brews Belgian-style beers and is located in Cooperstown, NY, of all places. The big Belgian brewer, Duvel, was an original investor but now owns them completely, I believe.
