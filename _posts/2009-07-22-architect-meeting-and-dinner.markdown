We went into Seattle today for a couple meetings, one with the architect at Miller-Hull, whose office I really like:

We're trying to figure out where the new house will sit on the property. The northern part of the property is not viable since the slope of the property is so great that the house would miss out on the view of Mt. Rainier and Puget Sound unless it was built 30 feet above the ground. We have a couple good ideas to locate it closer to where the current house is that still give us one big yard rather than a front and a backyard but we need to think about it a bit more. Otherwise, the property is fine for building just about anywhere, even over the current septic drain field.

Then we walked to [Collins Pub](http://www.thecollinspub.com/) for a lousy dinner but good beer: Grand Teton Double IPA, Anacortes IPA, Lagunitas Lil Sumpin' Sumpin' and Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale. To make up for the bad food, we went to Molly Moon's for ice cream.
