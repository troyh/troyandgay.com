I haven't been off the island in weeks, so I just got "Belle & Sebastian's":http://belleandsebastian.com "Books" CD last night. I can't stop listening to "Your Cover's Blown":

_Hey lady, put the phone down
Cancel all operations
Tell your friends to cool it
Cause your cover's blown
I want to see you alone
Cancel all operations
Tell your friends to cool it_

"Pitchfork Media":http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/wearetheworld/04-07-07.shtml calls it the "indie party hit of the summer". I agree... it was fun driving down California Avenue in West Seattle last night heading to dinner in the 80-degree weather with the windows open listening to this disco, bass-pumping song. :)  This band just gets better and better.
