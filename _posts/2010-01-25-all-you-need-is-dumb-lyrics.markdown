That -MasterCard- Blackberry commercial that runs every 10 minutes during football games contains these thought-provoking lyrics written by Paul McCartney:



<blockquote>There's nothing you can do that can't be done.
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung.
Nothing you can make that can't be made.</blockquote>



There's also no obvious statement that can't be obvious. Did I need another reason to lower my opinion of The Beatles?
