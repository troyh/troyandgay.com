The term "soap opera" came from Procter & Gamble's idea to create day-time television shows as vehicles to advertise cleaning products to women.

Also, the other day, I learned that Soft Cell's [Tainted Love](http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~harel/cgi/page/htmlit?Tainted_Love.html) is not an original song, it is a remake of [Gloria Jones](http://www.coversproject.com/artist/Gloria%20Jones)' _Tainted Love_.
