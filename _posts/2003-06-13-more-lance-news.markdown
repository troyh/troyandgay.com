Lance uncharacteristically [criticizes another cyclist](http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-armstrongrumsas&prov=reuters&type=lgns) (although he's probably right) and [maintained his lead](http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-dc&prov=reuters&type=lgns) in the Dauphiné-Libéré despite falling off his bike 9 miles into today's stage. It always amazes me when a cyclist can crash at 30-40MPH and then get back on the bike and finish racing.
