We saw [Real Women Have Curves](http://www.realwomenhavecurves.com/), a movie about an intelligent not-skinny Mexican teenage girl living in Los Angeles whose own mother repeatedly disparages her weight thinking it will prevent her from getting married. It's cute and simple and short, but it's undeveloped and unsurprising. It's more about a modern girl's ambitions versus her mother's older generation expectations for females.
