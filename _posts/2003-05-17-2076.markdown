![mcadoo.jpg](http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/mcadoo.jpg)Steve and his 2 dogs visited for the last time, at least for a while. He quit his job at [Real Networks](http://real.com) and is starting a new life in [Austin](http://www.austin-chamber.org/), Texas in June.

This morning, Ouzo and Steve's dog, Rose, got in a fight over breakfast. I stupidly fed our dogs without separating the other two dogs and Rose wanted to share Ouzo's food. Ouzo's usually so nice but he went nuts and attacked Rose. It was a struggle to pull them apart. Scary.
