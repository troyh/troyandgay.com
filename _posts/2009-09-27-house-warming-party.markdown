After going into Seattle this morning, we went in again this evening for Stephanie & Matt's house-warming party. I haven't gone into Seattle twice in the same day since the day we moved to Vashon and had to make a few trips back to the old house.

We were one of the first to get to the party and the first to leave at 11pm and raced to catch the 11:40 ferry. We barely made it but had we missed it we would have been taking the 1:50am ferry and would have gotten home at 2:30am. The ferries suck.
