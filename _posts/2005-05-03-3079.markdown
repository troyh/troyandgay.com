You think I'm scared of girls
Well maybe
But I'm not afraid of you
You want to scare me then you'll cling to me no matter what I do

_What Jail Is Like_
--Afghan Whigs

Listening to [KEXP](http://kexp.org), that oldie came on from one of my favorite bands, The Afghan Whigs. It brings back memories to when I used to blast _Gentlemen_ and _Black Love_ back in the early and mid-90s (when I was young and loved loud music). So I check out Greg Dulli's new band, [The Twilight Singers](http://www.thetwilightsingers.com/), and find they have a new album. There's something wrong with the industry when I don't even know about music that I'll definitely buy.
