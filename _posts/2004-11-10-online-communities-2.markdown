An eBay-sponsored "study":http://www.clickz.com/news/article.php/3432801 on online communities shows that people like them. That's not surprising since that's what the internet is about. And it also shows that the most popular communities are personal interest and hobby communities. Not surprising either, at least to us. What is interesting is that the communities where a huge percentage of investment is going related to online communities, dating services and business-networking services, are the least popular online communities.
