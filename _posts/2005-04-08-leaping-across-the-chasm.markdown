Geoffrey Moore, author of _Crossing The Chasm_, says [Linux, Apache and MySQL made the leap](http://news.com.com/2061-10795_3-5657784.html) across the chasm from early-adopters to mainstream users. He also said that [Firefox](http://getfirefox.com) hasn't yet crossed the chasm. On [Recipezaar](http://www.recipezaar.com), Firefox already has 7.8% of the market, just 2.2% short of their 2005 goal of 10%.
