We've made some pretty significant enhancements to the [MyWireService beta](http://www.mywireservice.com).  We now support creating your new newspaper sections, saved clippings are more accessible, and we've made it easier to get to past news, and a lot more, including working around a dumb CSS redraw bug in IE that made it almost impossible to read your news.  Did I mention that we added The Globe & Mail for Bergy and we're still looking for more Canadian news sources? ;-)  We actually feel good enough to start telling people about it.  So if you have a news junkie or weblogging friend, tell them about it.
