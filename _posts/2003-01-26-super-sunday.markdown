The Super Bowl is today. Adam Blum, of all people, is coming over with this 2 kids. I haven't seen him in 5 years or so. Biff may come over. Gary Sipple is coming over too (Nancy is out of town in Oregon).





**Update:** Game was boring, Tampa Bay blew the Raiders out. Adam and his daughter, Liz, came out and Gary came over. Biff opted out as Renuka had to write a paper or something. We had beers, wine, chips, a great 7-layer dip, wings and ribs for dinner.





Gary showed me how to chop wood so I can finish the tree in the backyard! Adam & Liz had to go after the game but Gary stayed and had ribs with us.
