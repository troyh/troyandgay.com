You know what is scary about America? Not McDonald's. Not Budweiser. Not that [so few Americans have passports](http://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2003/01/31/how_many_america.php) or venture outside the US borders. Not even that Americans watch Bill O'Reilly, [a raving idiot who distorts facts and spouts outright lies](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/002046.shtml). What's scary is that Americans believe morons like Bill O'Reilly. People believe what they want to believe, the facts are nuisances.
