Gay ran off to Seattle to see friends tonight. I stayed home working. Had a couple [Fuller's](http://www.fullers.co.uk/) beers (an 1845 and an ESB) and worked all night listening to [Radiohead](http://www.radiohead.com/), [Roxy Music](http://www.roxymusic.co.uk/) and [Arab Strap](http://www.arabstrap.co.uk/).
