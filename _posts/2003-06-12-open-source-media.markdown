[Tony Perkins](http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=534_0_2_0_C): _Now we have the opportunity to do "open source media" for the benefit of all. I think successful media brands will have an increasing share of their content generated directly by their audience._

In the cooking arena, we're so far ahead of the game already with [Recipezaar](http://recipezaar.com) and just getting to start some interesting new stuff. It's gonna be a fun next few years. :-)
