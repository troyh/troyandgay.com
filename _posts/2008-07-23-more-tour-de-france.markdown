I must have misheard Phil Liggett [yesterday](http://troyh.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/p_2048_1536_ef28b242-2aed-4481-b2ea-6a8b3646d5c1.jpeg2008/07/22/watching-the-tour-de-france/) because today's stage is much harder: three HC climbs including Col du Galibier, 131 miles and a finish on the famous L'Alpe d'Huez.

The best-placed American is Vandevelde but he lost time yesterday and is 3:15 back. Unless he does well today, I think Schleck, Sastre or Cadel Evans will be the winner in Paris. Schleck's got the strongest team so it'll be hard to beat him today.

Sastre attacked on Alpe d'Huez. Helped by his teammates, the Schleck brothers, he beat the other contenders by over 2 minutes. It looks like it'll come down to Saturday's time trial between him and Cadel Evans. Vandevelde didn't do anything to help his cause.
