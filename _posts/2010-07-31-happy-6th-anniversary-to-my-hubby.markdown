![When we started 12 years ago](http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/gay-going-home.jpg?w=300)The Troy and Gay for which this site is named have officially been married for six years today.  The picture at the left is from when we first started dating twelve years ago.  Starting tomorrow we will be married for more days than we haven't, so it is a tipping point for us.



Troy,

Thanks for giving me the best years of my life so far.  Each day is better than the <del>next</del> last. ;)

xoxo,

Gay
