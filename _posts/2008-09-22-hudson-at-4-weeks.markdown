He's four weeks old now. So far, he's been a great baby, much easier to take care of than Havana was. From what we understood, Havana was a very good baby so I was not expecting to be so lucky the second time. And with a 16 month-old and a newborn, we expected to have our hands full and to be hating it at this point.

But that's not the case at all. Gay has to wake up every hour or two at night to feed him, of course, and some nights are better than others. Generally though, he's very quiet and keeps to himself. I can even bottle-feed him already. I think that makes Gay happy. Havana let me do that maybe twice in total, but I've fed him twice in just the last few days. I can even get him to calm down and sleep my arms in minutes.

The next few weeks should be interesting to see if this streak of good fortune continues. The way it's going, though, I'm hoping he'll be sleeping through the night by the time he's 4 months old.
