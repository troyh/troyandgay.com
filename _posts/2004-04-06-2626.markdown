An interesting [article](http://news.com.com/2010-7352_3-5185413.html?part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news) about the importance of IP (Internet Protocol, not Intellectual Property). The world will indeed be great as long as competition exists. Unfortunately, over the last few years, the US Govt has consistently sided with big corps over small corps and the FCC seems to be willing to let any two large corps merge into a mammoth corp. If the government doesn't figure this out and quick, we'll be paying exorbitant rates  to monolithic corporations and it'll take several decades to correct itself.
