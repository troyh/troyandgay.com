Kelly Electric came out and finished up running ethernet through the house. We now have an ethernet jack in the office and ethernet running into the crawl space, where it is running up to the stereo closet so our 802.11b access point can be centrally-located. Eventually, we'll put a machine in there connected to an input of the stereo to stream MP3s throughout the house stereo.
