[Orrin Hatch wants to destroy your computer](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2999780.stm) remotely if you "violate" a copyright. This is what it looks like when a politician has been in office too long.

Ironically, Hatch himself [appears to be guilty of a copyright violation](http://amish.blogmosis.com/archives/012511.html#012511) on his web site.
