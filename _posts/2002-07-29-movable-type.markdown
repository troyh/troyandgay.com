Switched from [Radio](http://radio.userland.com) to [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org) for our weblog. MT is much better: runs on the server, stores data in MySQL, supports multiple users and multiple weblogs, is open-source (written in perl), is free (but $150 for commercial use) and is more flexible template-wise. Plus, it was written by a husband-and-wife team. :)

You can see our MovableType installation [here](http://fumweb/MT/mt.cgi).
