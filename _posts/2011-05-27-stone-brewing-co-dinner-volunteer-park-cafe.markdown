While Gay went to Costco to buy [the hot tub](http://troyandgay.com/2011/05/26/hot-tub-and-house-update/), I stayed at the house to start installing the ladder rack in the basement. Jon and Megan came over at 6 to see the house and Gay got back soon after. We gave them a tour of the house and then went to Volunteer Park Cafe for the [Stone Brewing Co.](http://www.stonebrew.com/) beer dinner, an event I have been looking forward to since we had to cancel our reservation for last year's event. Dinner was excellent but the beers were mostly standard Stone beers (Levitation Ale, Pale Ale, IPA) and the only Stone beer I hadn't had before was their Highway 78 Scotch Ale, which unfortunately, is not available in Washington State -- I really liked that . Their Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale was the stand-out for me, certainly the best Black IPA/Cascadian Dark Ale I've had since it's a style I'm not fond of.
