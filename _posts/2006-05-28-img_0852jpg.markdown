I kegged my beer last weekend and it's carbonated, cold and drinkable now. It's an IPA and the second time I brewed this one this year because it's so good. It's nicely hoppy in both aroma and a lasting aftertaste.

Here's the recipe:

6.6 Lbs  Coopers Light Malt
1 Lbs Coopers Light Dry Malt
8 oz Crystal 40L
8 oz Cara-Pils
1/2 oz Galena hops @boil
1 oz Columbus hops @ 40 minutes
2 oz Cascade hops @ 55 minutes
White Labs California Ale Yeast

For Christmas 2003 Gay got me a beer tap setup. It's almost dangerous to have a beer tap in your house.
