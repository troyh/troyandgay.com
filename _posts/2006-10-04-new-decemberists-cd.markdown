The [Decemberists](http://decemberists.com/)' new album, _The Crane Wife_, is out. I wasn't even expecting a new album, even _after_ I bought the single on iTunes last week. It's not quite the same as previous albums, it's more 70s rock than the kinda folky-shanty that I thought they sounded like on older albums. I swear The Island has a little classic rock (Deep Purple?) keyboard in it, very weird.

For crying out loud, they have [a MySpace page](http://www.myspace.com/thedecemberists). Isn't MySpace uncool yet? Wait til the kids find out that the eXtreme-unhip Rupert Murdoch owns it.
