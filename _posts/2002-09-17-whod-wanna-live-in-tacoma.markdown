The [USATODAY.com:](http://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/housing/2002-09-16-overpriced-markets_x.htm) Tacoma tops the list of Michael Sklarz at Fidelity National Information Solutions. His latest analysis identifies it as the nation's most overpriced housing market: Prices are 23% over what Sklarz calls the intrinsic value for homes there, vs. 7.2% overpricing for homes nationwide.
