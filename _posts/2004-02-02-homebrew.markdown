I finally kegged my first batch of homebrew (technically, not my first, but it's been years since I brewed). I "force-carbonated" it by shaking the begeezus out of it after attaching the CO2 to it. An hour later and I could pour a glass of beer. Just in time for the Super Bowl too. Beer's extra good when you made it yourself!

The next project is to put a fridge under the counter and install the taps on top of the counter. I'll never have to leave the house pretty soon!
