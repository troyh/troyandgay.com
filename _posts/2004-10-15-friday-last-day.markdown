Today's the last day of our honeymoon. We're going to see about shipping stuff home, have a massage (my first ever!) and then have a "romantic dinner for two" (hotel's words) on the beach tonight for the last dinner of our vacation. Then all day traveling tomorrow and, hopefully, be back at home late Saturday night. :)
