The carpet and the vinyl flooring has been pulled up, the drywall and insulation was removed from the exterior wall, the roof was supported with a brace and today the holes for the windows were cut. The spaces for the windows are surprisingly big, it was shocking to walk into the room for the first time.

Tomorrow the windows should go in and the electrician is coming on Monday to do all the electrical work. We still need to pick out the flooring. Right now, we're planning to go with a dark brown bamboo flooring. Bamboo is extremely durable and eco-friendly since bamboo is essentially a weed, so there's no shortage of it.
