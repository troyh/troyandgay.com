David Pogue from the NY Times has written "an article":http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/24/apples-mobilemess/ on the MobileMe outage, criticizing Apple's pathetic handling of it:

But the real problem is how Apple is responding. For a company that's so brilliant at marketing, it seems to have absolutely no clue about crisis management.

One of my correspondents put it like this: "I love Apple. My first computer ever was a 128K Macintosh. But the lack of explanation and communication on the MobileMe problem is outrageous. Why not update the status message? Why not give us some indication of what's going on?"

I called Apple. Would the P.R. team be willing to say what the problem is? What is being done to solve it? When might it be fixed? What kind of resources or time is being spent on a resolution?

No. Apple declined to comment on any of that.

...

That's about as far as Apple will go in expressing an understanding of the emotional toll the outage is causing those 20,000 people.

It's amazing that Apple doesn't recognize this situation. This is an airplane that's stuck on the runway for hours with no food or working bathroom. And the pilot doesn't come on the P.A. system to tell the customers what the problem is, what's being done to fix it, how much longer they might be stuck, and how he empathizes with their plight. Instead, he comes on once every three hours to repeat the same thing: "We apologize for the inconvenience."

MobileMess, indeed.
