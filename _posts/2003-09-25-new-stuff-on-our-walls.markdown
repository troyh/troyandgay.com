...but I am still slapping myself because there was a [Mark Tobey](http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_bio_153B.html) pencil drawing that went for just $750 (1/10 its value) at the Vashon Arts Auction -- it wasn't in the preview, so I didn't know about it when it came up for auction, and I just couldn't believe it was the same *Mark Tobey*...and the art was on the other side of the room at the time...  arg!  I remember seeing a Mark Tobey exhibit in high school at (one of the few cultural places in Spokane at the time) the [Cheney Cowles Museum](http://www.northwestmuseum.org/)
