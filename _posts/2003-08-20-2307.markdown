My dad had a CAT scan and an MRI a couple weeks ago and today confirmed that he has [hydrocephalus](http://www.hydroassoc.org/). He is scheduled to have an operation on September 11 to install a [shunt](http://www.hydroassoc.org/newsletter/shunt.html) in his skull to relieve the pressure on his brain.
