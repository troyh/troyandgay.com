Today's my 40th birthday. The government gave me a free hour and the NFL gave the Steelers the day off so they could celebrate my birthday too.

I had The Reverend Belgian Quadrupel Ale (to celebrate my 4 decades) from [Avery](http://www.averybrewing.com/) while watching football and barbecuing the steaks. With dinner, we opened a bottle of [K Vintners](http://www.kvintners.com/) El Jefe that we bought two years ago on a visit to Walla Walla.
