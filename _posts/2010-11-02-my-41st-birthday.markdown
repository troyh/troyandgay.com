As of today, I've made 41 trips around the sun. I hope I get a lot more. Gay made me birthday dinner, as usual, and got a ton of nice beers for me to pick from while she cooked. Knowing I'd have wine with dinner, I took it easy and had Sierra Nevada's 2010 Celebration Ale, one of my favorite winter beers.

Summary of my 41st year:

<!-- more -->

Just a few days before my 40th last year, my dad had a sudden visit to the hospital and they found he had cancer in his kidney. [He had it removed](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/11/22/my-dad-is-cancer-free/) and is cancer-free.

[We went to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/12/06/seattle-to-cabo/) for a winter vacation.

We were working with Tom Kundig on designing a new house on Vashon and were getting cold feet about staying on Vashon, so we took three trips, in [January](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/01/15/san-francisco-2/), February (with Havana) and in March with both kids via [Tahoe](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/03/21/tahoe/), to San Francisco to see about real estate there.

Havana had [her first ski lesson](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/03/25/havanas-first-ski-lesson/) while in Tahoe.

Hudson had his first (and hopefully last) [stitches](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/03/11/hudsons-first-stitches/) after mysteriously falling on something (we still don't know).

We celebrated [Havana's 3rd birthday](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/04/30/happy-birthday-havana-3/).

We decided to not build the house on Vashon and [to buy a house in Seattle](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/06/01/moving-back-to-seattle/) instead. We finallyÂ [bought a house in Seattle](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/06/16/bought-a-house-in-seattle/) in June and closed on it July 19. It's been under renovation ever since.

Gay and I celebrated [our 6th wedding anniversary](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/07/31/6th-wedding-anniversary/).

Hudson [turned 2](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/08/25/happy-birthday-hudson-2/).

[Baby #3](http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/08/04/baby-3-20-week-ultrasound/) was conceived and is mostly done.
