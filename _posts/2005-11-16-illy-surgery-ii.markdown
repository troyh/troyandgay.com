![](/pix//wed3.jpg)Illy is having her second [TPLO surgery](http://www.vetsurgerycentral.com/tplo.htm) to repair her right knee (a torn cruciate ligament) today.  It is a fascinating procedure, because they actually cut a significant piece out of the tibia bone and reattach it in order to level the place where her femur rests on it, rendering the ligament unneeded.  We should hear soon about how the surgery goes, and will be able to pick her up tomorrow.  Can't stop thinking about her right now though....
**Update 7:27p:** She's out of surgery and recovering now.  Everything went well.
