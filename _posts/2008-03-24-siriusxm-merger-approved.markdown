The DoJ "approved":http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSWAT00918420080324 the Sirius/XM merger! It's about "time":http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/02/20/siriusxm-merger/! Since we have both Sirius and XM, I can't wait to see how this affects the service. If nothing else, I hope Sirius' reception is as good as XM.
