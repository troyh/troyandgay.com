The Betty MacDonald Farm, recently profiled in this Seattle Times story, is our neighbor (that gravel lane mentioned is the shared unincorporated road to our house too) and the proprietor, Judith, gave us a lovely Christmas wreath the other day that she made from boxwood.   (Too bad they don't have any of the accompanying photos from the print story online.  I didn't see them and heard they were great.)  Glad Judith got some good press!  It was one of the fir trees Judith planted 10 years ago that is now our Christmas tree -- how country is that, to have a neighbor who sells Christmas trees you can cut fresh and walk home with.  We've said it before, but it sure is nice to have such good neighbors and friends.

Tomorrow Troy and I are hosting our annual Neighborhood Cookie Exchange Party.  I love it here.
