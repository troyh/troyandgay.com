We had a meeting in downtown Seattle this afternoon and after that we went to Tom Douglas' neighborhood for a cocktail at [Dahlia Lounge](http://www.tomdouglas.com/restaurants/dahlia-lounge) and then next door to [Serious Pie](http://www.tomdouglas.com/restaurants/serious-pie) for dinner. Gay has been there a couple times but it was my first time. We shared the cherry bomb peppers, sweet fennel sausage pizza and the guanciale, soft egg, arugula pizza. Both were fantastic and an egg, which I've never had before, was surprisingly good on a pizza.

See Tom Douglas, the owner and famous Seattle restaurateur, [talk about the place](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ngxpwrnt7bM).
