![IMG_2471.jpg](http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2471.jpg) Kathy arrived yesterday to spend the week with us and to help us test and fine-tune a big new feature we've been working on for the site.

After picking her up at the airport, we went to [Salumi](http://www.salumicuredmeats.com/) (the owner's son is [Mario Batali](http://www.babbonyc.com/mariob2.html)) in Seattle to get some meats, then to [Pike Place Market](http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/) for more grocery shopping, [Three Dog Bakery](http://www.threedog.com/) for treats for the dogs, then to [Ray's Boathouse](http://www.rays.com/) for dinner.
