Mayor Nagin [says the body count for Katrina may exceed 10,000!](http://www.nola.com/newslogs/tporleans/index.ssf?/mtlogs/nola_tporleans/archives/2005_09.html#077206). Previous to Katrina, the worst hurricane to hit the US was in [Galveston, Texas in 1900](http://www.ezl.com/~fireball/Disaster16.htm). It killed over 6,000 people. If Nagin's 10,000 figure is accurate, Katrina is the worst natural disaster in the US in over a century by a _long_ margin. The Red Cross has already said [it's the worst disaster in their 120-year history](http://www.clarionledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050901/NEWS0110/50901037/1260).

If you gave money for smaller disasters, [giving](http://redcross.org) for this one is a no-brainer. :)
