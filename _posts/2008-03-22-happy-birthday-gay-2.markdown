Today is Gay's birthday. We're going out to dinner tonight (without Havana) in the big city.

**Update:** We were reminded of why the "Washington State Ferry System sucks":http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/06/washington-state-ferry-system-sucks/. We waited in the ferry line for an hour because the boats were running late, we missed the first ferry and the next ferry was 20 minutes away (at best). We wouldn't make it to the restaurant until almost 8pm and we'd have to rush through dinner to catch the 10:15pm ferry or risk hitting the 11:40pm ferry. So we decided to have dinner on the island and go into Seattle sometime this week to make it up. This way, Gay gets two birthday dinners. :)
