Watching [The Office](http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/theoffice/), there's a great bit when the IT guy comes to install software on a computer. When he's done, he tells the computer's user:

"I'm now going to restart the computer. When it starts again, it will ask you a question with three options: Yes, No and Cancel. Press Cancel, do not press Yes or No."

Have you ever been asked a question like that? Yes, No, Cancel.
