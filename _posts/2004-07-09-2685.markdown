[Scott Rosenberg](http://blogs.salon.com/0000014/2004/07/09.html#a639): _What I've never understood, and still don't understand, is why the rest of the U.S. government, and to some extent the U.S. media, have not furiously and persistently asked the obvious, and still hanging, question: Why didn't we go full-tilt after bin Laden in spring of 2002?_

One day we'll find out the answer to that question and I doubt anyone will like the answer. Hopefully, it won't take another 3,000+ dead innocent Americans to get that question asked of our government.
