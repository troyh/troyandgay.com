TiVo [announced quarterly earnings](http://biz.yahoo.com/rc/030306/tech_tivo_earns_1.html) today. They're still  losing money ($21 million for the year) but they're growing and now have 624,000 subscribers. I believe their goal is 1 million by the end of the year. I can't wait til they ship the [Home Media Option](http://tivo.com/4.9.asp) so I can view my [iPhoto](http://apple.com/iphoto/) pics and listen to my [iTunes](http://apple.com/itunes/) music through TiVo.

And I wish they'd start competing with Netflix. They now have the tools to deliver almost-on-demand movies. I'd pay for that!
