Kelly told us this morning that she just heard that a friend of hers was killed in Afghanistan this weekend. We realized she was talking about Robert Bennedsen, the model in "this blog post":http://troyandgay.com/blog/2005/07/01/3099/, and the son of our friends Scott and Tracy. Tracy did flowers for our wedding and Scott cooked the pig for the wedding feast.

He was just 25 years old. We only met him a couple times at their July 4th parties. He was a good smart kid and had far too short a life.

Our condolences to Scott & Tracy.
