[Bruce Perens' Open Source Series](http://perens.com/Books/) from Prentice Hall that you can copy and even sell (!): _ How do we make money? People like paper. We put the paper versions in stores several months before the electronic versions come out. Since the retail channel is filled as soon as the paper versions come out, it removes most of the incentive that a second publisher would have to reprint the books while they are new._
