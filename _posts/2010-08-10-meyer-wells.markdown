Great "article on Meyer-Wells":http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/business/energy-environment/08sustain.html?_r=3 in the NY Times on Saturday. 4 or 5 years ago, they did two fireplace mantles, the casework for our bookshelf in our bedroom and a really cool side table that we put our drinks on every night. Glad to see their business is doing well. We're talking to them about making something out of the Monkey Puzzle Trees we're going to take down. They've never worked with wood from a Monkey Puzzle Tree so they're excited about it. I hope we can turn those hideous things into something beautiful.
