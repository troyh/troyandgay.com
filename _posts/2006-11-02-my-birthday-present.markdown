Gay got me a [Fuller's ESB](http://www.fullers-ales.com/esb.php) tap handle from eBay. I couldn't believe it when I saw it. I bet there's not more than 100 people in the US who have one of these at home. If only the beer that came out of the tap was Fuller's. :)

For those of you who haven't heard me rattle on about how perfect this beer is, it's my favorite beer, the beer I'd choose if I could only have one beer the rest of my life. And I was fortunate enough to have a keg of it served at our wedding. I even convinced a Vashon restaurant to serve it when they first opened (but they've since stopped since I didn't drink enough of it to justify the cost, apparently).
