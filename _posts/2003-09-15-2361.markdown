Now that [we're engaged](/archives/2003/09/001696.php#001696), the planning begins: a date, catering, invitations, etc. It'll be sometime next summer and we will probably have it at our house. Other than that, nothing yet. But we've already found [a Seattle printer](http://citizenrob.blogspot.com/) who won't be printing our invitations.
