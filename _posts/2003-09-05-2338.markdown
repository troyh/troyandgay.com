After a recommendation from [a Recipezaar user](http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=32724), who we met and had dinner with months ago, we finally saw [Rabbit-Proof Fence](http://www.rabbitprooffence.com.au/). It's a good movie about 3 Australian Aboriginal kids who were taken away from their mother because they were a product of race-mixing and escaped and walked back home avoiding the police.
