Last night we had dinner at [Zoë](http://seattle.citysearch.com/profile/11349390/), which is one of our favorite restaurants with my friend [Adam](http://www.talaris.com/html/company/management_team.html#Blum) and his new fiancé Lauren (and they paid!). The food was good still, but the portions have gotten smaller. Small as in what Lauren's diamond ring is not... [4 carats](http://www.bluenile.com/diamonds_details.asp?pid=LD00505936&item=0_4&filter_id=1&sec=&designer=ring&query=&page=1&sortby=ranking)! It's like wearing a ping pong ball. I think his son can just chip off a piece of it when he proposes to someone. (Gay, you are not getting a $66,000 ring.... _ever_).

We planned today's [Urban Challenge](http://www.urbanchallenge.com/seattle/) that they participated in. They finished 36th out of 100 in three-and-a-half hours, 1.5 hours behind the winners. We were their [Google](http://google.com)rs so we had to figure out the answers to the clues and guide them around the city. We got all the questions right, except for the one that Adam misread. And navigating them around the streets was tough, especially since they weren't very familiar with Seattle.
