We were invited by our friends at Wells Fargo to "Wells Fargo Day" at "Qwest field":http://www.seahawks.com/stadium.aspx?SecID=31 to see the "Seahawks":http://www.seahawks.com/default.aspx?SecID=3 game. We got to sit in the Wells Fargo clubhouse, which means free beer & wine, a heated room with movie-theater seating. The stadium is new and much much much better than the old "Kingdome":http://www.metrokc.gov/stadium/ it replaced. The Seahawks ended a three-game losing streak by beating the Panthers, 23-17.
