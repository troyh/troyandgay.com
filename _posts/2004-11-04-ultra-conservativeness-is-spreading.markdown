According to this graphic, which colors the state in shades of blue and red based on the percentage of Democrat and Republican votes in each state, shows that the US is less red than the electoral map indicates. That's encouraging, in fact, the country appears to be very moderate to left-leaning. Very interesting. "This graphic":http://s-train.kaphmedia.net/archives/blog-misc/2004countymap2.gif, which shows the breakdown at the precinct-level, i.e., all-or-nothing counting the way the electoral college works.
