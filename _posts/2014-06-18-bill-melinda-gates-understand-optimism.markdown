From [their commencement speech at Stanford](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/june/gates-commencement-remarks-061514.html), which is all about innovation, empathy and optimism:



<blockquote>Optimism for me isn't a passive expectation that things will get better; it's a conviction that we can make things better â€“ that whatever suffering we see, no matter how bad it is, we can help people if we don't lose hope and we don't look away.</blockquote>



Optimism is a reason to do something. Pessimism is an excuse to do nothing.
