Had good friends John and Deborah Bender over for dinner and drinks -- I should probably say 'drinks with a little dinner'.  Had [Blue Cheese Beef Tenderloin](http://www.recipezaar.com/18487) (but with a rib-eye roast instead), [Leek Risotto](http://www.recipezaar.com/49559), a salad and [Chocolate Fudge Brownies](http://www.recipezaar.com/50264) with ice cream.  Boys enjoyed a narrow lead over the girls in 20th Century Trivial Pursuit before we had to call it quits.
