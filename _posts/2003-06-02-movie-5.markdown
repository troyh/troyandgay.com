Saw Clint Eastwood's [Blood Work](http://bloodworkmovie.warnerbros.com/home.html) last night with Gay's dad and aunts. It was good, not great. It was a straightforward detective story with a slightly different plot. But it was entertaining and Clint Eastwood is as good as usual. There were some annoying actors, like the comedian/actor Paul Rodriguez and Wanda de Jesus was too melodramatic. [Jeff Daniels](http://www.imdb.com/Name?Daniels,+Jeff) was good, though. I'll always remember Jeff Daniels from [Something Wild](http://www.imdb.com/Title?0091983) that I liked as a teenager.
