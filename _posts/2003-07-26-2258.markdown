After today's time trial, Lance is set to win his 5th straight Tour de France becoming only the second person ever to win 5 straight. And he [promises to try for a 6th](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/cycling/tour_de_france_2003/3099759.stm), something nobody has ever done. He mentioned in a post-race interview that there's some things people don't know about this Tour, and he suggested that the team was sabatoged. When he was pulled off his bike by a fan, I wondered if it wasn't intentional and the replays sure seemed suspicious to me. But he won and realizes that he needs to improve for next year. And Ullrich is going to come back with a much better team I'm sure.

And Tyler Hamilton, riding with a broken collarbone, jumped ahead 2 places in today's time trial to take 4th overall, ahead of the undeserving and poor sportsman, Iban Mayo. I like that too.
