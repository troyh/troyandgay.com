The "Dry Fly Distillery":http://dryflydistilling.com/ is the only distillery in Washington State. They've been in business a year and we visited and got a tour from the co-owner. They make vodka and gin right now and will be coming out with a whiskey later this year and a bourbon next year. Most gins are made with juniper berries and maybe one more ingredient, they put several spices in their gin, including hops. Everything they use is grown in Washington State.

I even got to bottle some gin and put the labels on it:

Because I did such a great job bottling, they gave me a free t-shirt. We bought a bottle of gin and vodka and will try a martini as soon as we get home.
