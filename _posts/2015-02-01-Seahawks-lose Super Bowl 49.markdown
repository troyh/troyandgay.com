The Seahawks lost a game they should have won. It was a depressing end to a great season.

I love that I can care so much about something that I know doesn't really matter. That's a great thing about sports. The Seahawks lost the Super Bowl in a painful way and it feels like a horrible thing for a while, but it feels great at the same time realizing that *real* life goes on unaffected... I have my health and happiness, my wife and kids are great, happy and healthy too.
