Every couple of weeks someone else realizes that they have become [addicted to Recipezaar](http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=29600).  Not only do folks really get off on our caring community, but they really are cooking better, more, trying new things.  I get so touched when I hear them repeat our motto too "you make Recipezaar a bigger and better place."

And if that wasn't all this weekend is the [Dana-athon](http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=29513).  Dana is one of our members who is battling brain cancer, and folks around the world are cooking her recipes this weekend as a way to send her good energy.  What a neat idea.  UPDATE: 164 people participated!  I doubt I could get 164 people to cook for me...
