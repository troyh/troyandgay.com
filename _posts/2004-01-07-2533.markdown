Nothing to do but read news while the power is out and my laptop battery still has power, and I find that [Joe Gibbs is returning to coach the Redskins](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/nm/nfl_gibbs_dc) -- I care because I grew up (and I use the term "grew up" loosely) in the Washington DC area. Has there ever been another coach who coached after being inducted into the Hall of Fame?
