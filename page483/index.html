<p>Can you believe it is over bar code scanners?  They want to improve the paper process by using scanners and the Union laborers who are paid $85k/year at the LOW level are pissed because they bar code contract will probably employ their own non-union laborers.  Frankly, they port owners are right to lock out over a slow down, but perhaps they should just fire the union over it.</p>

<p>Good WSJ article summarizes which types of funds are losing how much money for the year.  Everyone is exiting and mutual funds have lost 1/2 of their assets in the past year from losses and sellers.</p>

            <p>After meeting the lawyer, we went to Costco. We got The Godfather set on DVD, among the usuals. Then we went to dinner with Megan at (what was called Bangkok House but is now) Tropics, a Thai restaurant in the ID.</p>

            <p>Went into Seattle to meet with John Bender at Holland &amp; Knight. John has much better credentials than Jeff Thomas and was recommended by two other well-regarded lawyers (Chris Wells and Frank Huebner). It went very well; John is very experienced and smart, plus his assistant, David Ebel, is also smart.</p>

<p>Now, how do I tell Jeff Thomas we wonâ€™t be needing his services?</p>
