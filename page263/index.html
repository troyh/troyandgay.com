          <p>We just made some significant changes to “Recipezaar”:http://recipezaar.com and we’ve run into some amazing IE6 bugs. There’s at least 3 bugs in the way it handles cookies, most notably it doesn’t even properly understand the timezone it’s in so people on the east coast think any cookie that expires within 3 hours of our time is in the past (and IE always thinks it’s in the timezone it was installed in). Then there’s the “SSLv3 bug”:http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;%5bLN%5d;305217. Amazing that this browser can be so popular yet so broken. And I’m not even talking about how bad it is at CSS!</p>

          <p>“DOS almost killed the Mars rover”:http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1638764,00.asp. Your tax dollars <em>not</em> at work. Microsoft can’t make email reliable on Earth, why is NASA trusting their products on spacecraft?!</p>

          <p>We watched “Love Actually”:http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/love_actually/ last night. <em>Stupid Actually</em>. This movie was so bad in so many ways it’s pointless to even talk about it. And both Siskel Ebert and Roeper liked it. I may have to stop respecting their opinions. Almost every relationship featured a man and his female employee, except for the 6 year-old kid and his classmate (seriously). This wasn’t about love, it’s about sexual harassment in the workplace. I mean, this movie was just embarrassingly bad. Hugh Grant played the Prime Minister of England. ‘nuff said. Crikey!</p>

          <p>What I learned today listening to NPR:  The average family would save $1,000 per year by owning a Prius hybrid car.  Ford is developing a hybrid SUV.  Seattle is the worst city for driving and getting lost – despite living here for more than seven years, my husband proves this fact.  Wait, does that make it the “best” city for driving and getting lost?</p>

          <p>Last night, we went to the “charity auction”:http://www.vashonisland.net/rotary/ that we “helped out initially”:http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2625 on. It was held at “Misty Isle Farms”:http://www.mistyislefarms.com/, the home of Tom Stewart, a local Vashon celebrity. That alone was a treat for us, never having been there. He lives on beautiful grounds, immaculately landscaped complete with a waterfall and a rose garden.</p>

<p>It was raining like crazy (Seattle has had an unusually wet summer) and it was outside, but it was covered by a huge tent. The food was prepared by the same people who did our wedding Rehearsal Dinner a few weeks ago, so that was good. The event was a wine festival so there was plenty of wine and cheese to taste, and that we did.</p>

<p>Most of the auction items were expensive bottles of wine and we were outbid on a few bottles of wine by people at our own table, apparently wine connoisseurs. But we did end up with a bottle of 1984 “Stags Leap”:http://www.stagsleapwinery.com/ Cabernet Sauvignon. I think we overpaid, but hey, it’s for charity. :)  Gay also bought three of the table centerpieces, large glass vases.</p>

<p>After the auction, we went to our friends’ house for some (more) wine, to play with their new puppy and we watched “Fargo”:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116282/. Great movie.</p>
