  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Contador took the race lead today after attacking race-leader Andy Schleck after he had a mechanical problem. I’m no fan of crybaby Contador and I hate to see him win the Tour that way, but it’s part of the sport.</p>

<p>When interviewed about it, he shouldn’t have lied and said he didn’t know he had a problem – the guy was standing still when he rode around him. How could he have not known?!? At least he was booed when he took the podium to put on the yellow jersey. I’ve never seen/heard that before.</p>

<p>Maybe Contador will have a mechanical and lose the race this week. He’ll whine that it’s unfair when it happens to him, I’m sure. That’d be fun to see.</p>

<p>Cervelo team owner Gerard Vroomen <a href="http://velonews.competitor.com/2010/07/news/lance-armstrong-other-tour-riders-react-to-port-de-bales-chain-debate_129995">got it right</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Contador just gained a great chance to win, but he lost the chance to win greatly.</blockquote>
