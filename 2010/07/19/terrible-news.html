  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Kelly told us this morning that she just heard that a friend of hers was killed in Afghanistan this weekend. We realized she was talking about Robert Bennedsen, the model in “this blog post”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2005/07/01/3099/, and the son of our friends Scott and Tracy. Tracy did flowers for our wedding and Scott cooked the pig for the wedding feast.</p>

<p>He was just 25 years old. We only met him a couple times at their July 4th parties. He was a good smart kid and had far too short a life.</p>

<p>Our condolences to Scott &amp; Tracy.</p>
