    <p>We were supposed to close yesterday, but the insurance, of all things, took forever and ended up being a few hours late so closing was postponed a day. This morning, we took the 10:30a ferry into Seattle to Chicago Title Co in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Center">Columbia Tower</a> for 30 minutes of signing papers.</p>

<p>Then we went to a celebratory lunch in our new neighborhood at <a href="http://www.vioscafe.com/vioscapitolhill.html">Cafe Vios</a> – a good Greek casual kid-friendly (a kids playroom inside) restaurant just a few minutes’ walk from home. I likes. One of my complaints about Seattle has always been the lack of good Greek places, but maybe that’s not true anymore with Vios.</p>

<p>On the way home, we stopped at <a href="http://www.utrechtart.com/">Utrecht</a> for some drafting supplies (tracing paper, a new scale, pencils, etc.) so we can keep playing architects for the remodel.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> We officially closed at 4pm. Conveniently, today is Friday so we celebrated with our usual Friday Manhattans.</p>
