    <p>We’re giving most of the plumbing and electrical fixtures and some other things to <a href="http://www.seconduse.com/">Second Use</a> and they’re picking it all up tomorrow. This is handy because they do all the removal so we don’t have to pay the labor to have it removed and they pay us a portion of the fair market value for the stuff (and then they re-sell it).</p>

<p>Kelly and Stuart are building a house right now so we offered the stuff to her too and she wanted a few items. So we met her, Stuart and his brothers at the house so they could take it before tomorrow. She got a 6-foot clawfoot tub (heavy!), a sink, the dishwasher (which was pretty new) and the <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002299.htm">Sitz bath</a> that the kids liked to play in.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The <a href="http://www.adt.com/">ADT</a> guy also came to the house to get us set up with the security system, which is required by the insurance company during the renovation.</p>

<p>We hired a neighbor kid to mow the lawn at least until we move in. He came over so we could meet and mowed it for the first time this evening. I used to have my own little lawn-mowing business when I was a kid so I love to help another kid in his business.</p>

<p>Megan also stopped by and we went out to dinner with her. Megan <a href="http://www.lbreport.com/obits/davewod.htm">lost a good friend</a> suddenly on Sunday morning to a brain aneurysm and needed a distraction. Gay knew him from high school too and I met him at <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/02/jon-megans-wedding/">Megan &amp; Jon’s wedding</a> less than 2 years ago – we sat at the same table with him, his girlfriend, his brother and his wife. A really nice guy. He was in good shape, only 40 and just had his first baby in February. It’s yet another reminder of how short life is and how suddenly and unexpectedly it can end.</p>

<p>We got the first look at the demolition progress. The kitchen is almost completely demolished, the room behind it is mostly demolished, they’ve removed the surface of one of the walls in the basement (proving it’s not load-bearing) and the master bathroom is mostly demolished. They also removed the carpet from the master bedroom and discovered a well-preserved maple floor. Nice. As suspected, the house seems to have zero insulation in the exterior walls. They just didn’t use insulation in 1909. This is important because there’s not much point in replacing the single-pane windows with more insulating double-pane windows if the walls themselves aren’t insulated. We will probably want to add insulation and put it in the rooms where we aren’t renovating with as little destruction to those areas as possible.</p>
