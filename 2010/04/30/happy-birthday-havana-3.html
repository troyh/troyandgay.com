    <p>Havana turned 3 today. Tomorrow is her party.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4568439727/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4031/4568439727_c09448f13e.jpg" alt="IMG_5515" /></a></p>

<p>While running this morning with my iPod on random, this song came on and I couldn’t help but think of Havana on her birthday:</p>

<blockquote>What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all 'round the sun

What a beautiful dream
That could flash on the screen
In a blink of an eye and be gone from me
Soft and sweet
Let me hold it close and keep it here with me

And one day we will die
And our ashes will fly
From the aeroplane over the sea
But for now we are young
Let us lay in the sun
And count every beautiful thing we can see</blockquote>

<p>As an adult, it’s easy to forget how short life is and how you don’t even know  how much time you have. Kids haven’t yet learned to think about time, the past or the future so they enjoy <em>now</em>. I hope both our kids never lose that.</p>

<p>Havana, I hope you’re as happy and have as much fun at 30 as you do at 3.</p>
