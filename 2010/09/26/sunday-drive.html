    <p>Gayâ€™s dad and aunts met us at the hotel restaurant for breakfast before we drove home. We were on the road by 11am, stopped in Ellensburg for lunch and were home on the 4pm ferry. The kids were good the entire drive, as usual, but Havana was sick of her car seat by the time we got the ferry dock and complained about having to get back in it to drive on the ferry. By 4:30 we were watching the 10am Steelers game on the DVR. A good end to a day of long driving.</p>
