    <p>We stopped for lunch outside Portland in Gresham. We picked up sandwiches from Subway and looked for a park where the kids could play after eating. We and another driver coming the opposite direction at an intersection  avoided being hit by an idiot who flew through a red light seemingly unaware that they almost slammed into 2 cars.</p>

<p>After lunch and play time at a windy park, we drove through Mt. Hood national park, by Mt. Hood and down to Bend. We checked into the hotel, The Oxford Hotel: great location, a big room, nice gym with a view and a unhurried noon check-out time. We had dinner at the original Deschutes brewpub just around the corner. The kids barely napped in the car so they went to sleep easily.</p>

<p>Bend is a sunny cute little town surrounded by snow-covered mountains. I could stay here another day or two.</p>

<p>We have a short drive today to Klamath Falls so weâ€™re going to stop by the Deschutes Brewery before we leave Bend and get some shirts or something.</p>
