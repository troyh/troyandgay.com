    <p>I’m documenting this here so I can diagnose myself the next time this happens…</p>

<p>On the flight back from San Francisco I put my in-ear headphones in and a few minutes later Gay said something to me so I took the right one out to hear her. The ear bud came off and was stuck in my ear and I couldn’t get it out. I had to wait until I got home 3 hours later to remove it. After removing it, I still felt like my ear was plugged. It started to hurt more and more over the next day.</p>

<p>Gay had a similar problem a couple years ago and was prescribed <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?id=8978"><strong>Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates and Hydrocortisone OTIC Suspension, USP</strong></a>. She didn’t use it all and kept it in her drawer. So I tried it. The next day the pain was gone and the day after that my ear was  fine again.</p>

<p>Before my next flight, I’m going to get noise-canceling headphones that don’t go in my ear.</p>
