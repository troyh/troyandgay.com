    <p>As of today, I’ve made 41 trips around the sun. I hope I get a lot more. Gay made me birthday dinner, as usual, and got a ton of nice beers for me to pick from while she cooked. Knowing I’d have wine with dinner, I took it easy and had Sierra Nevada’s 2010 Celebration Ale, one of my favorite winter beers.</p>

<p>Summary of my 41st year:</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Just a few days before my 40th last year, my dad had a sudden visit to the hospital and they found he had cancer in his kidney. <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/11/22/my-dad-is-cancer-free/">He had it removed</a> and is cancer-free.</p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/12/06/seattle-to-cabo/">We went to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico</a> for a winter vacation.</p>

<p>We were working with Tom Kundig on designing a new house on Vashon and were getting cold feet about staying on Vashon, so we took three trips, in <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/01/15/san-francisco-2/">January</a>, February (with Havana) and in March with both kids via <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/03/21/tahoe/">Tahoe</a>, to San Francisco to see about real estate there.</p>

<p>Havana had <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/03/25/havanas-first-ski-lesson/">her first ski lesson</a> while in Tahoe.</p>

<p>Hudson had his first (and hopefully last) <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/03/11/hudsons-first-stitches/">stitches</a> after mysteriously falling on something (we still don’t know).</p>

<p>We celebrated <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/04/30/happy-birthday-havana-3/">Havana’s 3rd birthday</a>.</p>

<p>We decided to not build the house on Vashon and <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/06/01/moving-back-to-seattle/">to buy a house in Seattle</a> instead. We finally <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/06/16/bought-a-house-in-seattle/">bought a house in Seattle</a> in June and closed on it July 19. It’s been under renovation ever since.</p>

<p>Gay and I celebrated <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/07/31/6th-wedding-anniversary/">our 6th wedding anniversary</a>.</p>

<p>Hudson <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/08/25/happy-birthday-hudson-2/">turned 2</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/08/04/baby-3-20-week-ultrasound/">Baby #3</a> was conceived and is mostly done.</p>
