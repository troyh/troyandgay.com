    <p><a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/11/10/we-should-let-gm-and-ford-die/">I didn’t like</a> that Obama bailed-out General Motors and thought it’d be a mistake, but it turns out that it was smart. Not only is GM profitable again, very profitable even, and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704104104575623061936893220.html?mod=WSJ_business_whatsNews">today had a new successful IPO</a>. American taxpayers have been paid-back for half the investment and the rest is sure to be repaid too. Obama and GM want the Federal Government out as soon as possible because it’s a conflict of interest to have the government be invested in a corporation, but it’s hard to argue that Obama hasn’t been the best GM CEO in many decades. I’m glad I was wrong. Good job and good luck, GM.</p>
