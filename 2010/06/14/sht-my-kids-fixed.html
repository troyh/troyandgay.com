  <article class="post-content">
    <p>This is one my favorite sites: <a href="http://shitmykidsruined.tumblr.com/">Shit My Kids Ruined</a>. I can relate. But I have to give my kids some credit. A few months ago our digital camera suddenly stopped working with the infamous “<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=canon+powershot+sd750+lens+error+restart+camera&amp;revid=1403638925&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g1IWTOeFLdfjnQfK8ZmPDA&amp;ved=0CFsQ1QIoAA">Lens Error. Restart camera.</a>” message – the lens gets stuck and won’t retract. We tried <a href="http://camerarepair.blogspot.com/2007/12/fixing-lens-error-on-digital-camera.html">the best instructions we could find</a> but couldn’t fix it. It was out of the warranty period so I bought a replacement camera for Mother’s Day and we let the kids have the broken one to play with – they love playing with things that have buttons. A couple days later I found it on the living room floor with the lens retracted. How’d they do that? No amount of pushing on it could get it to go back in for me. I decided to put the battery back in and see if it was fixed and it worked! <em>How’d they do that??!</em> Now we have two functioning cameras. Thanks kids!</p>
