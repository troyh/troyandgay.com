    <p>Hudson was bitten by a bug, we think, yesterday on his left eye and it turned pink. He woke up Friday morning with a completely swollen eye. It was almost completely closed! Gay and grandma took him to the doctor on their way to his scheduled haircut and got an antibiotic and some kidsâ€™ Claritin. It was much better by Saturday and practically back to normal by Sunday, thanks mostly to the Claritin. The doc said to stop giving him the antibiotic if it looks better.</p>

<p>The haircut was as bad as his eye. He used to have cool surfer-boy hair, but now looks like a dork. Good thing hair grows quickly.</p>
