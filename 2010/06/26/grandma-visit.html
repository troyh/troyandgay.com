    <p>My favorite mother-in-law made her annual visit this week. She arrived Monday, Gay and her went shopping, the kids entertained her during the day and she left Saturday.</p>

<p>Saturday afternoon, we went over to Jon &amp; Megan’s house for a barbeque. Megan ran the Seattle Rock &amp; Roll Marathon again this year (<a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/06/27/seattle-rock-n-roll-marathon/">Gay ran the half with her last year</a>). Megan’s parents, sister, nephew and niece, a few other friends who ran the marathon with her and other friends were also there. Jon bbq’d salmon. We left at 9:30pm and caught the 10:20pm ferry.</p>
