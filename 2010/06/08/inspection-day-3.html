    <p>Today was the sewer inspection. We weren’t there, but the real estate agent was and all went well. The inspection company sends a DVD (with popcorn) of a movie of the camera’s trip through the pipes. I’m not sure I want to watch it.</p>

<p>The only inspection left to do is a hazardous materials inspection. The house has a fair amount of 60s/70s era tile flooring which, together with the glue that was commonly-used, was later found to contain asbestos, which was later found to be harmful to humans, especially kids. Removing it is expensive because it has to be handled carefully and disposed of properly.</p>
