    <p>Forbes has <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2010/06/04/migration-moving-wealthy-interactive-counties-map.html">an interactive map</a> showing where people are moving to and from in the US.

<p>I’m not surprised, Seattle is a great place to live: temperate weather, good jobs, beautiful scenery, protected environment, great outdoor activities, progressive government. Kiplinger <a href="http://www.kiplinger.com/magazine/archives/10-best-cities-2010-for-the-next-decade.html">recently rated Seattle #2</a> in their list of top cities for the next decade. It’s good for Seattle – more people = bigger market = better services – but I don’t like the idea of Seattle becoming crowded. I moved away from the east coast (partly) because of all the people!</p>
