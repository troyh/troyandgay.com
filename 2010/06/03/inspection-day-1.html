  <article class="post-content">
    <p>We met the home inspectors at the house at noon. Jim Dow and Doug, from <a href="http://www.schuchartdow.com/">Shuchart/Dow</a>, and <a href="http://www.nbdesigngroup.net/">Nancy Burfiend</a>, the interior decorator who helped us with our current house, and a couple of her colleagues came over too. By 6pm we were all done. Two hours is my normal meeting limit so I was tired of talking.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>Gay and I stopped at <a href="http://www.smithseattle.com/">Smith</a>, a restaurant in our new neighborhood, for dinner and to relax before driving back to Vashon. Kelly had taken the kids to the museum and zoo in Tacoma, so they also had a long day but we got to see them before they went to bed.</p>

<p>We had a lot of information to process, so neither of us could sleep. We tried, but we didn’t get to sleep until after 2am.</p>

<p>The inspection went better than we thought. We were expecting major problems, like the entire exterior surface of the house had to be taken off and replaced, but that doesn’t appear to be the case. That’s good. The written report should tell us more. And next week we’ll have the contractor’s sub-contractors take a look.</p>
