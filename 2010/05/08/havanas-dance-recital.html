    <p>Havana had her first dance recital tonight. She’d been going to rehearsal for a few weeks, something parents weren’t allowed in to see. After about 45 minutes, Havana made her debut.</p>

<p>We had to leave at intermission so Gay could drop me off at Reid’s bachelor party at his dad’s cabin on the island. There I saw some Jon, Mark, Peter and Reid’s brother who I hadn’t seen in a long time as well as Mark and Reid, of course. I was late but they saved me the biggest steak I’ve ever seen, that was perfectly-cooked.</p>
