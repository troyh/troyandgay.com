    <p>This afternoon I heard and felt two loud explosions that shook the house. It felt like a bomb went off at the neighbor’s house. I thought it was a big earthquake because you always hear a loud sound when an earthquake starts. It turns out that Obama was in Seattle today (<a href="http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2009/01/07/when-and-where-obama-lived-on-this-capitol-hill">he lived on Capitol Hill as an infant</a>, by the way), a small sea plane inadvertently entered the restricted airspace around the President, <a href="http://www.kirotv.com/news/24664589/detail.html">two F-15 fighters scrambled to intercept</a> causing a sonic boom. I’ve never heard one before. The Pacific Northwest Seismic Network <a href="http://www.king5.com/news/local/Puget-Sound-area-rocked-by-sonic-booms-100922594.html?gallery=y&amp;c=y&amp;img=1#gallery-image">captured it</a> on their instruments.</p>
