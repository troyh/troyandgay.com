            <p>Just watched <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&amp;cf=info&amp;id=1807733433">Signs</a>. _Yawn. _M. Night Shyamalan is overrated. Why do bad directors think if actors talk slow and stare at each other a lot it’s good acting? And the kids in this movie were lame tools for weak comedy.</p>

            <p>News.com <a href="http://rss.com.com/2100-1040-982995.html?type=pt&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=news">reports</a> that people rank the internet as the most important source for information. No surprise there. But interestingly for us, is that they ranked magazines as least important. I’d  hate to be in the recipe magazine business!: <em>61.1 percent ranked the  the most important; 60.3 percent ranked books second important; 57.8 percent ranked newspapers third; 50.2 percent ranked television fourth; 40 percent ranked radio fifth; and 28.7 percent ranked magazines last</em></p>

<p>It’s also interesting that timeliness of information is not important to people, given the rankings. And reliability is not important, either, as the  is probably most prone to bogus info. It seems that importance is simply a mix of timeliness and accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>Importance:</strong>
1. Internet
2. Books
3. Newspapers
4. Television
5. Radio
6. Magazines</p>

<p><strong>Timeliness:</strong>
1. Internet
2. Radio
3. Television
4. Newspapers
5. Magazines
6. Books</p>

<p><strong>Reliability:</strong>
1. Books
2. Magazines
3. Newspapers
4. Television
5. Radio
6. Internet</p>

<p>Are there other ways to rank these that I’m overlooking?</p>

An aspirin, which helps to thin the blood, can also help.</em></p>
