            <p>We haven’t had a date night in a while, so we went out tonight since Elysian’s 2nd beer of their <a href="http://www.washingtonbeerblog.com/elysian-brewing-preparing-for-apocalypse/">12 Beers of the Apocalypse</a> release party was also happening. We got to Elysian about 10 minutes before 6pm and there was no line but all the tables were taken. We waited 10 minutes or so and then got a table within view of the festivities, kinda. I had the Rapture Heather Ale and watched Dick Cantwell, dressed as a Pope, give his speech.</p>

<p>We decided to not have dinner at Elysian and instead walk over to <a href="http://restaurantzoe.com/">Restaurant Zoë</a>, which has just opened again after being closed for their move from Belltown to Capitol Hill. We used to go to Zoë for any special occasion before we moved to Vashon and a few times since. I’m glad to have it open again and much closer to home. The new place’s decor is less “New York” (sophisticated, contemporary) and more “west coast” (casual, rustic) and the prices are a little lower. I liked the old place, but I like the new place too, and it’s more spacious, which I prefer. The old place had a great Ahi Tuna appetizer and a hangar steak that I always ordered, but they don’t have either on the new menu. That’s too bad. We had their “Regrade Manhattan” and I had the burger, both were very good.</p>

            <p>We happened across the movie <a href="http://theway-themovie.com/">The Way</a> tonight on Apple TV and decided to rent it. It was pretty good. I decided that, when the kids are old enough to hike long distances and before they are too old to want to spend a summer with us, we’ll take the kids to Spain and walk at least part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Way_of_St._James">El Camino de Santiago</a> trail. It seems like a cool way to visit some towns in Spain. Documenting it here as a <a href="http://troyandgay.com/tag/promise/">promise</a> to myself.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Our street’s 26th Annual Progressive Dinner was tonight. This was our second, <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/01/29/progressive-dinner-2011/">we went last year</a> for the first time. This year, we hosted the appetizer course and Gay made a few dishes. People started arriving at 5pm and we all left to the main course down at the Farrell’s house at 7. By 9:30 or so we were at the Zorn’s for dessert and the awarding of the Garden Award, which means we got rid of it from last year! We were among the last to leave and we were home at 10:45pm. We already know most of the people but we met a couple of neighbors we hadn’t yet met. It’s a great street to live on!</p>

            <p>Boy, was I wrong about Obama and GM. <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2008/11/10/we-should-let-gm-and-ford-die/">I thought</a> giving GM a bailout was going to be a huge mistake. Not only are they surviving, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/business/gm-back-on-top-in-world-automaking.html">they’ve regained the top position</a> in number of cars sold (Volkswagen is #2?!) and all those auto industry jobs were saved. Impressive, especially considering it’s only been 2 years. We’re all still owners of GM do we still need to be paid back, but it seems possible now. Sometimes government does work.</p>
