          <p>For this week’s date night we went to <a href="http://sitkaandspruce.com/">Sitka &amp; Spruce</a>, another place we’ve been trying to get to. They also do a bunch of small tasting plates. We got a 5 or 6 dishes and 2 were very good, the others were so-so. Before dinner, we had a cocktail at <a href="http://www.ferdinandthebar.com/home/">Bar Ferdinand</a>, which is in the Melrose Market building just a few feet from Sitka &amp; Spruce. After dinner, we had dessert at <a href="http://larkseattle.com/">Lark</a>, a place we haven’t been to in 7 years or so. I had a delicious fig tart and Gay got a cheese plate.</p>

          <p>We finally went to dinner at <a href="http://www.spinasse.com/">Cascina Spinasse</a>, a restaurant everyone keeps telling us to try. Our usual date night is Tuesday, when they’re closed and in March <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/03/23/gays-birthday-out/">we tried going</a> for Gay’s birthday but missed our reservation. After waiting so long, it was disappointing. They make their own pasta, but the pasta wasn’t especially good. The menu is in Italian with English translations but even those are somewhat indecipherable. The bar is limited, just one bourbon, one gin, etc. and only wine, not even an Italian beer. The rabbit meatballs were excellent, though. </p>

          <p>It took me a week, but I finally finished the garage handrail. While waiting for one piece to be welded by <a href="http://www.ballardsheetmetal.com/">Ballard Sheet Metal</a>, I finished the last bit of perforated aluminum sheeting on the walls and added some trim in the corners to finish it off.</p>
