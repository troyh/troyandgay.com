<p><a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/dan_gillmor/ejournal/4423774.htm">Dan Gillmor</a>: <em>So it was a bad day for competitive markets. And it’s a depressing day for anyone who had the slightest belief that our system doesn’t side with the rich and powerful. … The one chance is for people to realize what’s at stake and do something difficult: Make choices that mean less convenience today in order to have liberty tomorrow. Americans are lousy at this, but a lot is now at stake. You may not care. You should.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://jrobb.userland.com/2002/11/01.html#a2786">John Robb</a>: <em>This proves one thing.  As a society, we are still in denial about corporate abuses of power.  Law, like any other system is prone to distortion by the views of the people that apply it.</em></p>

          <p>Today’s my 33rd birthday. Gay got me a new pair of slippers (to replace the ones that Ouzo chewed up). I’m going to try to take the day off today. I went out and threw the ball with Ouzo in the front yard. It’s sunny but kinda chilly out with frost on the ground; a nice fall morning.</p>

<p>Recipezaar users posted some nice <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=19816&amp;53">birthday wishes</a> to me today. It’s nice to be appreciated (even if it is by strangers:-).</p>

<p>We’re going to go into the city today, have lunch at the Ale House in our old neighborhood, then to Abercrombie &amp; Fitch for some sweaters (mmmm sweaters) and maybe Borders for some CDs (need to scan Amazon for some suggestions). Then stop at Thriftway in West Seattle for groceries and a nice bottle of birthday dinner wine.</p>

It’ll cut down on our bandwidth costs since sending larger emails is “free”. But it will be harder for us to create the Eater’s Digest message. I created <a href="http://fumweb/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2211">bug #2211</a> to track this.</p>
