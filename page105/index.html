          </h3>
            <p>We packed the kids in the car right after their midday naps and went to Newcastle, WA to Julie and Hans’ house for <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/07/20/gays-mom/">Gracelyn</a>’s 1st birthday party. On the way home I resisted the <a href="http://www.frys.com/isp/renton.html">Fry’s</a> in Renton and we went to get takeout at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/buddha-ruksa-seattle">Buddha Ruksa</a> in West Seattle. I’m not sure why we did because we weren’t very hungry after eating at the party, but we ate a little of it when we got home and left most of it for dinner tomorrow night.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Jonathan Alter understands <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/209817/page/1">why healthcare reform should be stopped</a> and we should just let the insurance companies decide who gets good healthcare:</p>

<p>bq. Speaking of fair, it seems fair to me that cost-cutting bureaucrats at the insurance companies–not doctors–decide what’s reimbursable. After all, the insurance companies know best.</p>

<p>They sure do! Have you ever known a corporation to put profits ahead of the best interests of their customers? It’s absurd. The Republicans are right, the free market cures all ills. It makes perfect sense that healthcare should be run by corporations. We’ve proven it, how else could the US healthcare be <a href="http://www.photius.com/rankings/healthranks.html">ranked 37th in the world</a> in quality even though it’s <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2006-02/2006-02-28-voa59.cfm?CFID=263963748&amp;CFTOKEN=95142258&amp;jsessionid=0030287987ee69d7d80d13797f7f329537e7">the most expensive healthcare in the world</a>? It beats those losers in Slovenia at #38. People who complain that we’re #37 in quality ignore that we’re #1 in cost! America is #1! Woo hoo! The free market in healthcare is working like a charm.</p>

<p>I’m so sick of Americans whining about having to pay high fees for healthcare or having healthcare that doesn’t work for them – if they don’t want to pay or don’t want to deal with insurance companies, they shouldn’t get diseases, inherit genes from their parents, have injuries, etc. And people who worry about children whose parents can’t afford healthcare for them. Those kids should’ve selected their parents more wisely. What were they doing for those nine months in the womb?! We deserve the best military and the best economy, but we certainly don’t deserve the best healthcare. Even William Kristol, the smartest guy on TV because he never sways from Republican talking points, <a href="http://www.indecisionforever.com/2009/07/28/jon-stewarts-extended-bill-kristol-interview/">agrees that Americans don’t deserve the best healthcare</a>.</p>

<p>Republicans is smart.</p>

            <p>We went over to Reid’s father’s house in Burton for dinner with Reid, Steve and Deborah and their two kids, Sage and Pahr, Carrie and her (new, to us) husband, Joe who were visting from North Carolina.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We were married 5 years ago today. We went to <a href="http://www.tomdouglas.com/restaurants/dahlia-lounge">Dahlia Lounge</a>, the place we went <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2003/09/14/putting-a-ring-around-the-and/">the night we got engaged</a>, for a great dinner. Then we took a nice drive around the beach at <a href="http://images.google.com/images?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=alki+beach&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=M7F0Sua5F4iIsgP28czHCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=4">Alki</a> before coming home.</p>

<p>Thank you to those who sent us cards, if only we knew your wedding anniversaries!</p>

          </h3>
            <p>It’s been in the 90s all week. Yuck. It may even be the hottest day on record in Seattle, “it has never been over 100 here”:http://bit.ly/mN1op! But the evenings are perfect for drinking beer outside until 10pm.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3770128413/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2608/3770128413_8d1c17a797_o.jpg" alt="photo.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>At about 5:45pm we lost power, probably because of everyone blasting their A/C. We’ve never lost power in the summer before. I love our gas generator!</p>

<p>It did turn out to be “a record at 103”:http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2009558896_webhot29m.html. It hasn’t been this hot in Seattle since July 1994 and before that, 1941.</p>

<p>We may turn on the air-conditioner tomorrow.</p>
