            <p>Eric came down from Bellingham yesterday and spent the night with us. Today, Cindy, who is in town from NYC, and Steve &amp; Renuka and the kids came over for a barbecue.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>The guy from “2-D Floor Plans”:http://www.2dfloorplans.com/ came to the house to make as-built drawings of the house. We left the house just after 10am to catch the 10:30 ferry and found a long ferry line. One of the slips at the dock is under repair so the ferries were delayed. We missed the 10:30 ferry so had to wait for the 11:30, which was also late. Vashon ferry riders spend a lot of time waiting.</p>

<p>We got to the house at 12:30 and met Doug (Schuchart/Dow) and Dan (Olson Kundig) outside. We gave Dan a walk-through of the house, Andrew from 2-D Floor Plans finished his work and we we headed back home on the 4pm ferry.</p>

<p>A total of 2.5 hours waiting for ferries. Why do Vashon people oppose a bridge?!? I can’t wait to be living in the city again!</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Hudson was bitten by a bug, we think, yesterday on his left eye and it turned pink. He woke up Friday morning with a completely swollen eye. It was almost completely closed! Gay and grandma took him to the doctor on their way to his scheduled haircut and got an antibiotic and some kids’ Claritin. It was much better by Saturday and practically back to normal by Sunday, thanks mostly to the Claritin. The doc said to stop giving him the antibiotic if it looks better.</p>

<p>The haircut was as bad as his eye. He used to have cool surfer-boy hair, but now looks like a dork. Good thing hair grows quickly.</p>

            <p>My favorite mother-in-law made her annual visit this week. She arrived Monday, Gay and her went shopping, the kids entertained her during the day and she left Saturday.</p>

<p>Saturday afternoon, we went over to Jon &amp; Megan’s house for a barbeque. Megan ran the Seattle Rock &amp; Roll Marathon again this year (<a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/06/27/seattle-rock-n-roll-marathon/">Gay ran the half with her last year</a>). Megan’s parents, sister, nephew and niece, a few other friends who ran the marathon with her and other friends were also there. Jon bbq’d salmon. We left at 9:30pm and caught the 10:20pm ferry.</p>

            <p>Happy Father’s Day to me! This is my 4th Father’s Day (2nd with Hudson). I spent the rainy day inside by the fire reading a Father’s Day gift, “<a href="http://www.rationaloptimist.com/">The Rational Optimist</a>”, watched a World Cup game and a movie while Gay and the kids napped after a <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/06/19/washington-brewers-festival/">late night out</a> (for us) last night.</p>
