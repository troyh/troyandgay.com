              <p>We had our status meeting with the contractors via phone this morning. Katie and Mark were on vacation today so it was just us talking to Jim and Doug. That went well except that Gay’s iPhone 4 seems to be worse than the 3GS for reception.
<!-- more --> They still have more demolition to do but can start on framing the non-structural walls that don’t require a permit soon. We need to finish up some documentation and should be able to apply for our permit by August 31. Hopefully, we’ll get the permit immediately since we’re not messing with many structural walls. Schuchart/Dow is going to get us a list of critical decisions that we need to make so they can keep going and then provide the total list of decisions, in priority order, that we need to make with the architects and interior designers.</p>

<p>The most pressing are the exterior decisions. We need to determine how  few windows will move and/or be resized and the dimensions so they can do the rough-ins, then they can do the stucco work around them. Then we need to get the exterior colors selected so the exterior can be painted and “fog-coated” (coated with fog?) before the weather turns. And before that happens, we need to get the encasements for the existing windows repaired.</p>

              <p>We had a few meeting with the interior designers today. We met Nancy at a house that is being finished that she worked on that is similar to what they’re recommending for our house so we could see some of the things in-person. Then we met Lara at the house to do some measurements for the elevations they’re doing that show the cabinetry, wall-coverings, fixtures, etc. Then we went to their office to meet with Nancy, My and Lara to go over the fixtures and finishes. Lots of running around with no lunch.</p>

<p>While we were at the house, we saw that they had removed the plaster from one of the walls in the basement. Under the plaster is black tar-like stuff that we assume is for moisture protection. It looks kinda cool. The floor near that wall had some water damage years ago and the contractors think it was caused by holes they drilled partially into the concrete to put some weird decorations on the wall. They were filling the holes in and just about to put a coat of sealant on the wall, which would cover up the blackness. We thought it’d be cool to expose the wall that way. We talked about it a little with Doug and decided we should continue repairing that wall because we want to put insulation on the wall, but maybe we could do it on another wall. We sent some photos to the architects and the designers and they like it too. It’s good to stop in at the site periodically, you never know what you’ll discover.</p>

<p>We’re mostly done with the tile selection for the kitchen and bathrooms, but we’re still undecided on the floor and vanity for the master bath. We also need to decide on the color of the exterior, which we haven’t even started thinking about. We got a 1 square foot sample of the marble for our kitchen island to take home and abuse to see how it holds up.</p>

<p>They still like the <a href="http://www.dornbracht.com/en/">Dornbracht</a> fixtures and less-expensive <a href="http://www.hansgrohe-usa.com/us_en/index.htm">Hansgrohe</a> (the brother of <a href="http://www.groheamerica.com/">Grohe</a> has his own company) for the kids and less-used areas. Dornbracht is very popular with designers these days. They do look nice and I can’t find evidence that they’re anything but very well-made, but we just aren’t convinced they’re worth the price as far as reliability and serviceability are concerned. Is a plumber going to be surprised by a Dornbracht fixture when we call for a repair? Is it going to take 3 weeks to get a replacement part? They cost about 2x as much the same as a Kohler fixture costs and probably 3x 2x more than the cheapy stuff you find at Home Depot (Delta, Moen, American Standard, etc.). We have all Kohler fixtures in our house now and I haven’t been impressed with them; they’re just there. But they’re almost 20 years old and they’ve been reliable and don’t leak, which is something. I did some internet research and found that there is no brand that plumbers all agree are good. Ask 10 plumbers and you’ll get 10 different answers. And you have to wonder if they’re recommending the junk stuff so you have to call them to repair them more often. This seems to be one of the few areas in life where it’s hard to determine quality. In contrast, it’s hard to dispute that <a href="http://www.totousa.com/">Toto</a> toilets are the world’s best, seemingly in every way: quality, reliability, serviceability, appearance, ease of cleaning and water-efficiency. I wish the answer for other plumbing fixtures were as clear.</p>

<p><strong>Correction:</strong> We just got pricing for the fixtures. We were wrong about Dornbracht pricing. The Kohler fixtures we have in our master bath today are <em>more</em> expensive than the Dornbracht fixtures for the new master bath. And we hate the ones we have today. Kohler’s less-expensive but nicer-looking faucets all cost $1000+. Crikey, either Dornbracht is far more reasonable than we thought or Kohler is outrageous.</p>

<p>We’ve hired the lighting designer that was recommended by both Olson Kundig and Schuchart/Dow. He Facebook’d Gay… he is friends with one of Gay’s friends from college and my former boss at Microsoft. Small world. He’ll do his thing next week to give us recommendations for lighting, arguably the most important thing in interior design.</p>

<p>The hardwood floor in the basement is all removed now. We offered it to Kelly and they went over after work to go pick a truck-full of it up tonight.</p>

              <p>Gay went into Seattle for a doctor’s appointment and a hair appointment, then met the lighting guy at the house so he could provide an estimate to do the lighting design. She also went back to Albert Lee for more info on appliances so we could make our final decisions on those.</p>

<p>The asbestos abatement people finished on Monday so the house is asbestos-free and they’re taking up the hardwood floors from the basement. The floor in the basement has two levels, differing by 2 inches. We are going to level the floor by adding a layer of concrete to the low part so the hardwood floor has to be removed. The hardwood flooring is mostly in good shape with a nice patina and should be able to be used for something else. The tile flooring in the attic has been removed leaving decent fir flooring that we can refinish.</p>

              <p>This afternoon I heard and felt two loud explosions that shook the house. It felt like a bomb went off at the neighbor’s house. I thought it was a big earthquake because you always hear a loud sound when an earthquake starts. It turns out that Obama was in Seattle today (<a href="http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2009/01/07/when-and-where-obama-lived-on-this-capitol-hill">he lived on Capitol Hill as an infant</a>, by the way), a small sea plane inadvertently entered the restricted airspace around the President, <a href="http://www.kirotv.com/news/24664589/detail.html">two F-15 fighters scrambled to intercept</a> causing a sonic boom.

              <p>Got up at 5:30am, had breakfast, Kelly got here a little early and we got on the 8:15a ferry. Went to <a href="http://albertleeappliance.com/">Albert Lee</a> to look at appliances, <a href="http://www.bestplumbing.com/">Best Plumbing</a> and <a href="http://www.seattleinteriors.com/">Seattle Interiors</a> to look at fixtures, had a delicious lunch and a beer at <a href="http://brouwerscafe.blogspot.com/">Brouwer’s Cafe</a> and then went to Schuchart/Dow’s office to tour their metal shop and their wood shop. They have a very cool office space with lots of the exposed wood and steel plating that we like. The metal shop is industrial with big steel workbenches that came from Boeing. They were building a huge steel table for a client that was going to have an ice bucket in the middle of it. I wish I had taken a photo of it. The wood shop was building a couple sets of cabinetry and, thanks to my ability to ask a lot of dumb questions, we got a little education on wood and laminates. They’ll be building our cabinetry and I assume the metal shop will be making the steel for our deck railings and parts of doors.</p>

<p>Katie then took us to a few houses they worked on to see pivot doors they’ve made so we could see what we think of them and how we want ours to work. The walls in our family room will be doors that open up to create a bigger indoor/outdoor space. They’re too big to be supported by hinges, so they will pivot open instead. We wanted to see and touch similar doors. We were concerned that they’d be too heavy and difficult to open, but they aren’t. And they look very nice. We also saw a few “barn doors” in different styles that will be in various around the house. I can’t wait to see what our doors are going to look like.</p>

<p>We learned a few things at Albert Lee:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>All microwaves are made by either LG, Sharp or Panasonic. LG makes 80% of all microwaves, Sharp makes most of the rest and Panasonic makes a small number. Other brands put their case around them and different electronics to provide features (quick timers, reheat, popcorn, etc).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Microwave carousels are useless but people think they need them and won’t buy one without a carousel so they all have them. Microwaves heat the food uniformly but food naturally has cold and hot spots that people think carousels eliminate. They don’t. Stir the food instead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commercial Wolf stoves are made by Wolf, residential Wolf stoves are made by Sub-Zero (the parent company of Wolf).</p>
  </li>
