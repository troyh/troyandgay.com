          </h3>
            <p>We’ve made some pretty significant enhancements to the <a href="http://www.mywireservice.com">MyWireService beta</a>.  We now support creating your new newspaper sections, saved clippings are more accessible, and we’ve made it easier to get to past news, and a lot more, including working around a dumb CSS redraw bug in IE that made it almost impossible to read your news.  Did I mention that we added The Globe &amp; Mail for Bergy and we’re still looking for more Canadian news sources? ;-)  We actually feel good enough to start telling people about it.  So if you have a news junkie or weblogging friend, tell them about it.</p>

            <p>Criminey, only the Seattle Times would write <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/08/001611.php#001611">an article on an overpriced eBay auction item</a>. Worst newspaper ever. But it reminds me our friend who turned down $50,000 from someone who wanted his <a href="http://flee.com">flee.com</a> domain.</p>

            <p><a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2001374137_btdownload04.html">Some idiot thinks that In2gr8.net is a better name than Fine.com?</a> AND he thinks he can sell Fine.com for $69,000 on ebay?  We just went through this domain name/company name search for <a href="http://www.mywireservice.com">MyWireService</a>, so I know the hardships of trying to find a spellable, pronouncable name that someone isn’t already squatting on, but In2gr8.net Isnt2gr8.anything.  I almost peed my pants laughing when we called one of these squatters asking if they’d like to sell a domain we were interested in for $100 + whatever they’d paid for it so far.  “That is orders of magnitude below what we’d consider.”  I tried not to LOL through my “good luck.”  Maybe it makes me a socialist, but I think patents and domains should not get protection unless you actually make the thing you are patenting or use the domain for something.</p>

            <p><a href="http://video.movies.go.com/gangsofnewyork/">Gangs of New York</a> was good, but not Scorsese’s best work. The production was impressive and Daniel Day-Lewis (who left his job as a cobbler in semi-retirement from acting to make this movie) was amazing but the storytelling wasn’t as fluid or engaging as movies like <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/Goodfellas-1032176/">Goodfellas</a>. The story was confusing and seemed somewhat random but after watching a special from the Discovery Channel on the DVD, a lot of it made more sense in the history of New York. Many things were even true just shown in different orders or with different characters. But I’d have thought Scorsese would have done a better job at putting these things together into the story to make it more powerful. For example, Boss Tweed, the corrupt politician, seemed corrupt in the movie but not on the scale that he was in real life. And the gangs were far more organized in history than they seemed to be in the movie – they appeared as friends rather than organizations. And the firemen were ancillary in the movie but cornerstones of the neighborhood and the gangs in real life.</p>

<p>I feel like this movie was made more as an interesting story about NYC after 9/11 than something Scorsese really put thought into.</p>

            <p>We watched a <a href="http://www.discovery.com/">Discovery Channel</a> special on the <a href="http://video.movies.go.com/gangsofnewyork/">Gangs Of New York</a> DVD and learned that when policemen formed in NYC they were made fun of (or hated) because their uniforms looked like English policemen. So they eventually trimmed their uniforms down to just their badge on their chest that was made of copper. This is where the term “coppers” (and the shortened “cops”) came from to refer to the police.</p>
