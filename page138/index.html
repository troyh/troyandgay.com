          </h3>
            <p>Today is Troy’s 39th, or as he has been calling it: the 365th day before he turns 40.</p>

<p>Around here, you get to do whatever you want on your birthday, which for Troy has always meant dinner at home and the 24 hour illusion that you don’t have kids. ;)</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy the day.

            <p>Wow, she gets dumber and dumber. Radio hosts pranked Sarah Palin and she fell for it. Your average dumbass would know that they weren’t talking to the President of France within the first minute, but she’s not an average dumbass, she’s an extraordinary dumbass. She went on for 5 minutes and never figured it out – they had to tell her. Things he said that didn’t clue her in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>He says he loves to kill animals</li>
  <li>He talked about his wife in bed</li>
  <li>He told her that the French have an equivalent to Joe The Plumber called “Marcel with bread under his armpit”</li>
</ul>

<p>The comedians aren’t very funny, but she is a clueless twit. But the best part is when she starts by saying this:</p>

<p>bq. Thank you sir, we have such great respect for you, John McCain and I. We love you.</p>

<p>Sarah Palin and John McCain love and respect someone from France. That’s going to piss off a lot of xenophobic Republicans.</p>

<p>Listen to the audio:</p>

            <p>It’s not long before the worst President we’ve ever had is history. The best thing we can say about him is that it appears that he killed the Republican Party for the near future.</p>

            <p>After we went to renew my driver’s license and get a flu shot, Havana and Hudson had doctor’s appointments today; Havana had her 18-month checkup and Hudson had his 2-month checkup. They also each got a couple shots.</p>

<p>We walked down a fall-colored California Ave to <a href="http://www.igougo.com/entertainment-reviews-b18277-Seattle-Circa_Grill_and_Alehouse.html">Circa</a> for lunch, which usually has some nice beers on tap. I had <a href="http://www.bbaybrewery.com/">Boundary Bay</a>’s Harvest Ale, their Oktoberfest beer, which I liked a lot and was a nice Fall beer, and Gay had a “Grimbergen”:http://www.grimbergenbier.be/beers “Abbey Ale”, which I assume is really their Dubbel. It was good, but had a weird grape flavor to it.</p>

<p>I had a burger, Gay had a chicken sandwich and Havana had chicken tenders and fries:</p>
