              <p>My highlights of 2008, in chronological order:</p>

<p>I’m not much of a car person, but “buying a Lexus LS 460”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/01/05/new-car-2008-lexus-ls-460/ was a treat. It’s still a pleasure to drive and we took it to “Cannon Beach, Oregon”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/01/11/drive-to-cannon-beach-oregon/, “California”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/19/los-gatos-to-eugene-oregon/, “Vancouver”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/18/vancouver-3/ and “Whistler”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/19/whistler/. I hope to use it to take more driving trips in 2009. We took a “trip to Mexico”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/02/01/mexico-vacation/, not in the car, which was relaxing because we spent most of the time doing nothing.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>“Havana learned to walk”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/04/16/havana-walking/, we celebrated “her 1st birthday”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/04/30/happy-birthday-havana/ and “threw her a party”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/03/havanas-1st-birthday-party/. She’s really grown-up this year and I have a lot of fun playing with her and watching her learn.</p>

<p>We took a “trip to Florida”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/04/14/florida-trip/. I didn’t (and still don’t) like Florida much at all, but it was good to see my parents, brother and sister-in-law.</p>

<p>“Getting a Kindle for Father’s Day”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/06/15/fathers-day-2008/ has encouraged me to read a lot more and I’ve done that. I read 20 or 25 books this year, which must be a record for me. I wish I had it on all the trips we took this year, it’d be great for traveling! I hope to continue to read books at a steady rate in 2009 because I’ve got quite a stack of books waiting for me.</p>

<p>“Hudson’s birth”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/25/hudsons-birth/ was one of the two biggest highlights of my life, and certainly of the year. Two years ago I didn’t have any kids and today I’m the father of <em>two</em> kids. He’s only 4 months old so he’s just starting the period where he will grow up quickly. 2009 should be a lot of fun with him and Havana.</p>

<p>We gave ourselves “4th wedding anniversary presents”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/12/anniversary-presents/ that I hope to have forever. I don’t have many keepsakes, these are precious ones.</p>

<p>“My 39th birthday”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/11/01/troys-birthday/ was my usual quiet affair, the way I like it. Hitting 39 is only a highlight because I’m not yet 40.</p>

<p>Ah, politics was big this year. Being a Hillary Clinton supporter, it wasn’t looking good for a while there, but I really enjoyed “the beginning of McCain’s implosion”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/30/mccain-proves-he-is-a-moron/ and the many shockingly stupid mistakes he made. The finale with an “Obama victory”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/11/05/obama/ will be a moment I doubt I’ll ever forget. Not since 1992 have I felt more optimistic about America.</p>

<p>Finally, my favorite holiday, “Thanksgiving”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/11/27/thanksgiving-2008/, reminded me of everything I have to be thankful for.</p>

<p>The lowlight of the year was “Ouzo dying”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/09/11/ouzo-1999-2008/, on 9/11, of all days. I miss him.</p>

<p>My beers of the year were “Deschutes’ The Abyss”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/29/deschutes-brewerys-the-abyss/, “Raison D’Extra”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/24/dogfish-head-raison-dextra/, the second of which I plan to have tonight for New Year’s Eve, and “Stone Imperial Russian Stout”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/07/03/stone-imperial-russian-stout/, which I did have two of this year.</p>

<p>Best music of the year: Coldplay’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RPTQ1C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000RPTQ1C">Viva La Vida</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000RPTQ1C" alt="" /> (say what you will, it’s a great album), Colin Meloy’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013P6TK6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013P6TK6">Colin Meloy Sings Live!</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0013P6TK6" alt="" />, Ryan Adams’ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GJ7ZMK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001GJ7ZMK">Cardinology</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001GJ7ZMK" alt="" />, Decemberists <em>Always the Bridesmaid</em> EPs, Mogwai <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CVCBLM?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001CVCBLM">Hawk Is Howling</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001CVCBLM" alt="" />, Sigur Ros <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ACY8D2?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001ACY8D2">Med Sud I Eyrum Vid Spilum Endalaust</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001ACY8D2" alt="" />.</p>

<p>Best books of the year:</p>

<p>Easily the best book I read all year was Alice Schroeder’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553805096?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0553805096">The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0553805096" alt="" />. I couldn’t put this book (the Kindle, actually) down, often staying up until 1am until I couldn’t keep my eyes open. Warren Buffett is an interesting and quirky guy with an obsession, collecting money, which almost completely destroys his personal relationships.</p>

<p>John Bogle’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470398515?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0470398515">Enough: True Measures of Money, Business, and Life</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0470398515" alt="" />, which is less repetitive than previous books and a good message for us all.</p>

<p>Tom Perkins’ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592404030?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1592404030">Valley Boy: The Education of Tom Perkins</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1592404030" alt="" />. Love him or hate him, he invented modern venture capital, which has had an enormously positive impact on the world we live in. He’s had an interesting personal life too.</p>

<p>Steven Landsburg’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416532226?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1416532226">More Sex Is Safer Sex: The Unconventional Wisdom of Economics</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1416532226" alt="" />, always a fun economics writer. I love his proof that an increasing population is good for the world and his simple argument against black-and-white thinking that seems to pervade society today: arguing for extreme solutions, rather than middle-ground solutions, is akin to concluding that, because eating less will make you lose weight and live longer, eating nothing will make you live forever.</p>

<p>The other book I couldn’t put down until I finished it was James Conaway’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618257985?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0618257985">Napa: The Story of an American Eden</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0618257985" alt="" />. Who knew the rise of Napa Valley was so colorful, political and downright fascinating?</p>

<p>Robert Mondavi’s inspiring companion to Conaway’s <em>Napa</em> (and partial attempt at modesty), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0156010569?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0156010569">Harvests of Joy: How the Good Life Became Great Business</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0156010569" alt="" />. Sadly, Robert Mondavi died this year.</p>

<p>Thomas Friedman’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374166854?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0374166854">Hot, Flat, and Crowded: Why We Need a Green Revolution–and How It Can Renew America</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0374166854" alt="" />, which I haven’t yet finished, but it’s a page-turner, even if I’m not convinced by all his points.</p>

<p>Matthew Bishop’s and Michael Green’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1596913746?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1596913746">Philanthrocapitalism: How the Rich Can Save the World</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1596913746" alt="" />, just for insight into the difficulties of effective philanthropy.</p>

<p>I (half-heartedly) recommend Eric Weiner’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/044669889X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=044669889X">The Geography of Bliss: One Grump’s Search for the Happiest Places in the World</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=044669889X" alt="" />, not because of any wisdom it gives, but because it’s an example of the futility of searching for happiness outside yourself.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>The last of my packages from Christmas were finally delivered today as well as a few more that I didn’t have tracking numbers for that were also delayed for a long time. After “I posted about my problems”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/12/29/seattle-ups-sucks/, several people posted their similar stories. “The Kitsap Sun”:http://www.kitsapsun.com/news/2008/dec/30/ups-still-working-on-holiday-backlog/, a tiny newspaper (way) outside of Seattle, is the only place I’ve seen this story covered in the local media.</p>

<p>What is amazing to me about UPS is how poorly they handled this. Lots of packages for Christmas is not new to UPS and neither is weather. As bad as the weather was in Seattle, it wasn’t <em>that</em> bad and certainly minor compared to the weather they get in other parts of the country. They obviously don’t have a system in place to handle a case like this.</p>

<p>Severe weather can be understood and customers are generally forgiving of unusual circumstances, but only if the company can communicate effectively. UPS can’t. Their customer service, in my experience, was dismissive of the problem and was not interested in finding a solution for me and expressed absolutely no interest in improving the company for such situations in the future. As another sign of a company with problems, UPS in California “had to apologize for labeling a customer a terrorist”:http://www.turnto23.com/north_river_county/18385526/detail.html because he wore a turban. These problems are caused by poor management – employees are powerless and uninformed, suggestions for improving the company are clearly not welcome and their is little evidence of pride in being a UPS employee. UPS is unlikely to ever be a great company.</p>

<p>Here’s my updated list of deliveries, clearly 2nd Day Air got short shrift:</p>

<p>Ground packages were idle in Seattle for an average of 6.67 days, 2nd Day Air packages were idle for 8.67 days, or 30% longer even though it cost twice as much to send them 2nd Day Air. If/when I ever ship anything UPS, I’ll never choose anything but UPS Ground – it’s cheaper and higher-priority.</p>

              <p>Humans are lousy at making correct rational decisions in life. The brain is easily tricked by things that only matter to the irrational part of the brain. For example, people prefer to get $50 now rather than $60 one month later because being patient is rational. When told an item is now on sale, people think they’re getting a good deal even though they wouldn’t have paid the sale price before finding out about the sale. People fear terrorism but not swimming pools even though you are many many more times likely to die in a swimming pool than in a terrorist attack (this is also why terrorism is so powerful a tool).</p>

<p>The author of the great book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400077427?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1400077427">Stumbling on Happiness</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1400077427" alt="" />, gave a talk at TED that talks about these things:</p>

<p><a href="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf">http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf</a></p>

<p>One of the points he makes is about comparison-shopping. This is something I learned years ago. Just in the last year, I’ve had several conversations about people who are thinking about buying a new TV. When I tell them that I just go to Amazon.com, sort by best-selling, read the reviews of several items and buy one, they think that’s dumb. They believe going to the store to compare TVs side-by-side is the smart way to select a TV. I always say “But when you’re at home watching it, you never remember that other TV in the store”. I think I save a lot of money (and time!) this way and Daniel Gilbert explains why.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>This year I finished all my (online) Christmas shopping early, or so I thought. UPS deliveries would be reasonably on-time, “much better than FedEx”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2003/10/31/fedex-still-sucks/, or so I thought. Of the 5 packages I ordered for Gay, only 2 arrived on schedule. One arrived today and the other 2 still have not been delivered as of today. Three other packages that were sent to us have still not arrived as well. UPS blames it on the snow we had in Seattle, but that excuse is a lie.</p>

<p>How do I know? We received deliveries from UPS on Monday and Wednesday before Christmas, which is after Sunday, the last day it snowed in Seattle. So clearly UPS could get to our house to make deliveries. The Seattle UPS hub is where the problem was.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> fortunately, all my packages <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/12/31/seattle-ups-finished-sucking-for-me-at-least/">made it to me today</a>, Dec 31. To all those who commented, I hope yours get t you today too.</p>

<p>Understanding the snow delay, I called UPS to see if I could pick the packages up myself in Seattle before Christmas. I talked to the UPS call center and requested to have someone from the Seattle hub call me. I’ve never had to do this with UPS but I have done it with FedEx twice and received calls from the local facility in 2-3 hours. I was assured that someone would call me. After 5 hours, I hadn’t heard from UPS so I called back and requested it again. By 4pm I still hadn’t heard from them so I called UPS a third time to request a call.</p>

<p>I explained to the UPS customer service rep that I’d like to get the package before Christmas and wanted to talk to someone to know if it was possible for me to pick it up myself. They explained that “a lot of people” are calling for the same reason and was told that they are under “strict orders” to not contact Seattle and the Seattle employees are “prohibited” from calling any customer. Customers who wanted to alleviate UPS’ backlog and get their packages in time for Christmas were to be ignored. In other words, the UPS official company policy is to provide service that is unconcerned about their customers, even at the most time-critical time of the year.</p>

<p>If you look at the table above, you’ll notice that Ground deliveries generally came before 2nd Day Air deliveries even when shipped <em>later</em>. UPS was able to deliver to our house on December 22 and 24. Had the packages been on the trucks that delivered those packages I would have received them before Christmas. But they weren’t. I asked the UPS customer service about that and was told that “when packages are sorted at the facilities, 2nd Day Air packages are no different than Ground packages”. What?! 2nd Day Air deliveries, which cost considerably more, are not prioritized before Ground packages? So I imagine if you go to the UPS facility in Seattle there’s a pile of packages that have been sitting there for two weeks now that are being ignored and even if they are sorted, they are unlikely to be delivered anytime soon.</p>

<p>In comparison, I also shipped three packages via FedEx, two to myself (Tracking “9612019593532680281592”:http://www.fedex.com/Tracking?action=track&amp;tracknumbers=9612019593532680281592 and “9612019593532680287709”:http://www.fedex.com/Tracking?action=track&amp;tracknumbers=9612019593532680287709) and one to Spokane, WA (Tracking “9612019860492980278878”:http://www.fedex.com/Tracking?action=track&amp;tracknumbers=9612019860492980278878). Those were all delayed by the snow (Spokane had more than twice as much snow as Seattle) but FedEx delivered them on Saturday and Sunday. This was unusual because FedEx (and UPS) do not deliver to my house on weekends normally and FedEx doesn’t deliver at all on Sundays anywhere. FedEx seemed to be making an effort to make up for the delay. UPS seems to have taken the weekend off in spite of their backlog of packages to be delivered. FedEx seems to be more concerned with their customers than UPS is.</p>

<p>UPS has some serious management problems, especially in the Seattle facility.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>One of my Christmas presents was a few glasses for different styles of beer: a goblet, a “nonic”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pint_glass and a snifter. Gay also found “Pliny The Elder”:http://www.russianriverbrewing.com/web/brews/plinytheelder.htm from Russian River Brewing Company at our local grocery store and made 2 bottles of it my stocking-stuffer. I’ve been trying to find this beer for several months after reading about how incredible it is. Beer-reviewer William Brand even considers it “his best beer of the year”:http://www.ibabuzz.com/beer/2008/12/26/best-and-worst-of-2008-pliny-and-light-lager/:</p>

<p>bq. This is simply awesome double IPA: 8% percent, 100 IBUs. And Russian River got it right in bottles. Is the bottled version or the tap version best? That’s a taste test I haven’t tried. They’re pretty close, I believe and that makes bottled Pliny my “best of” this year.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3147837229/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3227/3147837229_a7927b7852.jpg" alt="Pliny the Elder" /></a></p>

<p>It’s become one of my “white whale” beers since it’s only available in a small number of stores in the San Francisco area and “they are very particular about what stores they distribute it to”:http://www.ibabuzz.com/beer/2008/07/21/where-pliny-the-elder-in-bottles-can-be-found-today/, requiring refrigeration in storage.</p>

<p>The outside of the label reads:</p>

<p>bq. Respect your elder. Keep Cold. Drink Fresh. Pliny the Elder is a historical figure, don’t make the beer inside this bottle one! Not a barley wine, do not age! Age your cheese, not your Pliny! Respect hops, consume fresh. If you must, sit on eggs, not on Pliny! Do not save for a rainy day! Pliny is for savoring, not for saving! Consume Pliny fresh or not at all! Does not improve with age! Hoppy beers are not meant to be aged! Keep away from heat!</p>

<p>After reading that, I decided it was best to drink it sooner rather than later. So I did.</p>

<p>You can really smell the fresh hops, one of the freshest beers I’ve ever tasted (mine was bottled on Nov 4), which is not surprising given that it’s an Imperial IPA so it’s loaded with hops. It’s a well-balanced beer, which is hard to do in an Imperial IPA, very much like Dogfish Head’s 90-Minute IPA, but much less hoppy than their “120-Minute IPA”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/06/08/dogfish-head-120-minute-ipa/ or Stone’s Ruination IPA, which really does ruin my taste buds for a while afterwards. Interestingly, Dogfish Head’s label on their 120-Minute IPA says “Ages Well”. Go figure.</p>

<p>It’s not as citrus-y as I’d have expected, but nothing in it is overpowering. The body is a little on the light side, or maybe I’m  just used to all the heavy winter beers I’ve been drinking lately. I hope my local grocer keeps it in stock year-round because this would make an incredible beer on a hot summer day. All in all, a wonderful beer. I’m glad I have a second one.</p>
