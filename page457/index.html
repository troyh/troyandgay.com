          <p>Probably the most optimistic news I’ve seen about  since leaving in 1999. This makes me (somewhat) optimistic that people are not believing Microsoft’s lies. <a href="http://opensource.org/halloween/halloween7.php">Eric Raymond’s take on the latest Halloween Documents</a>: <em>Messaging that discusses possible Linux patent violations, pings the OSS development process for lacking accountability, raises the specter of possible security flaws, and the like are only marginally effective in driving unfavorable opinions around OSS and Linux, and in some cases backfire. On the other hand ‘positive? OSS and Linux messaging, i.e. access to the source code, the price, lower TCO, the ability to freely make copies, and the like drive very favorable opinions around OSS and Linux, both across geographies and audiences.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/archives/2002_11.shtml#000596">Lessig’s thoughts</a>: <em>it is critical that we support those fighting to defend the GPL. Eric’s optimism reflects the good news about the spread of Open Source and Free Software. But this feels a bit about like the crowing around DR-DOS. The war here has just begun. The course we must “stay” must include the defense of a core part of the Free and Open Source software ecosystem: GPL.</em></p>

          <p>We took the dogs for a walk after lunch and went to vote this afternoon.</p>

<p>At 11pm, Republicans maintain control of Congress. Probably means Bush will be unelected in 2004 cuz he won’t fix the economy and can’t blame the Democrats. Locally, R-51 lost (good) and I-776 lost (good) which are both pro-Monorail in a way. Oddly, the monorail initiative is “too close to call” as of 11pm at 51% to 49% with 25% of the votes in.</p>

<p>At 11:25pm, the Monorail is winning!: 52% to 48%.</p>

<p><em>Monopolies are fought best through innovation. Technology watchers were outraged when the Reagan administration dropped the government’s longstanding antitrust action against IBM. Given the green light, IBM went back to its monopolistic ways, threatening to squash upstarts like Compaq and .It didn’t work, partly because end-users hated IBM and what it stood for, partly because Microsoft offered an open world to developers. Today the Ze Ayalas of the world harbor similar enmity toward . Their bandwagon is Linux and open-source software.</em></p>

<p>I can’t believe I agree with Paul Andrews.</p>
