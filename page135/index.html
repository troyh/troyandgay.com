        <article>
          <p>Watch this compilation of financial shows with Peter Schiff starting more then two years ago predicting the housing crash, the credit crunch and a long recession while all the other “experts” literally laughed at him and called him “pessimistic”:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/2I0QN-FYkpw&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1">http://www.youtube.com/v/2I0QN-FYkpw&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1</a></p>

<p>Ben Stein, proving that bad actors should not go on TV pretending to be economists, even declared Merrill Lynch “an astonishingly well-run company” – less than a year later Merrill Lynch doesn’t exist anymore, they were so well-run.</p>

<p>And it’s all mostly Fox News, which again, proves that if you watch Fox News and believe what comes out of the speaker your brain is filled with falsehoods.</p>

        <article>
          <p>The Steelers won and the extra touchdown that was nullified wouldn’t have made a difference. But the refs in the game were worst I’ve seen in many years.</p>

<p>They correctly called the touchdown and had the players line up for the extra-point attempt before the refs in the booth stopped it to review the play to see if Polamalu scored. The result of the review was that there was nothing to review, but then the refs on the field huddled and decided, without a review, to declare the game over and the touchdown nullified.</p>

<p>This play was obviously a legal play and a touchdown, a novice football watcher could have seen this was clearly a touchdown. Watch the play:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/OQ50HtU6BSM&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1">http://www.youtube.com/v/OQ50HtU6BSM&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1</a></p>

<p>Where was the “illegal forward pass”?!? Both were clearly backwards passes. And minutes after the game, the head ref, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Green_(American_football_official)">Scott Green</a> “admitted he screwed up”:http://post-gazette.com/pg/08322/928592-66.stm:</p>

<p>bq. “We should have let the play go through in the end, yes,” Green said.</p>

<p>What changed in the few minutes between his two decisions? Did he look at a review of the play? Did his memory of the play change?</p>

<p>They also called a pass-interference on the Steelers that was clearly not pass-interference – the offensive player ran into the Steelers player and the Steelers player was flagged. And they called a holding penalty on another Steelers touchdown where the Steelers blocker fell down and brushed the side of another player – the Steelers had to kick a field goal.</p>

<p>I generally don’t like to blame the refs since there are always bad or questionable calls in every game – life’s not perfectly fair. But these refs sucked. I hope the Scott Green and his team of refs never ref another NFL game.</p>

          <p>I didn’t even know this, but it’s perfectly legal to be naked in Washington:</p>

<p>bq. Under state law, public nudity is not illegal unless it is an affront to someone else or causes alarm, Potter said.</p>

<p>Six (<em>six!</em>) people complained about a protest of naked bicyclists riding from <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Gas+Works+Park&amp;geocode=CaHrWtm0LMXKFcoB1wIdQlG1-CEJj0pPuWGHgg&amp;dirflg=&amp;daddr=seattle+center,+seattle&amp;f=d&amp;dq=Gas+Works+Park&amp;sll=47.645895,-122.33522&amp;sspn=0.006295,0.006295&amp;cid=47645130,-122334910,9405593795313700617&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;z=15">Gas Works Park to Seattle Center</a> so a proposal to ban public nudity was put before the Seattle Parks and Recreation. “It was rejected”:http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008393671_parks15m.html.</p>

<p>Even though public nudity has been legal forever without problems, this could have been yet another case of a few people scared of something harmless using the government to force their personal beliefs on everyone else. But Seattle refused to be bullied by these extremists. Good for Seattle.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I’m sure there are conservative extremists who will take this to the illogical conclusion and decide that Seattle is saying that it’s okay for adults to have sex with children in public or some other ridiculous conclusion. Oh wait, it’s already happening. Check out the comments on the article, a couple crazies offended by this are not from Seattle, of course:</p>

<p>bq. kiml from Shelton, WA: Seattle is all about the individual and the city leaders seek to drive out family. The city leaders are so liberal, just like all the nudists, gays and child molesters who voted them in that I wouldn’t be surprised if after each meeting they have wild sex parties. They probably invite their dogs too. Why not? If one thinks it’s ok to flash their ugly naked body in front of children, then it makes you wonder why wouldn’t their open minds open wider and seek to have a society in which anything goes? Welcome to Sodom and Gommorah, the city perverted from the top on down.</p>

<p>Driving out family? I have a family and I think this ruling encourages communities and families to be accepting of diversity. What’s the worst that can happen? My kids see a naked person? Why is that a problem?</p>

<p>bq. swb27 from Spokane, WA: Anyone notice a trend here? These nudi-rads want to “move” people out of where they live. Sort of reminds me of Nazi Germany’s answer to the “Jewish problem”…</p>

<p>It doesn’t take long for dummies to resort to Hitler comparisons, does it?</p>

          <p>“An Oregonian has admitted”:http://www.katu.com/news/34292654.html to losing $400,000, cashing out her husband’s IRA and mortgaging her house, to a Nigerian email scam. This is the most amazing part:</p>

<p>bq. When Spears began to doubt the scam, she got letters from the President of Nigeria, FBI Director Mueller, and President Bush. Terrorists could get the money if she did not help, Bush’s letter said. Spears continued to send funds. All the letters were fake, of course.</p>

<p>It took her months to start to think it was a scam, which is pathetic. But she was convinced it was real when she received letters claiming to be from President Bush insisting that it’s real. It never dawned on her that the President of the US really wants this person’s money freed from Nigeria but won’t allocate a tiny amount of federal money to do it, he expects this woman in Oregon to do it. This made sense to her. I can imagine how inauthentic the letters looked too. Stupid is as stupid does.</p>
