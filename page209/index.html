          </h3>
            <p>A Seattle coffee shop <a href="http://wifinetnews.com/archives/005325.html">cut off their free Wi-Fi on weekends only</a> last week because customers sat there all day with their laptops. Of course, some customers didn’t like the decision:</p>

<blockquote>One poster referred to Victrola management as "Wi-Fi Nazis"; another accused Victrola of "trying to increase turnover to get more proﬁt per table"-the implication being, of course, that businesses should have other interests than proﬁt in mind. "People have talked about how we're horrible capitalist pigs," an exasperated Strongin says. "They think we're sitting in our Victrola mansion laughing about all the extra cash we're making."</blockquote>

<p>I know how they feel. :)  And I bet there were more than a few people with the old “I paid $1.29 for my coffee, you OWE me free Wi-Fi!” completely ignoring the fact that they got a coffee for that $1.29. As usual, those who take the proper perspective realize the truth:</p>

<blockquote>Meanwhile, supportive customers, who outnumbered opponents on the blogs by at least two to one, have noted that businesses like Victrola have every right to expect customers to pay their way. Caffe Ladro, down the street, offers free wi-ﬁ, but only for one hour; Starbucks, the only other coffee shop on that stretch of 15th Avenue, charges $29.95 a month.</blockquote>

          </h3>
            <p>Google’s <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code</a> offers students $4,500 to work on open source projects this summer. Very cool. That’s $1,500 for each of three months of the summer, or $9.38/hr. When I was in college, I worked as a night security guard in an office building (which requires doing absolutely nothing, so I got paid to do homework) and was paid $9/hr. Granted, that was 1990 dollars, but if I could have been paid to work on Apache, Mono, Subversion, Nmap, etc., wow.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>I spent my Memorial Day weekend building my first Tiger Dashboard widget. It’s a monitor for <a href="http://ganglia.info">Ganglia</a>, which is what we use to monitor our server clusters. I wanted this ever since I heard about <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/">Dashboard</a> and now I have it. No more refreshing a web page to see the quick status of all the servers.</p>

<p>It should work with anyone’s Ganglia setup, if you install <a href="http://troyandgay.com/public/ganglia.phps">the PHP script</a> that feeds it the XML data it needs and <a href="http://troyandgay.com/public/Ganglia.wdgt.zip">download the widget</a>. Put the PHP script somewhere on your server. You’ll have to modify the code right now to set the URL to that PHP script. Later, I’ll make it configurable from the widget itself (or you can). Consider it GPL’d, so please feel free to improve it but let me know so I can have the improvements too. :)</p>

<p>TODO list:
1. Make the flipside of the widget to set configurable options.
2. Display a history graph like the Apple-supplied stocks widget.
3. Make the clusters clickable to go to the standard Ganglia web page for the cluster
4. Make it prettier.</p>

            <p><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/tips_for_getting_good_customer_support.php">37signals deals with the same customer support issues we do</a>. People starting their questions with threats and treating us as if we’re monsters and not people are very common things we see too. It seems everyone wants a company to behave like a person, but the second you do, BAM!, they start swinging. Not everyone, of course, or even most, but definitely many. I now have a much better understanding of why companies act like robots instead of people – it’s the only way to survive mentally.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.careerjournal.com/columnists/workfamily/20050520-workfamily.html">Men do more housework than women think</a>. Women still do more than half, but men’s contributions are underestimated. Tell me about it! :)</p>

<p>I generally do the dishes, I do all the regular yardwork and I clean the garage and do all the recycling. I always clean the dog’s vomit too even when it’s “her dog” that does it. Gay does the majority of daily cooking and always does the laundry (I don’t need clean clothes!), though. While I admit Gay does more total work than I do, I do believe my contributions are underestimated. :(</p>
