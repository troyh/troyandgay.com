          </h3>
            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/maryandlinda.jpg" alt="mary and linda" />Our neighbor Mary married us, and now she and her partner Linda (on the right) are looking to adopt.  They put up <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~marinmartinez/">their adoption website</a>, which tells all about them. Birth mothers can browse potential adoptive families, and select the one they want their babies to go to.  Things have changed greatly (and for the better) since I was adopted.</p>

<p>Mary &amp; Linda are wonderful people and fabulous neighbors.  Troy and I have had long conversations with Mary about love and marriage and family, for her to feel comfortable endorsing our own union last year, so I know a lot more about them than you do most people you share a street with and an occasional party invitation.  Any baby would be super lucky to be a part of their lives, so if you know of anyone who might not be in the right situation for a child now, I encourage you to think about them.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

            <p>Our friends the Bennedsens recently went digging Geoducks [GOO-EEE-DUCKS].  Not an easy enterprise, because they live several FEET deep and are fast diggers, but always a very funny one.  <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/r/212/427/ls=p">Geoducks do make the best clam chowder</a>

          </h3>
            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/hofsayers.jpg" alt="gale sayers" />The story I had always told of my name is wrong: I had thought my mom adapted the Scottish name “Gaelen” into “Gay Lynn” after discovering the name while browsing magazines at the dentist’s office.  I had always imagined it was some swashbuckling swordsman, Gaelen, a dragon-slayer perhaps, whose story was told in some glamour magazine.  I imagined a real hero’s tale, accompanied by some type of captivating historical illustration.  His lyrical name repeated over and over in the story, echoing even in the last line of story…</p>

<p>A couple of years ago the topic came up at dinner with my mom and Troy.  Turns out, Gaelen was a football player whom my mom remembered as dying young from cancer, in a Reader’s Digest story she flipped through at the beauty parlor.</p>

<p>I decided to look up my namesake on the internet recently and there were no Gaelens in the NFL.  After a little research by both mom and me, it turns out I’m named for <a href="http://sayers.com/sayers_meetgale.html">Gale Sayers</a>!  Gale’s autobiography, “I Am Third,” came out right around when I was born and was subsequently turned into the movie “Brian’s Song”.  It was his roommate Brian Piccolo who died of cancer.  Gale is still alive and a successful business man in Chicago, coincidentally in computer software.</p>

<p>Is it strange to know you are named after a football player? Yes, especially if you a a girl.  At least I was named after a Hall of Famer, whom Mike Ditka said is the best player he’s ever seen, and who still holds the record for the most TDs in a game (6 v. the 49ers).  I just wish I would have known it when I saw “Brian’s Song” in 8th grade.</p>

<p>Mom said she liked the name because she thought it would work well if the adoption agency came through with either a boy or a girl. Troy’s not sure if he is remembering this wrong, but he remembers seeing Gale Sayers as a walk-on in a “Brady Bunch” episode where he explained that kids made fun of his name, because it was a girl’s name.  So I guess that is something else Gale Sayers and I have in common, though I suspect that a boy Gale Gilmore or Gay Gilmore would have been teased more than a girl Gay Gilmore, but for completely different reasons.  That said, I think boy Gale Gilmore could have better leveraged being named for Gale Sayers.</p>

<p>Are you named for someone?</p>

Coincidentally, <a href="http://www.insertcardfully.com/2005/05/play_a_game_of_.html">Elizabeth’s father died last month</a>.  Perhaps our blogroll is cursed.  Perhaps people just die, when you least and most expect it.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.roadcycling.com/news/article1187.shtml">David Cohen</a> of RoadCycling.com says that Armstrong won’t win the Tour this year because the other riders are younger and more motivated to win. I don’t buy it, they were younger last year and why weren’t they motivated to prevent him from winning his 5th or the record-breaking 6th?</p>

<p><a href="http://olntv.com">Outdoor Life Network</a> did their final “Road to the Tour” yesterday and Phil Liggett was sure favoring Armstrong and proclaiming that this year’s Discovery Team is the strongest team Lance has had in the Tour. He even said disagreed with Lance saying that <a href="http://www.t-mobile-team.com/cms/tmoteam/en/team/team2005/riders/templateId=renderInternalPage/contentID=8122/id=9158.html">Andreas Kloden</a>, a strong contender, is “riding like a sack of potatoes”. :)</p>

<p>T-Mobile has the second strongest team, in my opinion, but whether they’re all motivated to help <a href="http://www.t-mobile-team.com/cms/tmoteam/en/team/team2005/riders/templateId=renderInternalPage/contentID=8176/id=9158.html">Jan Ullrich</a> win is the question. <a href="http://www.t-mobile-team.com/cms/tmoteam/en/team/team2005/riders/templateId=renderInternalPage/contentID=8194/id=9158.html">Vinokourov</a> could be better than Ullrich. And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Basso">Ivan Basso</a> is another threat.</p>

<p>Regardless, it should be a good Tour this year!</p>
