          </h3>
            <p>Gay and I went to “Beveridge Place Pub”:http://www.beveridgeplacepub.com/ for a rare date night, only the second time we’ve left Hudson at home. We’ve driven by it for years and never felt tempted to go in, but ever since discovered that it’s a highly-regarded beer place we’ve been trying to get a chance to go. Hours before we left, I checked their web site to see what beers they have on tap (they don’t list them, unfortunately) and realized that they don’t serve food at all. Instead, they provide a set of local restaurants that will deliver to the pub. That doesn’t make for such a nice date night, but we decided to not change our plans and we went anyway. I’m glad we did.</p>

<p>I agree with the general consensus, this is a great beer bar. They have 18 taps of mostly Washington and Oregon beers. It’s a very casual place, a very English-style pub with various styles of furniture and a couple couches.</p>

<p>I was happy to find out they had three bourbon barrel-aged beers: Schooner Exact Hoppy the Woodsman (a tiny West Seattle brewery), Issaquah’s Quad Frog and “Pike’s Entire”:http://beernews.org/2008/11/pike-entire-wood-aged-stout-drops-this-monday/ (7% ABV%), a beer I’ve been looking for for a while now, so that’s what I ordered. Gay got the Schooner Exact Hoppy the Woodsman. I really liked the Pike Entire, but it was slightly too oak-flavored and not hoppy enough for me. I’d pick The Abyss over this one if I had a choice (apparently, last week they had The Abyss on tap too!).</p>

<p>We ordered pizza from Pagliacci and waited while we finished our beers. For our second round, I got Full Sail’s “Wreck the Halls”:http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/5316/7200 (6.5% ABV) winter seasonal and, to try the last of the bourbon barrel beers, I ordered the Quad Frog (13.5% ABV) for Gay. She preferred the Wreck the Halls and I preferred the Quad Frog, so we switched. I thought the Quad Frog tasted a lot like Menage-a-Frog that we got “at the Rogue brewpub in Oregon”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/01/11/drive-to-cannon-beach-oregon/ last January. It turns out that it’s in the same family, brewed by Rogue only in their Issaquah brewpub (not sure why they didn’t label it as a Rogue beer).</p>

<p>Ordering food from another restaurant for delivery to a pub is a first for me. I’m not sure I’d go there again for dinner, but it’s a great place to stop in to find a great unique craft beers.</p>

            <p>The New York Times did “a taste test of barrel-aged beers”:http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/dining/07wine.html?_r=1, which is a recent trend in brewing. See their “tasting report”:http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/dining/07wlis.html?ref=dining. I’m still trying to get my hands on Pike’s Entire bourbon barrel-aged stout, but I “have had Dogfish Head’s Burton Baton barrel-aged IPA”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/06/11/dogfish-head-burton-baton-imperial-ipa/, which is very good and I still have a few bottles left waiting for a good reason.</p>

            <p>The Seattle Times “interviewed Rick Steves”:http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2003879700_webricksteves12.html on his stance on travel as education:</p>

<p>bq. I think if the world knew what was good for it, it would establish a fund to pay for Americans all to have a free trip for six weeks, anywhere they wanted around the world upon graduation. It would be the best investment the world could ever make. Because right now an America that is threatened by, fearful of and misunderstands the rest of the world is a costly thing on this planet.</p>

<p>bq. I used to think the world was a pyramid with us on top and everybody else trying to figure it out. And I really traveled believing I could just share with people all the beauties of American culture, and I don’t believe that anymore. I like my way of living, but I don’t think that other people want to copy it.</p>

<p>bq. America, frankly, doesn’t know what war is like. We don’t have many living memories right now of what a serious war that the Europeans have experienced is. Consequently, we’ve sanitized it. And Europeans have many more powerful reminders of how war can devastate a society. Consequently they’re inclined to find alternatives to war a little more aggressively than we are.</p>

            <p>I happen to find “this blog”:http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/11/kindle-20-to-hi.html on Wired.com googling for “Kindle 2.0” and thought the photo was familiar.

          </h3>
            <p>The Seattle Post-Intelligencer “published a story”:http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/394617_shippingwoes03.html about the delivery problems with UPS and FedEx in Seattle, linking to this site, even including my lazily-titled “Seattle UPS finished sucking (for me, at least)”. Nice. But it blames the problems on the snowy and icy roads and Seattle’s government, but that’s incorrect, at least in my case. UPS and FedEx could both deliver to our house in the days before Christmas while several other packages were sitting in the UPS hub in Seattle. The problem was that the packages were not put on the trucks making deliveries in our area. In some cases, packages were taken off trucks and not put back on for a over a week! It’s not the roads or the weather, it’s a logistical problem at Seattle’s UPS hub and an inability to efficiently deal with a backlog of packages. It can’t be explained any other way.</p>

<p>The article also fails to point out that 2nd Day Air packages are not delivered any faster than Ground deliveries. In my case, 2nd Day Air “seemed to be lower-priority”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/12/30/seattle-ups-finished-sucking-for-me-at-least/ than Ground! If you read through the comments on “my original post”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/12/29/seattle-ups-sucks/ and “on the Seattle PI’s article”:http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/soundoff/comment.asp?articleID=394584, others saw the same results. I’d love to hear UPS’ explanation for that.</p>

<p>The article also mentions UPS spokespeople claiming that they have no idea how many packages are in the backlog, as if that excuses their failures. Think about that, UPS tracks every package with tracking numbers that are recorded in their computer system and can be tracked on their route around the country, but they have no way to <em>count</em> them?!? I wouldn’t have believed that even if the two customer service reps I talked to gave me counts. One said there were 60,000 packages and another said 10,000 packages an hour later. Obviously, those numbers are made up too because they didn’t deliver 50,000 packages between the two calls I made. When I questioned the discrepancy, I was told that the 10,000 figure was the last update they have – they do have counts for the backlog, apparently. So either UPS’ customer service reps are lying to customers and UPS has no way to count packages to be delivered, or the spokespeople used in this article are lying that they can’t count them.</p>
