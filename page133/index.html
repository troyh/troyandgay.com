            <p>The weatherpeople predicted snow on Wednesday and the fear of snow caused schools all over the area to preemptively cancel school. But the snow never came. It did come Thursday morning. We woke up to about a half-inch of snow and at 8:30am it started snowing and hasn’t stopped by 1pm. We have about 4 inches here on Vashon.</p>

<p>Vashon schools were closed yesterday but not today. Kids had to go to school this morning only to be sent home at 10:30am for elementary and 12:30pm for middle and high school. Someone in the “Vashon school district”:http://www.vashonsd.org/ needs to spend a little more time looking out the window and less time listening to fortune-tellers on TV.</p>

            <p>The Steelers clinched their division yesterday beating the Ravens 13-9 by keeping the Ravens to only 202 yards (no team has gained 300 yards this year) and no touchdowns. The Steelers prove that a good defense is more important than a good offense. If they beat the Titans next week and both either lose or win the last week, they will be the #1 seed in the AFC.</p>

            <p>It started snowing Saturday night while we were at Megan &amp; Jon’s Christmas Party. We left at 9:30pm and ran into some slick roads on Vashon when we got home.</p>

<p>We got about 1.5 inches. It was in the 20s all day Sunday and the forecast is for 20s all week and even more snow on Wednesday. It’s rarely this cold in Seattle so it’s fun for a little while, but it reminds me too much of the East Coast weather.</p>
