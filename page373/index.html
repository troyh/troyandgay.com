It is so darn cute you can’t help but talk to it and pat it and make it’s little screen move up and down anthropomorphically.  I thought for sure we’d have one of these days after they were first released, but it didn’t make sense then.</p>

              <p>I finished the new Harry Potter the weekend before last in an all Sunday marathon session.  I liked it quite a lot but the 3rd remains my favorite.  I am thoroughly charmed by Harry, and Rowlings ability to rejuvenate young readers.  Remarkably I returned to <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/06/001514.php">The Clinton Wars</a> and will finish it tonight.  I am also now reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735712018/recipezaar-20"><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/dws100.gif" alt="dws100.gif" />Designing with Web Standards</a> online using <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">O’Reilly’s Safari bookshelf</a> (you pay $20/month and can read 5 technical books).  It is a great book on web standards, but it is perfect to read online because he links to so many sites and they are real links online and on paper, well, you have retype them. (click the pic to check it out at Amazon, more comments later).</p>

              <p><a href="http://recipezaar.com">Our database server</a> flipped out for a few minutes last night at 11p.  Nothing like getting ready for bed and thinking you need to be getting ready to hop a ferry and go downtown to reboot a server at midnight.  Granted, living on an island makes anything, esp. late night activities, more complicated, but businesses that never close can be a real drag.</p>

              <p>Well it has taken me til Thursday to report on the weekend.  Vashon Island’s big festival celebrates strawberries – which are no longer grown here.  We had a big barbecue Friday night with Jen, Nicki, Traci, Eric &amp; Steve that culminated in peach cobbler and a midnight game of 12 o’Clock the Ghosts are Out.  Nothing like playing hide and seek in your front yard in your thirties.  Saturday morning I ran a 10k (95th out of 110!) and Traci &amp; Eric ran the 5k.  Megan &amp; Jon, Stephanie &amp; Matt, and Mark &amp; Lee joined us on the island for the parade, one of those cute rural America sort of things (antique tractors were the best part).  We worked the beer garden for hours and rode carnival rides.  It was a really, really fun time and a tradition I hope holds.  Though the raspberries were better if you ask me.</p>

              <p>So <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/text/2003/jul/17/071708371.html">who did Tenet name</a> as the White Houser responsible for the misleading uranium claim in the State of the Union Address? My money is on either Rumsfeld or Wolfowitz. Both of those guys strike me as guys who truly believe the ends justify the means.</p>
