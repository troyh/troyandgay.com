          <p>Comcast is <em>still</em> flakey. It generally works, but some sites are inaccessible. And intermittently. Must be a bad router or two somewhere down the line.</p>

          <p>The only statistic that I need to see to prove to myself that most Americans have turned their brains off: Budweiser has 52.1% of the beer market.</p>

          <p>So you’ve heard the scary stat that 22% of American’s believe Iraq actually <em>used</em> WMD in the war – no wonder we can’t find them, they done used ‘em all up.  <a href="http://www.thismodernworld.com/weblog/mtarchives/week_2003_06_15.html#000779">More Harper’s Bazaar-type statistics plucked from PollingReport.com by Tom Tomorrow</a>:</p>

<p>56% think in war, the media should support the government over questioning it
40% believe the media was biased in favor of Bill Clinton
33% believe a wife should “submit herself graciously” to a husband
30% say the Bible is the “actual word of God” to be taken literally
20% approve of the how the Catholic Church handles pedophilia
20% believe that the killing of civilians in Vietnam was “relatively rare”
3% wanted to see the questions on “Millionaire” become less difficult</p>

          <p>I remember when we thought the browser would basically replace the OS.  (I use a great browser on the Mac so this doesn’t really apply to me, but) <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/index-beta.php">Google seems to be giving the browser a competitor</a> – specifically a new pop-up blocker and “blog this!” buttons.</p>
