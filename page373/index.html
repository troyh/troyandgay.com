          <p>Today is the last day of the first half of the year. One of my New Year’s resolutions was to ride my bike 4 times a week and to do the “long version” of the ride half the time. Well, I should easily accomplish the 4 times a week part, but I have yet to ride the longer route this year. But I think I’m up for it strength-wise (there’s a <em>long</em> climb on it), if I could just spare the time it’ll take to do the longer route.</p>

          <p>Last week, Apple introduced <a href="http://apple.com/isight">iSight</a>. I was interested, but not seriously because I’ve tried video conferencing before and was always disappointed. But on Saturday, my niece, who lives on the other side of the country, and I got iChat audio working. We could talk over the internet (for free!) and the sound quality was amazing. So my brother and I made a deal to both get iSights so we could video conference. He ran to his local Apple store that night and got his. And we video conferenced today and the video quality is also amazing. My iSight will be here Tuesday.</p>

<p>How does Apple do it? For years, the industry languished with lousy quality. But overnight, Apple made it real.</p>

          <p>We almost got kicked out of our local pub on Friday night with our friends Heather &amp; Larry &amp; Ron the accupressurist due to the drunk beligerance of another…well, Larry’s tumble off of a bar stool onto the floor probably didn’t impress the staff either, but we found it hilarious.  I sort of wish we had been 86-ed just because with the number of professional drinkers that frequent Bishop’s it would have been quite a badge of honor.  Saturday Troy and I had an amazing 4 hour conversation about a business idea, well several actually – it is stuff like that which reminds me that I have the smartest boyfriend in the world.  Followed by a fantastic dinner (<a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/recipe/getrecipe.zsp?id=41889">ribs</a>, <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/recipe/getrecipe.zsp?id=14433">corn</a>, and <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/search/getrecipe.zsp?id=64861">fresh cherry pie</a> that did NOT set) with our friend Mark Weeks, catching up on his life and falling more in love with his boyfriend Lee, even though he is still in London.  Highlight: Mark had his laptop so we could see all of his recent photos.  What a great way to look at pictures!</p>

          <p><em>Says Alan Cohen, a V.P. of Airespace, a new Wi-Fi provider: “If I can operate Google, I can find anything. And with wireless, it means I will be able to find anything, anywhere, anytime. Which is why I say that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/29/opinion/29FRIE.html">Google, combined with Wi-Fi, is a little bit like God. God is wireless, God is everywhere and God sees and knows everything</a>. Throughout history, people connected to God without wires. Now, for many questions in the world, you ask Google, and increasingly, you can do it without wires, too.</em> I’ve been contemplating a lot how much the world has changed since I’ve been in it and how different it will be for my own kids.  Access to information through the internet is easily one of the most amazing thing…</p>

          <p>Troy and I joked about starting an internet porn business instead of recipes, just because it was such a clear money-maker.  If only we’d realized there was a great business just a couple of doors down: online personal ads/dating.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/29/national/29DATE.html">This article in the NYTimes</a> (free registration required) talks about how mainstream it has become.  While Match.com makes $240,000,000/year (!) and clearly network effects matter (like ebay you go to the site that has the most people on it, so the bigger you get the bigger you get), in the case of dating they key is finding other people like you so there is plenty of room for niche sites like JDate.com for Jewish Singles, etc.</p>
