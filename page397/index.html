              <p>It’s becoming clear that the Iraq war was not about WMD and certainly not about liberating the Iraqi people. It was about ridding the world of a horrible dictator and someone who attempted to assassinate an ex-President. It just goes to show that anyone who trusts any political party wholesale, Democrat or Republican or whatever, will eventually be shown to be a fool. I’d like to go back to the days when our President lied about his personal life rather than his professional life. At least that didn’t risk the safety of the entire US population.</p>

<p>I fear the Bush Administration set the state of US foreign policy back 30 years.</p>

              <p><a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2083760/">Wither the Weapons?</a>.  We were sold the Iraq war on the basis that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.  So where are they?  Either they won’t be found because they don’t exist (not since 95 when we destroyed them the last time around) or because, as some are incredulously arguing now, the Iraqis destroyed them.  The latter proves only the threat of war was necessary to get Saddam to disarm; while the former proves we either shouldn’t have gone to war, or the American people were persuaded on a lie.  If the peace movement wants to succeed in the future, their greatest task is ahead of them now.  DO NOT SHUT UP UNTIL THE WEAPONS ARE FOUND.</p>

              <p>Yep, we did have an earthquake. <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/recenteqsUS/Quakes/uw05300350.htm">A 3.4 near Port Orchard, WA</a>. Lots of <a href="http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/shake/STORE/X5300350/ciim_stats_1.html">reports</a> already, 6 even from Vashon. This is the 4th quake I’ve felt since living in Seattle: 2 tiny (including this one), 1 small and 1 HUGE.</p>
