              <p>I stumbled on to “The Decemberists”:http://www.decemberists.com/ last night on PBS in a replay of Austin City Limits. They played <em>Yankee Bayonet</em> which features “Laura Veirs”:http://www.lauraveirs.com/ on vocals, which I like. And the second band on ACL was “Explosions in the Sky”:http://www.explosionsinthesky.com/, which is an instrumental band similar to “Tortoise”:http://www.trts.com/site.html or “Mogwai”:http://www.mogwai.co.uk/, two other bands I like. I bought both albums on iTunes.</p>

<p>Note “the 9/11 conspiracy theories”:http://www.blacktable.com/mayle050126.htm involving Explosions in the Sky:</p>

<p>bq. Explosions in the Sky released its album on September 10, 2001 and the next day, on September 11th, the skyline above Manhattan exploded in fire as Islamic terrorists crashed airplanes into the World Trade Center. Not only did the band’s name prefigure the attacks, but so did the album’s elegiac art work of angels tracing empyrean paths to a fiery orange heaven. And the creepiest detail of all is that the record had a track that was titled, unbelievably, “This Plane Will Crash Tomorrow,” which was subsequently removed from the album.</p>

<p>“Totally untrue”:http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2002/11/15/179685, the album was released on August 27, 2001 or September 4, 2001, depending on who you ask, and never contained any such song title.</p>

<p>No reviews of the albums yet, just one listen each so far. The only other albums I’ve bought this year are R.E.M.’s <em>Accelerate</em> (blah) and The Magnetic Fields’ <em>Distortion</em> (also blah). 2008 has been pretty lousy for music. Good thing the new Coldplay is due out next month, now that’s sure to be good stuff. ;)</p>

<p>I’m really tempted to get an “Amazon Kindle”:http://amazon.com/kindle lately. When it first came out I thought it was expensive and pretty crappy and its “reviews”:http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2007/11/19/amazon-kindle-ebook-1.html confirmed that. And there was very little content I wanted to read on it (not a big fan of best-seller fiction). And it’s not color, all the web sites and magazines I read that I could get on it are in color, so black and white is a step backwards. E-Ink makes “a color version”:http://www.eink.com/press/releases/pr86.html, why not give customers a color option? But more and more books that I’ve bought or are considering reading are available on Kindle now and, with all the traveling we’ve been doing, not having to pick just two books to take with me would be convenient enough for me to put up with all its flaws.</p>

<p>I’ve decided to wait for “version 2.0”:http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/19/enough-about-kindle-10-what-about-kindle-20/ thinking it’ll fix a lot of the problems that people have discovered in 1.0, such as “having to put a pad on the case”:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B000FI73MA/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_all to keep it from holding a button down, draining the battery. I’m also hoping that Apple comes out with an e-book reader – they know how to make great hardware. All they have to do is give me a bigger iPhone and add books to the iTunes store. How hard can that be for them?</p>

              <p>It’s Gay’s second Mother’s Day. Havana and I let her sleep in a little this morning while we made breakfast. I’m taking care of Havana <em>all</em> day today, which I will be doing every 365¼ days – that kind of tireless dedication is what it takes to be a good husband and father.</p>

<p>Havana in her crib right now for her morning nap:</p>

<p>(It’s blurry because she’s learned to fiddle with the focus)</p>

<p>Havana talked to her grandparents (my parents) on Skype, which means she stares at the screen and walks around and they talk to her. Havana will always grow up with the video phones that were promised to my generation, and she won’t think anything of it. Tekmology! I’m making Gay dinner tonight… I’m making her “Pastitsio”:http://www.recipezaar.com/59733, which is the most complex thing I can make:</p>
