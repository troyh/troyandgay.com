              <p>Hmmm…. by my calculations, Gay scores 5 merits and 7 demerits for a total of -2 on the “Wife’s Marital Rating Scale”:http://www.apa.org/monitor/2008/05/marriage.html used by a respected marriage counselor in 1939.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Not only does she fail to sew on buttons or darn socks <em>regularly</em>, I have no evidence she has ever darned a single sock. Demerit! I’m sure that if she actually wore hose, the seams would be often crooked, but since she doesn’t wear them, she skated by on that one. And she has worn red nail polish before, but since it’s not a regular thing and because I’m a merciful husband, I didn’t mark her down for that. The marriage counselor didn’t even expect a score of less than 0, he’d be amazed at what I have to put up with.</p>

<p>It’s interesting that “Can carry on an interesting conversation” and “Good sense of humor” are only worth 1 merit point. A wife with those qualities  whose only flaw is being late for appointments would score a -3. I’m surprised “Doesn’t complain when husband disciplines her” isn’t on the list of merits.</p>

<p>It’s a man’s world, eh?  I’d love to see the Husband’s Chart.</p>

              <p>How do you know that Intelligent Design is not science? “George W. Bush understands it”:http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/02/AR2005080201686.html.</p>

<p>If you want to see evidence that the US actually can make the correct decisions, and overwhelmingly so, in the courts, in public opinion and in education, watch “Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial”:http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Judgment_Day_Intelligent_Design_on_Trial/70086394?trkid=226870. It’ll restore your belief that America is not full of ignorant hillbillies.</p>

<p>Although for Seattle residents, you’ll be embarrassed that a “think tank” on Intelligent Design, “the Discovery Institute”:http://www.discovery.org, is headquartered in Seattle. Even the Catholic Church, hardly the bastion of scientific understanding, started accepting Evolution as far back as the 1950s – 30 years <em>before</em> they accepted that the Earth revolves around the Sun! Yet there are some Americans who believe don’t believe in Evolution cuz da bible tells ‘em so.</p>

              <p>I stumbled on to “The Decemberists”:http://www.decemberists.com/ last night on PBS in a replay of Austin City Limits. They played <em>Yankee Bayonet</em> which features “Laura Veirs”:http://www.lauraveirs.com/ on vocals, which I like. And the second band on ACL was “Explosions in the Sky”:http://www.explosionsinthesky.com/, which is an instrumental band similar to “Tortoise”:http://www.trts.com/site.html or “Mogwai”:http://www.mogwai.co.uk/, two other bands I like. I bought both albums on iTunes.</p>

<p>Note “the 9/11 conspiracy theories”:http://www.blacktable.com/mayle050126.htm involving Explosions in the Sky:</p>

<p>bq. Explosions in the Sky released its album on September 10, 2001 and the next day, on September 11th, the skyline above Manhattan exploded in fire as Islamic terrorists crashed airplanes into the World Trade Center. Not only did the band’s name prefigure the attacks, but so did the album’s elegiac art work of angels tracing empyrean paths to a fiery orange heaven. And the creepiest detail of all is that the record had a track that was titled, unbelievably, “This Plane Will Crash Tomorrow,” which was subsequently removed from the album.</p>

<p>“Totally untrue”:http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2002/11/15/179685, the album was released on August 27, 2001 or September 4, 2001, depending on who you ask, and never contained any such song title.</p>

<p>No reviews of the albums yet, just one listen each so far. The only other albums I’ve bought this year are R.E.M.’s <em>Accelerate</em> (blah) and The Magnetic Fields’ <em>Distortion</em> (also blah). 2008 has been pretty lousy for music. Good thing the new Coldplay is due out next month, now that’s sure to be good stuff. ;)</p>
