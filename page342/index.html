            <p><a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> is up to <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=recipezaar.com">8,800</a> on <a href="http://www.alexa.com">Alexa</a>’s ranking system. That means there are only 8,799 sites that are bigger in traffic.</p>

<p>It’s only one system for ranking sites and isn’t always the same as what we see internally, but it’s as good a barometer as any. But the most interesting thing is that our biggest competitors (<a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=allrecipes.com">AllRecipes</a>, <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=epicurious.com">Epicurious</a>, <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=foodtv.com">FoodTV</a>), with millions of dollars in funding and marketing, are continuing to fall while Recipezaar continues to rise. I remember when they were hundreds of times bigger than us, now they’re just 3-4 times bigger. I like the trend.</p>

            <p>My mom said that my dad is still doing well; even a back ache that he had is gone (what back ache? My dad never mentions any health-related issues, thinks it’s a sign of weakness or something). His stitches (staples, actually) are going to be removed on Friday.</p>

            <p>Now that <a href="/archives/2003/09/001696.php#001696">we’re engaged</a>, the planning begins: a date, catering, invitations, etc. It’ll be sometime next summer and we will probably have it at our house. Other than that, nothing yet. But we’ve already found <a href="http://citizenrob.blogspot.com/">a Seattle printer</a> who won’t be printing our invitations.</p>

            <p>My dad came home from the hospital today and we talked to him on the phone (and also gave them <a href="/archives/2003/09/001696.php#001696">the big news</a>). He sounded very alert, moreso than before I think. I don’t know if that’s because of the operation, but he does say that he has an easier time walking already (the biggest symptom of hydrocephalus is trouble walking) and he says that his head is “more clear”. He’s still sore from the operation and can’t do anything strenuous for 30 days but it’s all very encouraging. This week should be very interesting, as the first week tends to show great improvement after the shunt surgery.</p>

<p>My sister flew from Virginia to Florida this morning to spend the week with them and help out.</p>
