          <p>My kids mistook my coffee for beer this morning. They know beers are brown and black, not urine-yellow – I’m a good influence despite their thinking I might be drinking beer for breakfast…</p>

<p>Now to show them that <a href="http://mobile.slate.com/articles/life/drink/2012/03/don_t_believe_coors_and_budweiser_colder_isn_t_better_.html">beer should not be cold</a>.</p>

          <p>Election day is coming near
You get to pick the one you fear
Mondale, Hart or Jessie J.
They won’t stick to what they say
Sorry Ron it’s time to go
Back to acting with Bonzo</p>

<p>Who you pick, it makes no matter
We eat their shit and they get fatter
He gets to live in the White House
With his dog, his cat and spouse</p>

<p>He’ll take chauffered limos
Go cruising through the ghettos
He’ll state his mind with double think
Because his ideas really stink</p>

<p>Election day is coming near
You get to pick the one you fear
Mondale, Hart or Jessie J.
They won’t stick to what they say
Sorry Ron it’s time to go
Back to acting with Bonzo!</p>

          <p>There’s no way “The Artist” is a good movie. Black and white and silent with a lousy score. They invented color and sound because movies without them sucked. That hasn’t changed, but make a movie about how wonderful Hollywood is and Hollywood will reward you. </p>

<p>Hey Scorsese, it turns out you don’t need to put such effort into movies. Make a movie about Angelina Jolie’s struggle with anorexia if you want an Oscar.</p>
