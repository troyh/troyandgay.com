              <p>You can download “The Rake’s Song”:http://links.emi.com/9j7u7q9kq2ol7o from “The Decemberists”:http://decemberists.com/ new album due out March 24. You can watch the video (and see his face with too much white makeup) for <a href="http://www.itsmorrisseysworld.com/">Morrissey</a>’s new single “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7_Nps1WhFQ">I’m Throwing My Arms Around Paris</a>” from the album due out February 16. And you can listen to <a href="http://www.u2.com/">U2</a>’s new single, “<a href="http://goyb.u2.com/">Get On Your Boots</a>” (sounds a little like <a href="&lt;a href=">Achtung Baby</a>) from their new album due out March 3.</p>

<p>If the albums are done, why do I have to wait to buy them? Years ago it took time to manufacture the plastic discs, but not anymore. Why the artificial delay to start accepting money?!?</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>The “latest chapter”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/01/23/almost-the-end-of-recipezaar/ of the Scripps/Recipezaar debacle brought out a group of people I had forgotten about. I just had a great idea, though… someone should make a documentary movie about these people! The best documentaries are the ones about real people leading bizarre lives and these people fit the bill and then some.</p>

<p>Here’s the premise…</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>It’s a group of adult people who get together with a tiny number of like-minded people and attack other people on the internet. That in itself isn’t that new, but what makes them so bizarre is that they do it for years with mostly the same people day and night. It’s essentially a 24x7 365 days a year war, or set of wars. It’s like they’re playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons but with real people on the internet. Some of the groups I’ve seen are well into their 7th year of doing this, and I’d bet even longer before they ever came to my attention. Could it be 10 or 15 years?</p>

<p>We were exposed to it on Recipezaar because it had a large number of people participating in forums and there was a catch-all forum where  you could talk about anything you wanted, not just cooking. This group broke up into warring sects or the sects existed before and came to Recipezaar where they saw a lot of innocents. They recruit new members, they pick unsuspecting and gullible people and befriend them to convince them to do things they wouldn’t normally do, they have “sentries” who watch their enemies’ camps (bulletin boards) around the clock and report on what they read, they have “spies” that infiltrate other groups for ammunition and I’m sure tons of other extreme things we never saw.</p>

<p>It’s like a religious military but everything’s done by forum posts, email and IM rather than guns and bombs. Each group has a name, a single cult-like leader who has the final say in who is in the group and who has to be kicked out, who the new targets are and why, they make big speeches to rally their followers, there’s coup d’etats, back-stabbing and everything else you see in a soap opera or war novel.</p>

<p>The issues they battle over are things you’d expect like religion and politics and friendships but also on things you wouldn’t expect: people’s choice of pet, the TV shows and movies they like, the recipes they like (that’s probably Recipezaar-specific) and I’m sure tons of other things that normal people don’t even notice. No issue is too small to go to war over.</p>

<p>I think it’s interesting because the internet really makes them possible. I guess these types existed before the internet, but they were just the crazy aunt or uncle in families or the person down the street who peered out the window and gossiped about everyone and parents told their kids to avoid. But thanks to the internet, they’re worldwide so they have a huge number of people to fight with, to become paranoid about, etc.</p>

<p>I also wonder if they only exist on the internet or if they have wars with their mailman, their neighbors, the cashier at their local grocery store, their spouses and children, etc. In other words, are they the same people as the old crazies pre-internet or are they a new breed focused solely on the internet?</p>

<p>Is it one big long war or is it a series of small battles? Is there scoring and points involved? How do you decide who wins? How do their families get involved? Do their families know and support them or is it hidden from their families? Do they prepare their children to continue the war after they’re gone? Do they teach their children their tactics so they can become great internet warriors one day? Do they have jobs and, if so, does it interfere with their job or career? Does it help them in their job or career? Are they educated, uneducated or a mix? There’s no end to the questions and a documentary could answer them all.</p>

<p>It’s a fascinating sociology and psychological study and it’d be an amazing documentary. Someone’s gotta do it.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Just three months after we sold Recipezaar to Scripps Networks Gay and I quit. We did not get along with Deanna Brown, our boss, and she made it clear that she did not want to hear from us at all on any topic. She put a yes-woman in between us and her and told everyone else to humor us but to ignore us. Life’s too short to put up with incompetence, especially when they’re your boss, so we quit in October 2007. The three people we had hired and brought into Scripps, Kathy, Liza and Debbie stayed at Scripps. In retrospect, I’m sure we would have been fired or, at least, strongly encouraged to leave, had we not quit on our own.</p>

<p>Last Thursday we found out that Kathy was layed-off.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>When we got her email that she her last day was January 30, we assumed she quit. We were shocked to find out that they fired her! Kathy ran Recipezaar day-to-day and was a critical part of the site – she processed all the recipes which we never got to make completely trivial, it was still a manual job to fix the things people enter into recipes to make them suitable for the site. She managed and communicated with the community so she had a handle on what was going on. She filtered complaints and bug reports and kept us aware of what needed to be fixed or changed. Without Kathy, Recipezaar would stop dead in its tracks.</p>

<p>Scripps assumed that she was just a customer service rep and they’ve got tons of those, so what value is Kathy? Sure, someone could have been trained to replace Kathy, but Scripps didn’t even try that. In the 18 months while she worked there, Kathy was never asked to train anyone. Scripps is clueless about how the site runs.</p>

<p>The next day we found out that Debbie was fired too. I can’t say we were surprised by this and I don’t think she was either. Debbie was over-over-over-qualified for her job. We hired her in a Usability and User Experience position and Scripps turned her into a Photoshop-jockey, creating ads and adjusting photographs. This is like asking an astronaut to ride a tricycle. Scripps is lousy with Photoshop nerds and those people work for peanuts, so it only took Scripps 18 months to realize she was overpaid. Scripps has no desire for a User Experience designer even if they knew what it was.</p>

<p>The unorganized way Scripps is run never failed to surprise us, but what business person doesn’t know that lay-offs should happen at once, not over several days? Scripps doesn’t. They did lay-offs on Thursday and then Friday leaving the remaining employees to wonder over the weekend if they’d have a job on Monday. It’s a great way to destroy morale at your company.</p>

<p>So that leaves just Liza of the five of us that worked at Recipezaar.</p>

<p>If it wasn’t inexplicable enough, Recipezaar is the only site at Scripps that is meeting (and surpassing) its goals for traffic and revenue. Every other site they own is falling short of their goals. Recipezaar is also incredibly profitable. It had a 50% profit margin when we ran it. If Scripps did <em>anything</em> right selling ads with their massive ad sales department for both TV and online, the profit margin must be 80% or more. Why lay-off two-thirds of the staff of a staff of three when those three people are generating lots of revenue and profit?!? Someone at Scripps is very bad at math (and logic). I could name five people that I worked with at Scripps in the short time I was there that were complete dead weight. For example, they have a person whose sole job is to manage the cellular phone contract for the company, a person who manages a staff of 2 in Receiving (of the Shipping and Receiving Department), and a person who is a glorified DayTimer – she schedules meetings. Most of their IT staff is weak and their developers are downright lazy.</p>

<p>The core problem at Scripps with respect to Recipezaar is that they think of it as a magazine that just needs regurgitated cover stories. We suspected this was true before we sold the company to Scripps, just as we were of every company that wanted to buy it in the previous years. Recipezaar is a software company; the site is software that has to be maintained and enhanced constantly. We correctly gauged every other suitor as a company that doesn’t understand software development so we always refused to sell it. But Scripps repeatedly insisted that they understood that Recipezaar was different and, more importantly, that they wanted more interactive sites like Recipezaar and that they wanted us to help makeover FoodNetwork.com and HGTV.com into more engaging and interactive sites. John Lansing, the President of the company, sat at our dinner table with us and talked at length about this understanding and desire for good software developers. Our experience with Recipezaar and at Microsoft was appealing to them.</p>

<p>If you can’t believe the President of the company, who can you believe? I tend to think he was being honest. Unfortunately, they hired Deanna Brown in the meantime to run the web sites and she never got (or more likely, understood) the memo. Deanna thinks a cashmere sweater is software. Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe we were lied to to convince us to sell it to them. But I can’t imagine why they would think that is a good idea. Why would anyone take something on that required work that they didn’t understand how to do had no intention of learning?</p>

<p>If Liza doesn’t pick up all of Kathy’s job, I don’t see how new recipes and reviews are going to be added to the site after January 30, let alone all the communication with the community. I already know that Scripps doesn’t care to fix bugs and only begrudgingly fixes performance problems. The site can’t grow without software fixes and improvements and a constant flow of recipes, reviews and photos. Like all businesses, if it’s not growing, it’s dying.</p>

<p>It’s almost the end of an era in my life.</p>

<p><strong>Clarification:</strong> This post is not Recipezaar’s obituary. T&amp;G.com is my personal site where I write about things that matter to me in my life. Please don’t read into anything I write as anything more than my personal thoughts. I called it “(Almost) The End” because, to me, it is almost the end of Recipezaar as I know it. In my Recipezaar book, quitting was the end of a chapter, the crazy half-assed redesign that we fought against was the end of a chapter and Kathy and Debbie leaving is the end of a chapter. That book is almost over. Liza leaving will be the final chapter. The site could last 30 more years but that book would be a sequel that has nothing to do with me. :)</p>
