            <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/27140923/"><img src="http://photos21.flickr.com/27140923_da3d2a68bb_m.jpg" alt="Lunch in Briancon" /></a>We finally got home from our trip to France last night at 6pm. We were upgraded to business class on the flight from London to Seattle. Business class on British Airways means you get the <a href="http://www.britishairways.com/travel/cwexp/public/en_us">most comfortable seats</a> I’ve ever flown in – you can lay completely flat and you get a little private “cocoon” and you’re served as much wine as you can drink. After watching three movies, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fever_pitch/">Fever Pitch</a> (so-so), <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/millions/">Millions</a> (very good) and <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hitch/">Hitch</a> (dumb), we were landing in Seattle. I could fly like that all the time!</p>

<p>It’s great to be home! After being away for so long (3 weeks) home feels a little new to us again. Jon &amp; Megan picked us up at the ferry dock and we had dinner and beers waiting til we could go to sleep to wake up at a reasonable hour to minimize our jet lag.</p>

<p>I’ll write a more detailed entry about the trip’s highlights soon. But we didn’t meet Lance (or Sheryl Crow) but I did get Johan Bruyneel’s autograph and I got a great Tour souvenir, driving through the Alps was amazing, the French countryside is beautiful, the south of France is as great as the Mediterranean always is, the French people were surprisingly laid-back and friendly, the food was the best food I’ve ever had on vacation, and we had no bad cheese or wine.</p>

<p>I’ve posted <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/sets/658007/">some photos</a> at Flickr but most are private photos only visible by family and friends. If you’re a friend or family member who hasn’t yet been given access to the photos, email us and let us know.</p>

          </h3>
            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/maryandlinda.jpg" alt="mary and linda" />Our neighbor Mary married us, and now she and her partner Linda (on the right) are looking to adopt.  They put up <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~marinmartinez/">their adoption website</a>, which tells all about them. Birth mothers can browse potential adoptive families, and select the one they want their babies to go to.  Things have changed greatly (and for the better) since I was adopted.</p>

<p>Mary &amp; Linda are wonderful people and fabulous neighbors.  Troy and I have had long conversations with Mary about love and marriage and family, for her to feel comfortable endorsing our own union last year, so I know a lot more about them than you do most people you share a street with and an occasional party invitation.  Any baby would be super lucky to be a part of their lives, so if you know of anyone who might not be in the right situation for a child now, I encourage you to think about them.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

            <p>Our friends the Bennedsens recently went digging Geoducks [GOO-EEE-DUCKS].  Not an easy enterprise, because they live several FEET deep and are fast diggers, but always a very funny one.  <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/r/212/427/ls=p">Geoducks do make the best clam chowder</a>

            <a class="post-link" href="/2005/06/27/im-named-after-football-legend-gale-sayers.html">I'm named after football legend Gale Sayers</a>
          </h3>
            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/hofsayers.jpg" alt="gale sayers" />The story I had always told of my name is wrong: I had thought my mom adapted the Scottish name “Gaelen” into “Gay Lynn” after discovering the name while browsing magazines at the dentist’s office.  I had always imagined it was some swashbuckling swordsman, Gaelen, a dragon-slayer perhaps, whose story was told in some glamour magazine.  I imagined a real hero’s tale, accompanied by some type of captivating historical illustration.  His lyrical name repeated over and over in the story, echoing even in the last line of story…</p>

<p>A couple of years ago the topic came up at dinner with my mom and Troy.  Turns out, Gaelen was a football player whom my mom remembered as dying young from cancer, in a Reader’s Digest story she flipped through at the beauty parlor.</p>

<p>I decided to look up my namesake on the internet recently and there were no Gaelens in the NFL.  After a little research by both mom and me, it turns out I’m named for <a href="http://sayers.com/sayers_meetgale.html">Gale Sayers</a>!  Gale’s autobiography, “I Am Third,” came out right around when I was born and was subsequently turned into the movie “Brian’s Song”.  It was his roommate Brian Piccolo who died of cancer.  Gale is still alive and a successful business man in Chicago, coincidentally in computer software.</p>

<p>Is it strange to know you are named after a football player? Yes, especially if you a a girl.  At least I was named after a Hall of Famer, whom Mike Ditka said is the best player he’s ever seen, and who still holds the record for the most TDs in a game (6 v. the 49ers).  I just wish I would have known it when I saw “Brian’s Song” in 8th grade.</p>

<p>Mom said she liked the name because she thought it would work well if the adoption agency came through with either a boy or a girl. Troy’s not sure if he is remembering this wrong, but he remembers seeing Gale Sayers as a walk-on in a “Brady Bunch” episode where he explained that kids made fun of his name, because it was a girl’s name.  So I guess that is something else Gale Sayers and I have in common, though I suspect that a boy Gale Gilmore or Gay Gilmore would have been teased more than a girl Gay Gilmore, but for completely different reasons.  That said, I think boy Gale Gilmore could have better leveraged being named for Gale Sayers.</p>

<p>Are you named for someone?</p>

            <p>Our friend <a href="http://mikeandkiernan.blogspot.com/2005/06/we-have-some-sad-news-last-tuesday.html">Kiernan’s father passed away</a> last week.  Coincidentally, <a href="http://www.insertcardfully.com/2005/05/play_a_game_of_.html">Elizabeth’s father died last month</a>.  Perhaps our blogroll is cursed.  Perhaps people just die, when you least and most expect it.</p>
