            <p>Powell said the huge explosion in North Korea is “not a nuclear test”:http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;e=2&amp;u=/ap/20040912/ap_on_re_as/nkorea_explosion. That confused me, I thought for sure they’d use this to prove that North Korea is a threat. Why would they quickly work to diminish fears that would certainly help Bush’s re-election?</p>

<p>Maybe “Richard Reeves”:http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/ucrr/20040912/cm_ucrr/whatifwehadnotgoneintoiraq has the answer: <em>Among the many people quoted in the Atlantic is Jeffrey Record, a professor of strategy at the Army War College, who summed up a good deal of the thinking in Washington now: “Are we better off in basic security than before we invaded Iraq? The answer is no. An unnecessary war has consumed American Army and other ground resources, to the point where we have nothing left in the cupboard for another contingency – for instance, should the North Koreans decide that with the Americans completely absorbed in Iraq, now is the time to do something.”</em></p>

            <p>For the first time, Microsoft has stated in their SEC filing that “Linux servers outpaced Microsoft’s for the first time in terms of growth percentage.”:http://money.cnn.com/2004/09/09/technology/techinvestor/hellweg/  And, significantly, linux installations are under-reported since many linux servers are bought without an OS – we have ~20 (I’ve stopped counting) linux servers and none register as linux servers since they were all purchased without an OS and we installed the OS ourselves.</p>

            <p>Gay was interviewed by “Red Herring”:http://www.redherring.com and the article, “Gourmet geek”:http://www.redherring.com/article.aspx?a=10846&amp;hed=Better+than+you%3a+Gourmet+geek, is up now. :)</p>

<p>I think they chose a bad photo, but Gay doesn’t like her photos wear she wears glasses, although I do. A “fluff” piece, but if someone told me a few years ago that either one of us would be in Red Herring, ….</p>
