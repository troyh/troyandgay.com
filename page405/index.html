              <p>The dishonesty cited in this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/15/technology/15SOFT.html?pagewanted=1&amp;th">NYT article</a> and the recent <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoft/134731106_iloo14.html">lying about the iLoo</a> by Microsoft gets under my skin. I’m not so naive as to believe corporations are altruistic, but I do expect them to not be outright liars, especially when their marketing budget used to push the lies exceeds the GDP of many countries.</p>

<p>The Microsoft employees posing as non-Microsoft employees at conferences reminds me of the time I went to a Netscape conference in 1997 as a Microsoft employee. I attended a talk about Netscape’s mail server product with another Microsoft employee and during the Q&amp;A period, my coworker took off his badge (that said “Microsoft” on it), asked me to take mine off, and then he got up and asked a question intended to imply to the audience that Netscape was lying about their product. He knew and I knew that Netscape wasn’t lying, but the audience probably was less sure. I’m not purporting that this is the reason Netscape died as a company, but it was one of the many things I was involved with at Microsoft that just left a bad taste in my mouth.</p>

Robotcop will allow us to “trap” misbehaving web crawlers and block them from using the site. Recipezaar is different in that it contains millions (billions?) of pages that you can browse through, all dynamically-generated from a database. So irresponsible (meaning they ignore our <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/robots.html">robots.txt</a> file) web crawlers stupidly spend weeks crawling the site which causes an unnecessary load on the site, which is problematic for us in a number of ways. It’ll be interesting to see how well Robotcop works.</p>

              <p>Our friends John and Deborah gave us an elegant bird feeder for New Year’s.  It took about 3 months to buy seed, and then only a month to finally get it hung on a tree.  So far no customers though.  We just don’t know how to get the word out in the bird community…</p>

Wow, the US may not have the world’s ugliest currency for long. Why the US is spending so much money to keep ahead of counterfeiters is beyond me, though. We should be moving to e-cash. I already have, I rarely have cash in my wallet. Does the US <em>still</em> prefer cash??</p>

              <p>Spent a few hours on Sunday cleaning the decks and weeding the back yard as Troy mowed.  I don’t know what it is about the soil out here, but the dandelions are HUGE.  Flower/seed stems are at least a foot tall and the plants (not weeds, full-on plants) are more than a foot in diameter.  Satisfying to kill.</p>
