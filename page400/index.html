              <p>Our friends Annie (&amp; Noke) are having their second baby, and so <a href="http://about.nordstrom.com/aboutus/investor/contact_info.asp">Stephanie</a> and I threw her a baby shower on Sunday.  I spent Saturday night at Steph’s so we could shop, cook and generally dish before the party.  We even dyed each other’s hair – how’s that for super-girlie?!  The brunch was very yummy, the baby got lots of adorable presents and Steph and I got to witness the chaos that children bring.  <a href="http://www.cartoonbank.com/cartoon_closeup.asp?pf%5Fid=40163&amp;dept%5Fid=1001&amp;mscssid=WK820NJPPKME9JXPRM4LRRMLQ0WR2SDB&amp;cartoon=1&amp;s_keywords=baby%2Cclothes&amp;findby=popular&amp;s_artist=&amp;s_id=&amp;s_imageType=&amp;color=&amp;s_fromdate=&amp;s_todate=&amp;NewYorkerOnly=&amp;s_topic=">Thoughts from my office door several years ago on this topic</a>.</p>

              <p>Did you know there is software that can be installed which completely changes the way another website looks without you realizing it?  <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=35459">Recipezaar itself has been a victim</a> – well, technically the users who (often accidentally) install this scumware are really the victims but it is the sites that suffer.  In our case, the <a href="http://www.scumware.com/">scumware</a> changes the code of the Amazon ad on our home page, so that another site instead of us gets the credit for any purchases our users make there.  Not only that but the software immediately redirects the user to Amazon, so we lose them.  There is worse scumware out there as well, which changes links on the page or removes YOUR advertising and places competitors ads right on our site.  This should just be illegal, but we don’t have the money to sue these creeps….  Know what is worse?  Because of the way Windows is architected there is no way to know if you have this software installed on your machine because they can hide themselves from the Add/Remove programs control panel – ARG!!!</p>

              <p>Recipezaar Corporate Headquarters actually observed Memorial Day this year – holidays are not big in the startup world.  Troy and I did what the rest of the world did: worked in the yard, relaxed, ate salmon.  I don’t think I even checked e-mail!</p>

              <p>Got a new <a href="http://www.stihlusa.com/blowers/BG85.html">power blower/vac</a> yesterday rather than fix the one that was on its last legs. The driveway and patio will never be dirty again!</p>

<p>I have a fairly unique last name, Hakala, but I’ve run into a couple other unrelated Hakalas in the past, but yesterday I met David Hakala who lives on Vashon. He sold me the blower at the hardware store. Odd, eh?</p>

<p>Yesterday I spent barely any time at all on the computer. I have a hard time staying away from the computer for more than a few hours and the first thing I do in the morning is check the performance graphs of <a href="http://recipezaar.com">the site</a> just to ease my mind that nothing bad happened during the night. I can also check the statistics on my cell phone, but I don’t see the pretty graphs I do on the computer. It’s an addiction.</p>

              <p>Gay went to Seattle yesterday and stayed overnight to help with a friend’s baby shower. I stayed home with the dogs and had a pretty relaxing day (working, but fun &amp; relaxing).</p>

<p>Had a delicious salmon dinner and some white wine. No movies tonight, two stages of the Giro d’Italia, <em>60 Minutes</em> and <em>Sopranos</em>.</p>
