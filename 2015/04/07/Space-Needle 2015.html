<p>Gay’s mom, and my favorite mother-in-law, is in town this week. She likes to have a fancy dinner when she comes to Seattle so we made reservations at the Space Needle restaurant. She was last at the Space Needle during the <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_21_Exposition">World’s Fair in 1962,</a> which it was built for. It’s a work-of-art, it still looks modern and futuristic 52 years later! The kids have never been there. I think I was last there in 1997. </p>

<p>I don’t like touristy stuff but it was a lot of fun, it didn’t feel very touristy. The restaurant revolves a full turn every 45 minutes, which the kids thought was super-cool, so the view is constantly changing and it’s a view of Seattle you don’t see often. We live in a beautiful city, I never tire of seeing the mountains, water, architecture, greenery, etc. </p>

<p>After dinner, we went to the observation deck which has these cool touch screens that show a 360° view and let you go to any date and time and even watch time-lapse videos: </p>

<p>(Even more impressive, it was made by Microsoft!)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.empmuseum.org">EMP Museum</a> is near the Space Needle:</p>

<p>I’ve always thought that the EMP, despite being designed by <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gehry">Frank Gehry</a>, is an eyesore from a distance, so much that I’ve avoided ever going to it. But up close it looks great. One day I’ll have to go. </p>
