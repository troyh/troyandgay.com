<p>It took over 7 months but I <em>finally</em> registered <a href="http://optimism.beer">optimism.beer</a> today. I’ve registered lots of domains over the years and they all took seconds to complete. Not this one…</p>

<p>The registrar for <code>.beer</code> started taking requests for domains in September 2014. I put in my request and then they went silent to me – I couldn’t get any response via email or phone. Eventually, they added an online chat tech support feature to their web site which got me in contact with a person. I was promised I’d have the domain registered that day. That day was February 11. Since then I was told various “technical problems” are preventing them from registering domains. I stopped trying for many weeks and today, on a whim while on vacation, I tried to register it through their web site and this time it worked. Now I need to see if I can transfer it to my favorite registrar to avoid similar problems in the future!</p>
