<p>Unbelievable game today. The Seahawks offense couldnâ€™t do anything right for the first 56 minutes, including 5 turnovers, and it seemed like certain defeat. The defense kept it close, making key goal line stops forcing early FGs and several 3-and-outs late. Then the offense exploded to score <em>15 points in 44 seconds</em>, taking the lead 22-19. The Packers tied it at 22-22 to go to overtime where the Seahawks took 6 plays in 3 minutes 19 seconds to score the winning touchdown and win 28-22 to go to Super Bowl XLIX. This is why I watch (some) sports. </p>

<p>I watched the game two more times to convince myself it really happened. It was a fitting end to the game that Jermaine Kearse caught the winning touchdown after <em>all</em> 4 previous passes to him were intercepted. </p>

<p>The Seattle Times published these cut-outs that Dierdre &amp; Patrick brought over for the kids to make:</p>

<p>Seahawks doughnuts for breakfast is becoming a game day tradition around here:</p>
