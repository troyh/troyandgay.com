<p>There’s been weeks of delays to get to the first brew day but today we did it. I love that it happened to be on Hudson’s birthday, so I can refer to our first beer we brewed as “Hudson Ale”, which is his name. </p>

<p><img src="/img/IMG_1413.JPG" alt="Title" /></p>

<p>This beer won’t be sold, it’s just a test of the brewhouse and, by testing the beer for bacteria over the next several days, a test of our sanitary practices. We’ll also move it through all the tanks to “pickle” them before they get real beers in them. </p>

<p>The brew went well without any catastrophes but it was a long day. We started at 7:30am and left the brewery at 7:30pm. We need to tighten up the routine and get it down to 6-8 hours. We were also interrupted several times by the contractor to make decisions – I am looking forward to the peaceful brews when construction is complete. </p>
