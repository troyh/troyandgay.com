<p>Havana lost not one, but two!, teeth today. Gerene actually pulled them out for her. Havana decided to try an experiment: she told Gerene, Hudson and Eva not to tell me or Gay so she could see if the Tooth Fairy showed up. She has been suspicious that the Tooth Fairy is not real and that it is her parents that leave the note and money. </p>

<p>Impressively, she and her brother and sister kept it a secret all day and evening. The next morning, she announced that she knows the Tooth Fairy is real because she did visit! Her <em>scientific method</em> makes me proud. And she was very happy to have her belief in the Tooth Fairy restored. </p>

<p>Itâ€™s been 4 months since <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2014/11/15/Havana-lost%20another%20tooth.html">she lost her 8th tooth</a>. </p>
