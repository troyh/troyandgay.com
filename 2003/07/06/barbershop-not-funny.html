    <p>I was hoping for a side-splitting comedy and didn’t laugh once.  I feel asleep and have no compunction to watch the last 20 minutes where undoubtedly the “friends all pull together to save the shop from the evil guy.”  Bad acting, bad stereotypes, and blaxploitation plot lines made this movie a real loser for me.  Ice cube was the only thing this movie had going for it.  Why on earth could they not just get a real old black man like Ossie Davis or something to play the old black guy, rather than throwing a little grey hair on Cedric the Annoying.</p>
