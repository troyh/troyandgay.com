    <p>Google’s new ad program is the worst thing to hit the internet since, well, since the internet. Google had a “brilliant” idea to put their text ads on sites that are targetted to the content. But they do this not by referencing their cache of pages on their own servers, but they do it by immediately doing a request to the site to find out what is on the page. So, in effect, Google doubles the load on a site immediately! There’s smart people at Google, why couldn’t they figure out that their idea was a very very bad one?</p>

<p>We have no choice but to remove Google’s ads from our site.</p>
