    <p>I accidentally saw the above headline yesterday so I was dreading every moment of yesterday’s stage as we watched it last night.  I didn’t see how the headline ended so I  know if he was losing or out of the tour or whatever.  I was on pins and needles during the descents and stomach-turning as Lance took off his helmet for the final climb.  It really was an amazing stage.  Go Lance!  …and there is a short story some where to be written about the little boy with the musette who pulled the yellow jersey off his bike.</p>
