  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I finished the new Harry Potter the weekend before last in an all Sunday marathon session.  I liked it quite a lot but the 3rd remains my favorite.  I am thoroughly charmed by Harry, and Rowlings ability to rejuvenate young readers.  Remarkably I returned to <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/06/001514.php">The Clinton Wars</a> and will finish it tonight.  I am also now reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735712018/recipezaar-20"><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/dws100.gif" alt="dws100.gif" />Designing with Web Standards</a> online using <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">O’Reilly’s Safari bookshelf</a> (you pay $20/month and can read 5 technical books).  It is a great book on web standards, but it is perfect to read online because he links to so many sites and they are real links online and on paper, well, you have retype them. (click the pic to check it out at Amazon, more comments later).</p>
