  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I tried all last week to get the <a href="http://www.shands.org/">University of Florida in Gainesville</a> to get my dad in to see a neurologist. Although they promised every time to call his doctor immediately, they never did â€“ doctors with their <a href="http://www.davidslife.com/journal/archives/000129.php">God Complex</a> are always too busy. So no appointment was ever made. Fortunately, his physician got him to see a local neurologist. Should be just as good.</p>

<p>My dad visited the neurologist today and he confirmed, apparently emphatically, that he does have hydrocephalus. I feel a lot more comfortable with that as do my parents. So next Thursday he goes in for his operation.</p>
