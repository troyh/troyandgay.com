    <p>My dad came home from the hospital today and we talked to him on the phone (and also gave them <a href="/archives/2003/09/001696.php#001696">the big news</a>). He sounded very alert, moreso than before I think. I don’t know if that’s because of the operation, but he does say that he has an easier time walking already (the biggest symptom of hydrocephalus is trouble walking) and he says that his head is “more clear”. He’s still sore from the operation and can’t do anything strenuous for 30 days but it’s all very encouraging. This week should be very interesting, as the first week tends to show great improvement after the shunt surgery.</p>

<p>My sister flew from Virginia to Florida this morning to spend the week with them and help out.</p>
