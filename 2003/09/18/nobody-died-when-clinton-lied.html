    <p>“We’ve had no evidence that Saddam Hussein was involved with the September 11th,” Bush said in an impromptu session with reporters. He contended, however, that “there’s no question that Saddam Hussein had Al Qaeda ties.” (<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-2connectsep18,1,314262.story?coll=la-headlines-world">LA Times</a>)</p>

<p>The United States has “ties” to Al Qaeda, for goodness sakes!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hans Blix “believes that Iraq destroyed most of its weapons of mass destruction 10 years ago, but kept up the appearance that it had them to deter a military attack.” (<a href="http://www.drudgereportarchives.com/goto/?getPage=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elasvegassun%2Ecom%2Fsunbin%2Fstories%2Ftext%2F2003%2Fsep%2F17%2F091702041%2Ehtml&amp;return=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Edrudgereportarchives%2Ecom%2Fdsp%2Flinks%5Frecap%2Ehtm">Associated Press</a>)  His team was given 3 months to find WMD, but in the 5 months since the overthrow the 1,400 person team of scientists, military and intelligence experts still haven’t found anything more. (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/09/18/sprj.irq.blix.bush/index.html">CNN</a>)</p>

<p>As I recall, we were sold this war on the basis of WMD that could be used against us by terrorists…<a href="http://www.nobodydied.com">Nobody died when Clinton Lied</a></p>

<p>…number of Iraqis killed so far: 6,000.</p>
