  <article class="post-content">
    <p>My mom is visiting (and cooking for us – yum!).  Mark &amp; Lee have finally moved back to Seattle (so our guest room is empty of furniture again – bad).  The weather here has been terrible so our house has no paint on it. I’m training for the <a href="http://www.seattlemarathon.org/">Seattle half-marathon</a> with my friend Megan – doing 8 miles this weekend.  We’ve been doing more hardware upgrades for <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> which never quite go as planned – in fact, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000668GF/recipezaar-20/104-0474988-1243147">Troy’s cel phone</a> was a casualty of the installation – but more annoying is that we work so dang hard and then people in our bulletin boards cause a ruckus and we then have to spend hours sending warning letters and generally baby-sitting people who are supposed to be adults – annoying – keeping us from doing our real jobs.</p>
