  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Got a new <a href="http://www.stihlusa.com/blowers/BG85.html">power blower/vac</a> yesterday rather than fix the one that was on its last legs. The driveway and patio will never be dirty again!</p>

<p>I have a fairly unique last name, Hakala, but I’ve run into a couple other unrelated Hakalas in the past, but yesterday I met David Hakala who lives on Vashon. He sold me the blower at the hardware store. Odd, eh?</p>

<p>Yesterday I spent barely any time at all on the computer. I have a hard time staying away from the computer for more than a few hours and the first thing I do in the morning is check the performance graphs of <a href="http://recipezaar.com">the site</a> just to ease my mind that nothing bad happened during the night. I can also check the statistics on my cell phone, but I don’t see the pretty graphs I do on the computer. It’s an addiction.</p>
