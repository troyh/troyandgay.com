  <article class="post-content">
    <p>At the Mariners game last night, we found ourselves in a room full of big Seattle  business people and John was anxious to introduce us to many of them. Significantly, we met a woman who was one of the early investors in <a href="http://www.homegrocer.com/">HomeGrocer.com</a> and acted as the CFO and sat on their board early on. HomeGrocer was destroyed in <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1017-269594.html?legacy=cnet">the mess that was Webvan</a>. She had some very interesting and quality advice for us. And here I thought we were just going to a baseball game. Life is funny that way.</p>
