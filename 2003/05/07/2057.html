    <p>A funny thing happened on the way to the game….. we were driving down the West Seattle Bridge and Gay, who was driving, took the wrong exit. So while on the exit ramp, she decided she was going to get back into traffic and take the next (correct) exit instead. There was a median in the way, but Gay didn’t see it. She took the median at 50+ MPH, then realized when the car was straddling the median that the median was there. She went all the way over the median and decided to stop on the bridge (actually at my suggestion that she not enter 60MPH traffic from a near stop). We eventually made the correct exit and I’m glad to have survived and I’m glad the car did too (as far as we know).</p>

<p>I think I’ll be driving from now on. If I die in a car accident, it’s going to be <strong>my</strong> fault.</p>
