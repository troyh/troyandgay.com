  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Unlike the rest of the world, I was not excited about seeing the 2nd Matrix movie. The first one was okay. I wasn’t expecting much (why would I? Keanu Reeves is in it) but was impressed by the innovative special effects. The plot is a re-hash of every Philosophy 101 course (is the world really just our imagination?) so my brain wasn’t twisted inside-out trying to comprehend the concept. But the effects sure were cool, so I figured Matrix Reloaded would be more of the same.</p>

<p>A friend did go see it and wasn’t impressed. Now I find this <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/5/15/22352/6060">review</a>: _ I will attempt to describe how suckrageous this movie was without revealing any spoilers or major plot points, though this might be difficult._</p>

<p>Maybe I’ll just wait for the DVD.</p>
