  <article class="post-content">
    <p>This morning I got a comment to my <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/07/001588.php">I hate Google</a> post that was clearly very angry and very defensive about Google from someone who clearly didn’t understand what I was talking about. I deleted it since it was full of expletives. I thought it was weird to get a comment on such an old post but then I did a search on Google for “I hate Google” and it’s the #2 item in the results.</p>

<p>Google is a good search engine (I use it almost exclusively) but they’re not perfect and they clearly made some mistakes when designing GoogleAds. And yes, I do think that Google has too much power already.</p>
