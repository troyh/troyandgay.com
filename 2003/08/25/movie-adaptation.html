    <p><a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/adaptation-superbit/index.html">Adaptation</a> was an interesting movie. Kaufmann is a creative writer and Nicolas Cage was impressive as was the trick photography used to make these characters interact with each other.</p>

<p>The movie is intertwined with itself on several levels. The movie was about the writing of the screenplay adaptation of a book, a screenplay that included the characters from <a href="http://www.susanorlean.com/articles/orchid_fever.html">the real-life story</a>, the movie mirrored the actual thought process behind the screenwriting and the characters adapted to life the way the subject of the movie/book/article, orchids, adapt to their environment. All in all, very clever, interesting and entertaining.</p>
