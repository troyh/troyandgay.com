    <p>In contrast to nice people like Bergy, we recently had a member on the site threaten people with violence! This person even posted postal addresses for some people and implied that “someone” was going to pay them a visit. There are some real whackos in the world!</p>

<p>So now we’re in the process of contacting law-enforcement officials in this person’s area. Fortunately, their ISP is taking this very seriously and is working with us to determine who the person is. So that’s how my day’s going.</p>

<p>I wonder if all recipe web sites have to deal with this type of stuff.</p>
