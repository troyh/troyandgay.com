  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I just got a (very sweet) email from a CS student at Waterloo University that was inspired by a PowerPoint presentation that I gave at Microsoft on being a Program Manager…gosh, at least 4 years ago?! Funny to think how your digital stuff can move around even after you have gone – always could with paper too, but it would seem that the “bits” stuff should be <em>more</em> ephemeral not less.</p>

<p>Which raises a question:  now that all our pictures, and history (this blog) are now electronic, who will keep it up when we have gone?  Seems like there must be a decent archiving business in that.  Archiving websites/domains/content forever.  We’ve gradually moved super 8 to VHS to DVD…  If you know of one that already exists, comment.</p>
