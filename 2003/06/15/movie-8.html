    <p>Saw the widely-acclaimed <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/movies/reviews/movie/1688385">8 Mile</a> last night. I was worried that it would be full of macho rapping (Disclaimer: I’m not a rap fan <em>at all</em>) like the 80s break-dancing movies and the 70s roller-skating/disco movies were, but it wasn’t, in fact there was very little rapping. That was good. The rest of the movie wasn’t. Boring story – you see the end coming from 8 miles away. Eminem basically played himself, except that his character is anti-violence, pro-civil rights, and get this, he’s a caring guy always trying to do what’s best for females. Remember, Eminem is the nitwit who has been up on <a href="http://www.freep.com/news/metro/rap8_20000608.htm">gun and assault charges</a> and raps about violence against women, Jews, Blacks and homosexuals. Maybe he is a good actor?</p>
