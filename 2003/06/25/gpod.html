    <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/ipod.jpg" alt="ipod.jpg" />My new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> arrived last week.  Got a most excellent deal on the 30gig version from dell, though <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/05/001428.php">it took like a month to get here</a>.  I’ve experienced the same problems others have with hangs and resets running with it in the clip, but only rarely now that i run with it in my hand.  I’m now on a cd burning spree and rediscovering old music.  I’ve got 12gigs/2959 songs so far.  I can’t begin to express how interesting it is to listen to music that entered my collection 10-15 years ago (too bad kevin doesn’t have a blog for me to link to his dissertation on this), though I’m sure there are blog entries to come about certain bands – I’m only up to the Cs in my ripping.  One thing i did want to mention is the utter beauty of this device.  I thought Troy’s 5gig iPod was cool when he got it last year, but this is lighter, smaller and just amazing to control with the heat-sensitive buttons and circular trackpad.  I’m surprised Troy hasn’t posted the photos of us unpacking it.  Now we just need to <a href="http://gallery.ipodlounge.com/index.php">post a photo of gPod on Vashon</a></p>
