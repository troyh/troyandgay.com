  <article class="post-content">
    <p>We finally saw <a href="http://wilcofilm.com/">I’m Trying To Break Your Heart</a>, a movie about the making of <a href="http://www.wilcoworld.net/">Wilco</a>’s <a href="http://www.wilcoworld.net/records/yhf.html">Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</a> album. <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em> is my pick for 2002 album of the year. This album is especially notable because their record label dropped them after hearing the album calling it a “career-ending record” and claiming it was unmarketable. While trying to find a new label to distribute the record, they posted the album on their web site for free and it began to spread. After a year, a new label picked them up and it was released in April 2002. <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=2043926&amp;cf=">Rolling Stone</a> called it the “Album of the Year” and it’s widely-regarded as their best album to date.</p>

<p>It just goes to show that the people who control the music we listen to are clueless. And thanks to the Internet, good bands now have a way to get heard.</p>

<p>But the movie could have been better. It glossed over the rift that caused a member to be asked to leave. And it had more live footage of their shows than it did of studio time. I always find it fascinating to watch musicians create songs. The creative process – the sometimes haphazard decisions mixed with the careful thought – that goes into making great songs is fun to watch. But this movie lacked most of that. And it stopped right when the band got re-signed, rather than show the reaction of the fans and media to the album. I think that would have made a better film and made the truth about the recording industry’s misunderstanding of its own market more evident.</p>
