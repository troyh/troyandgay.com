    <p><a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&amp;cf=info&amp;id=1808396051&amp;intl=us">Antwone Fisher</a> was not a very good movie. The acting was okay, the story ended pleasantly, but there are far better uplifting movies to see than this. I’m surprised it’s rated as highly as it is. I guess it has all the bullet points to make critics happy: child abuse, disadvantaged youth, struggle, happy ending. And that subplot between Denzel and  his wife was barely involved, yet it supposedly was critical to the movie. Seems like there was a lot of missing scenes about that.</p>
