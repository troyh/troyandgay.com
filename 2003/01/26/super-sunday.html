    <p>The Super Bowl is today. Adam Blum, of all people, is coming over with this 2 kids. I havenâ€™t seen him in 5 years or so. Biff may come over. Gary Sipple is coming over too (Nancy is out of town in Oregon).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Game was boring, Tampa Bay blew the Raiders out. Adam and his daughter, Liz, came out and Gary came over. Biff opted out as Renuka had to write a paper or something. We had beers, wine, chips, a great 7-layer dip, wings and ribs for dinner.</p>

<p>Gary showed me how to chop wood so I can finish the tree in the backyard! Adam &amp; Liz had to go after the game but Gary stayed and had ribs with us.</p>
