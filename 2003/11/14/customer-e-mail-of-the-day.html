    <p>“YOU ARE A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR A C<em>CKSUCKER AND A MOTHERF</em>CKING SON-OF-A-BITCH.  YOU ARE A GOOD EXAMPLE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD STRIVE TO RAISE THEIR LIKE.
C<em>CKSUCKING THIEF AND MOTHERF</em>CKING BASTARD. C<em>CKSUCKING THIEF AND MOTHERF</em>CKING BASTARD. C<em>CKSUCKING THIEF AND MOTHERF</em>CKING BASTARD.”

Awww, so sweet.</p>
