  <article class="post-content">
    <p>The cover story of this weekâ€™s Pacific Northwest Magazine is about <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/pacificnw/2003/1102/cover.html">the burgeoning wine industry in Walla Walla</a> (where I went to college).  I {heart} Walla Walla, so I would be happy to see it become the next Sonoma or Napa, as it would give me more reasons to visit, as well as more for the provincial farmers to bemoan about the growth of the city, once the capital of the territory.</p>

<p>You can now make the same amount on 40 acres of grapes as farmers did on 40,000 acres of wheat.  (via Reid)</p>
