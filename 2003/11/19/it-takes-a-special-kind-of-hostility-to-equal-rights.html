    <p>I suppose I shouldn’t have been, but I was astounded at the Congressional reaction to the Massachusetts Supreme Court decision on the legality of gay marriage.  I do believe it will be impossible to get a Constitutional amendment to support the idea that marriage must be between a man and a woman, but I can’t believe they are even suggesting it.  I can’t stand the way they way the conservatives keep saying we need to “do this for the children” when I don’t know a single gay divorced family…  I especially like the way Hit &amp; Run, the Reason magazine weblog, describes it as causing “<a href="http://www.reason.com/hitandrun/003485.shtml">the equivalent of a divide-by-zero error in the circuitry of conservative brains, which are short circuiting en masse</a>.”</p>

<p>I really just don’t get what the problem is…marriage is sacrosanct to everyone that does it right?  Shouldn’t they be glad that the “prurient” gay heathens will now be monogamous?</p>
