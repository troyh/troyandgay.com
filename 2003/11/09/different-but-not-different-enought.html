    <p>Well, Troy seems disappointed that we donâ€™t argue enough in this blog, <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/11/001810.php#001810">this post</a> certainly worked: <em>Not only did Gay completely miss the point, she also forgot the point and refuses to get the point. Women!</em></p>

<p>Frankly, we rarely disagree on issues so it is difficult to present other perspectives on cue, and together I think we present a more rounded picture of our life and interests than each of us would individually.  More than anything he seems disappointed that I post less frequently than he does.  To me it is personal, and getting into a personal space for posting is rare.  Perhaps, we never discussed what the point of this blog is because I think we might have different visions.</p>

<p>There. We disagree.</p>
