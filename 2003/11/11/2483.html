  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I just upgraded to a new version of a great little app that sits in my menu bar and tells me the current weather and the forecast called <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/heat-meteo">Meteorologist</a>. While checking out the new features, I find this in the About screen:</p>

<p>This is the final release of Meteorologist from Humongous Elephants and Tigers.  I worked on Meteo for quite some time while I attending the University of Illinois, but I am sad to announce that no future development will be done on my part (although many could have guessed that this was coming).</p>

<p>To those who hate my guts - you probably have good reason, and I hope your hatred is doused a little with pity.  I have been woefully behind on emails and updates.  I have plenty of excuses, but that doesn’t really matter.</p>

<p>Meteorologist is now officially out of my hands.  I will be hunting around to find someone to take up the torch, and to try to take up the good fight.</p>

<p>Best of luck to everyone,
Matthew Fahrenbacher</p>

<p>The author gets hate e-mail from people about it so he’s quitting development of it. It’s completely free software! The author does nothing but a positive thing and he gets hate mail about it! Never underestimate how mean people can be to other people.</p>
