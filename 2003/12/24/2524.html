    <p>The internet and democratic software are visible players in the 2004 Presidential election. This is  a far cry from just the 1996 election where no candidate even knew what the internet was and few even used computers. But 2004 is different. Clark is <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,61723,00.html">starting an open source project</a> to build campaign software for anyone to use. And Dean, the most internet-aware candidate, has been <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.01/dean.html">aggressively using the internet</a> in his campaign. Coincidentally, we were notified by our ad agency a couple days ago that the Dean campaign has bought advertising on <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a>. We’re going to be part of US History as I’m sure the internet will continue to play a larger role in politics. (I’d better study up on Dean’s platform cuz I’m sure we’ll be accused of being Dean-supporters because of this).</p>
