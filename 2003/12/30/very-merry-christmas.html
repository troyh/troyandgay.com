    <p>Our Christmas this year was in the top five all time holidays – and that includes the one when I got my first bike.  We had a lovely Christmas Eve dinner with friends on the island, John, Deborah and JT Bender, with their friends the Mitchells.  Christmas dinner was here with friends Mark &amp; Lee, Lee’s sister &amp; brother-in-law Nathalie &amp; Robert visiting from England, Steve &amp; Renuka &amp; son Owen, and the Agostinelli sisters Jen &amp; Nicki.  We drank lots of champagne and home made egg nog (Troy).  We had a lovely roast beef dinner complete with traditional Yorkshire puddings and English Roasters and (Steve’s first time) horseradish sauce, mostly orchestrated by Lee; followed by Christmas Pudding and brandy sauce which came all the way from England; followed by a game of Pictionary; further followed by the largest piece of Stilton I have ever seen and port wine, another gift of Nathalie &amp; Robert.  It really was delightful in every corny sense of the word.</p>
