    <p><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/archives/004490.html">Kos</a> does the math, and there was no record turnout in the Callyforkneeia election.  Different segments voted, but not more people.  The election was fair (2% more people voted for Arnold than voted Davis into office to begin with), but don’t get your hopes up that democracy is more alive or something.  This has me a little bummed, because the only hopeful analysis we’d heard, argued that it is a sign that everyone is dissatisfied with the current administration.
