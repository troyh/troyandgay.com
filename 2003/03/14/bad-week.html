  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Today marks the end of a frustrating week for me. Building another new server for <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> has been difficult and time-consuming and the 2am nights haven’t left much room for sleep. Yes, we build <em>everything</em> ourselves, from software to hardware – we even make our own ethernet cables! Why? Because I’m a big believer that it’s always best to fully understand how the important things work, plus its fun and cost-effective. That was the theory anyway. But it feels like the worst is behind me now. The rest is just software.</p>

<p>On top of that (and my two flat tires on my bike in one day), twice this week my Mac had “kernel panics”. The screen went grey and a <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=107061&amp;SaveKCWindowURL=http%3A%2F%2Fkbase.info.apple.com%2Fcgi-bin%2FWebObjects%2Fkbase.woa%2Fwa%2FSaveKCToHomePage&amp;searchMode=Assisted&amp;kbhost=kbase.info.apple.com&amp;showButton=true&amp;randomValue=100&amp;showSurvey=false&amp;sessionID=9460704!troy@recipezaar.com%7C166457042">white box</a> popped up and told me, in four languages, that I need to restart. But I must say that Macs are pretty even when they crash. From looking at the panic.log that OS X made, it looks like it has something to do with audio. Will send to Apple for advice.</p>
