  <article class="post-content">
    <p>We moved 18 months ago to a new house and never bought any furniture to furnish it until very recently. Back in early December, we were lucky enough to find 4 chairs we liked while we were in NYC, so we bought ‘em. One arrived months ago and the 2nd one arrived today! We still have two more coming in the next few months if we’re lucky. Advice: be careful about buying furniture from <a href="http://www.abchome.com/">ABC Carpet &amp; Home</a> and if you do, <strong>do not</strong> have <a href="http://www.ukaydelivery.com/">UKay</a> ship it!</p>
