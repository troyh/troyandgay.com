    <p>I finally went against the geek in me and ditched <a href="http://sendmail.org">sendmail</a> from our internal mail server and moved to the simpler <a href="http://www.postfix.org">Postfix</a>. The reason being that I simply couldn’t figure out how to configure sendmail to send mail to another server as a relay. Seems so simple and I even read the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/sendmail2/">bat book</a> to try to figure it out, but was unsuccessful. Postfix did it with one configuration setting.</p>

<p><a href="http://fetchmail.org">Fetchmail</a> still pulls down our mail from our public mail server to our internal server and it worked without a hitch with Postfix. And Postfix was amazingly easy to install, it even makes itself a replacement for sendmail by aliasing the sendmail binaries to itself. I wish I’d done this years ago!</p>
