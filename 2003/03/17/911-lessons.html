    <p>It sounds like we’ll be at war in Iraq this week. <a href="http://www.skirsch.com/politics/iraq/Lessons911.htm">The 5 lessons of 911</a> is interesting.</p>

<p>Of course, I’m against the war (I’m anti-killing). But I think the UN blew it on this one. Since <a href="http://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm">its inception</a>, this is the first chance the UN has had to show the world that it is an authoritative body. Five months ago, they <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/11/08/iraq.resolution/">voted</a> <em>unanimously</em> to force Iraq to disarm and to support military action if they didn’t disarm. <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/world/default-200312716917.htm">They didn’t disarm</a>. But the UN is still mired in debate over something they agreed to just 5 months ago. I believe that if the UN was a united front against Hussein for the last 5 months instead of being wishy-washy, this would have been resolved peacefully: either Hussein would take his billions and run away or he’d be overthrown.</p>

<p>The sad reality is that in the future, when the UN speaks, world leaders will ignore it. But they will likely not ignore the US. And that’s unlikely to create a peaceful world (and will “Americanize” the world with McDonald’s restaurants, Wal*Marts and lousy beer).</p>
