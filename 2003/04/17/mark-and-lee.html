  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Our good friend Mark has just returned home from a couple of years working in England and Holland.  Yet another great story of leaving a going-nowhere, make-you-unhappy job with cushy amenities, like living abroad and the promise of paper money, for a radical life change.  Mark is going back to school to become a commercial photographer.  Lee is also considering a new (third) career and perhaps school.  Unfortunately Lee is Mark’s boyfriend and British, which pretty much makes it impossible for him to work here.  Even going to school will be difficult, though he can get a visa (if accepted) he won’t be able to work to support himself.  In England, they’d only have to register as domestic partners: same as being married.  Makes me so sad that our stupid country is so backwards on this, and causing them so much stress.</p>
