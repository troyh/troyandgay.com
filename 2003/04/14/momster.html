    <p>My mom was here for a visit this weekend.  Friday potluck with Gary &amp; Nancy and John &amp; Deborah…so much fun, so much wine.   Hilariously, Nancy revealed her jealously of her granddaughter (perhaps a common syndrome, I dunno, I found it facinating) and we had a regular Prozac Nation group session.  Funny.

Mike told me how much he loves his grandchildren too and how he wants to take his grandkids fishing and teach them stuff.  He wants to be like his dad was to his kids: available.  When you are young and  making a living you can’t always be available.  He told me “don’t wait too long to have kids, because you don’t want to miss out on really being able to enjoy being a grandparent.”</p>
