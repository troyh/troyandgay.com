    <p>The ferry ride is only 15 minutes.  <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/transportation/118119_needles18.html">Apparently there are problems with needles on the ferries so they have installed biohazard disposals in the bathrooms</a>.  I suppose if you have diabetes you migh appreciate this, but I have to assume that you are probably very responsible with your biohazards already.  If you are doing <em>other</em> drugs will you really take the time?  Why do the ferries need this when I have not seen such a disposal in a public restroom outside of a hospital EVER.  Perhaps I’m a little sensitive since they are cutting back our service due to budgets already and now I find out they spent time and money on this.  Noteably the article mentions there are 1,000 ferry workers and 68,000 riders.  1 worker to every 68 riders sure seems like a heck of a lot to me…</p>
