    <p>The dogs started barking hysterically and running around at 5am this morning, went to see who was breaking into the house and then saw a cat sitting in the driveway (how do they know a cat is outside when they’re asleep?). I figured I’d stay up. Mistake; I fell asleep on the couch at 6am reading email.</p>

<p>Finally finished updating the nutritional info for <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a>, which took way longer than expected, partly due to unrelated hardware issues. But we’ve now got some fun new data to play with which will let us do cool stuff for diabetics and lactose-intolerant people.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and we hit <a href="http://recipezaar.com">56,000</a> recipes today!</p>
