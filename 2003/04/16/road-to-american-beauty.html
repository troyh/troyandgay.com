    <p>Saw [](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/RoadtoPerdition-1114614/)Road to Perdition last night – first dvd we’ve watched in a month or something.  Paul Newman was easily the best part of the film; he delivers several amazing speeches/lines and commands your attention every moment he is on screen.  The story is good, but it is cloddingly revealed.  Jude Law tries to act creepy and uses one too many tricks to prove it, so he just is annoying.  The cinematography is excellent – god, does it ever stop raining there – but in the end I’m completely outside the core dilemma: Newman (family before good business) v. Hanks (good business before family).  Hank’s choice let him to perdition. Mendes’s [](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/AmericanBeauty-1093536/)American Beauty was a much better movie.  As Troy says “He made American Beauty, no wonder I didn’t like this.”</p>
