            <p>This Tour isn’t finished yet, but it’s the best Tour I’ve ever seen. Lance crashed (!) at the bottom of the final climb after a fan’s hat (or musette) grabbed Lance’s handlebar and pulled him to the ground. And he still won the stage by 40 seconds! Today was the first day of this Tour where he showed his superiority and it was amazing how fluidly he rode the last climb. Lance put 40 seconds into Ullrich, plus a time bonus gave him a lead of 67 seconds over Ullrich. Ullrich will have to ride an incredible time trial and Lance would have to do terribly on Friday to beat Lance.</p>

<p>On the downside, Iban Mayo demonstrated the most unsportsman-like behavior I’ve seen in sports. After Lance crashed (and Iban Mayo also fell on the crash) Iban Mayo quickly got up and tried to attack. Then when Lance came back, his pedal/cleat was broken and Lance slipped off his pedal again and almost stopped. Iban Mayo attacked <em>again</em>. Lance chased him and blew him away. So Iban Mayo stuck to Ullrich’s wheel the entire climb up the mountain so Ullrich did <em>all</em> the work and then just feet before the finish, he passed Ullrich and took 2nd on the stage. Cycling is an incredibly gentlemanly sport, but Mayo proved that he is not worthy of a good career. I will enjoy watching every defeat in his career. On the other hand, Ullrich is not only a great sportsman (he waited for Lance after he fell) he is a powerful cyclist that deserves to win the Tour many times in  the future.</p>

            <p>Uh oh! I can’t explain how I know this just yet, but I know there is <strong>big</strong> news about the Tour de France and/or Lance Armstrong on the front pages of both the New York Times and CNN! I have a bad bad feeling about this. I don’t know how I’m going to wait til tonight to watch the coverage. <em>Ugh!</em> Turning off radio, being extra careful with reading email and avoiding any news-related web site today!</p>

            <p>Since the week is filled with work on <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a>, we spent the entire weekend hammering out lots of code for (yet) another web site. It was hot this weekend too and we sat in the office in front of our computers, which got to be uncomfortable. But we made lots of progress at least. We didn’t quite finish it, which was our goal for the weekend, but we’re close. And the coolest thing is although the site is very different from <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a>, a lot of the software can (and will) be used for Recipezaar.</p>

Lance leads Ullrich by 15 seconds and Vinokourov by 18 seconds. If nothing happens tomorrow, the race will come down to the final stage, another time trial. And given that Ullrich crushed Lance by 1:36 in the first time trial, that’s not good for Lance.</p>

            <p>Today’s award for good use of internet: <a href="http://www.codeasart.com/poetry/darwin.html">The Darwinian Poetry site</a>.  In an experiment, this guy has taken 1,000 random words and creates random poems out of them.  You vote between two which poem is better, and he slices the better poem with a new one to make a superior poem.  It will take a hundred of us monkies to see if the computer can eventually create a good poem.  So far the only measurable result is that poems with the word “ship” in them do better.</p>
