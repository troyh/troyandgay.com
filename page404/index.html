          </h3>
            <p>After our fourth outage in as many days as we scrambled to get Recipezaar’s new hardware and new cache architecture working, we were about to throw in the towel we were so fed up.  Finally Troy discovered the dumb permissions problem causing this last error and Recipezaar was running again, but the owners hit the wall.  We took the afternoon off, took a nap, had dinner at an outside restaurant (see Troy’s blog) and watched Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets – review to come, the old kids fell asleep watching it.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Being tired from the late nights and stressful days, we went to La Playa (mexican) for dinner, which is right next to the ferry pier, and sat outside watching the ferries float by. One (of the 2) cops on the island drove up the pier, parked, got out, walked to another car, tapped on the window, asked the driver to get out, handcuffed him and put him in the back of the police car. Then another cop. They took pictures of the car and then they took pictures of the guy. Then an ambulance, two fire cars and then a big fire truck drove up. The guy was unhandcuffed, the medics took care of him. Then another ambulance drove up. Out came a stretcher, the guy got a neck brace and was put on the stretcher and put in the second ambulance. This is odd on Vashon, by the way. A bystander told us that the windshield and/or front window were smashed. Seems like the guy was in a hit-and-run accident.</p>

            <p>Another jump in Alexa. Up to <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details?url=recipezaar.com">9,150</a>. I hate to say it, but I enjoy that our biggest competitor, AllRecipes, is consistently falling in the same ranking. $20 million in debt and still losing $4 million/yr, AllRecipes should be humbled, but they are less than the nicest people in this biz and they’ve even tried to flex their muscle against us with copyright violation claims on recipes they stole from other people. I also think it’s funny that we’ve had more than one employee of theirs call us asking for a job. :-)</p>
