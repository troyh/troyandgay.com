He quit his job at <a href="http://real.com">Real Networks</a> and is starting a new life in <a href="http://www.austin-chamber.org/">Austin</a>, Texas in June.</p>

<p>This morning, Ouzo and Steve’s dog, Rose, got in a fight over breakfast. I stupidly fed our dogs without separating the other two dogs and Rose wanted to share Ouzo’s food. Ouzo’s usually so nice but he went nuts and attacked Rose. It was a struggle to pull them apart. Scary.</p>

It’s <a href="http://www.biketoworkday.org/Education/bike_to_work.cfm">Bike To Work Day</a> and I just got back from a bike ride. Our friend Steve is coming over tonight before he moves to Austin, Texas. I’m working on a really fun new thing for the site. Life is good.</p>

              <p>The dishonesty cited in this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/15/technology/15SOFT.html?pagewanted=1&amp;th">NYT article</a> and the recent <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoft/134731106_iloo14.html">lying about the iLoo</a> by Microsoft gets under my skin. I’m not so naive as to believe corporations are altruistic, but I do expect them to not be outright liars, especially when their marketing budget used to push the lies exceeds the GDP of many countries.</p>

<p>The Microsoft employees posing as non-Microsoft employees at conferences reminds me of the time I went to a Netscape conference in 1997 as a Microsoft employee. I attended a talk about Netscape’s mail server product with another Microsoft employee and during the Q&amp;A period, my coworker took off his badge (that said “Microsoft” on it), asked me to take mine off, and then he got up and asked a question intended to imply to the audience that Netscape was lying about their product. He knew and I knew that Netscape wasn’t lying, but the audience probably was less sure. I’m not purporting that this is the reason Netscape died as a company, but it was one of the many things I was involved with at Microsoft that just left a bad taste in my mouth.</p>
