            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>I read an interesting old article in the <em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com">New Yorker</a></em>, the <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/2002/2002_07_22_a_talent.htm">“Talent Myth”</a> by Malcolm Gladwell, yesterday (why do I feel like a snob when I read articles in that magazine??).</p>

<p>The article talked about how the famous consulting group McKinsey spent the latter half of the 90s teaching corporations that the difference between successful and unsuccessful organizations is that the successful ones hire “talent”. The idea being that any organization filled with smart people would be guaranteed success. Enron took this to heart the most and, judging by the article, made a complete mess of itself by promoting by talent rather than accomplishments or skills. We know what happened to them. It also discusses the US Navy and its initial failures during WWII and how better management turned it around for them.</p>

<p>This idea that the system is important is curiously similar to computer science (or do I just think everything relates to computer science?). The key to computer science is that you need the right algorithm, or system of doing things, and the rest just works well – things like faster computers, smarter developers, newer technology, etc. are of little or no consequence.</p>

<p>It also fits well in nature… for example, if you create a system where people like to have sex, the species will perpetuate itself – there’s no need to educate each generation on the virtues of perpetuating the species.</p>

<p>The American form of government follows this pattern. The founding fathers created a smart system, one that even dumb politicians can’t screw up (terribly bad, anyway).</p>

              <p>Gave my bike a spring/pre-summer overhaul (washed and oiled). Weekly yardwork. Great weather too. I can’t believe the weather has been so great in Seattle as early as mid-May – we’ve had a good 4 straight days of sunny days with just a sprinkle of rain here and there.</p>

              <p>Unlike the rest of the world, I was not excited about seeing the 2nd Matrix movie. The first one was okay. I wasn’t expecting much (why would I? Keanu Reeves is in it) but was impressed by the innovative special effects. The plot is a re-hash of every Philosophy 101 course (is the world really just our imagination?) so my brain wasn’t twisted inside-out trying to comprehend the concept. But the effects sure were cool, so I figured Matrix Reloaded would be more of the same.</p>

<p>A friend did go see it and wasn’t impressed. Now I find this <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/5/15/22352/6060">review</a>: _ I will attempt to describe how suckrageous this movie was without revealing any spoilers or major plot points, though this might be difficult._</p>

<p>Maybe I’ll just wait for the DVD.</p>
