            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/DVDPlayerScreenSnapz001.jpg" alt="" />Kathy left on Saturday morning after a productive and fun week together. We ate and cooked a lot (and took over 100 photos to prove it!). We planned to watch <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&amp;cf=info&amp;id=1808405432">The Incredibles</a>, but we only got the Extras DVD, so we watched <a href="http://www.miramax.com/quietamerican/">The Quiet American</a>, which was good, even though we all fell asleep at one point or another during it (although that was probably caused more by the wine than the movie).</p>

<p>On Saturday, after returning from the airport, we dropped the movies off at Blockbuster and they gave us the correct DVD for The Incredibles. We watched it that night and loved it! It may be my favorite <a href="http://pixar.com">Pixar</a> movie yet.</p>

<p>I spent the rainy weekend doing a lot of miscellaneous work that I’ve needed to do while Gay, who was running around for weeks without rest, relaxed and went for a 19-mile run Sunday morning.</p>

            <p>A Norwegian fish newspaper, <a href="http://fiskaren.intrafish.no/">Fiskaren</a>, published an article on Recipezaar, apparently because of our cod recipes (not because I’m half-Norwegian). It’s in Norwegian, of course, so we don’t know what it says. Can anyone read Norwegian and translate the gist of it? Let us know and we’ll send you the article (it’s a PDF).

            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2471.jpg" alt="IMG_2471.jpg" /> Kathy arrived yesterday to spend the week with us and to help us test and fine-tune a big new feature we’ve been working on for the site.</p>

<p>After picking her up at the airport, we went to <a href="http://www.salumicuredmeats.com/">Salumi</a> (the owner’s son is <a href="http://www.babbonyc.com/mariob2.html">Mario Batali</a>) in Seattle to get some meats, then to <a href="http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/">Pike Place Market</a> for more grocery shopping, <a href="http://www.threedog.com/">Three Dog Bakery</a> for treats for the dogs, then to <a href="http://www.rays.com/">Ray’s Boathouse</a> for dinner.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>As I was riding up our road to the house on my morning bike ride, the FedEx truck came up behind me and followed me to the house and delivered my new Powerbook! It turns out that it was set for a Saturday Delivery so I <em>could</em> have had it two days ago, but FedEx doesn’t do Saturday deliveries on Vashon. (Damn you, Vashon!)</p>
