          </h3>
            <p>One of my biggest pet peeves is having to pay for parking.  As Troy can attest, I am a master at finding a free space rather than having to pay.  It is a stupid principal for a liberal to cling to, especially after reading how <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/216997_parking22.html">we spend more on creating free parking than we do on Medicare in this country</a>.  As of right now, I am relinquishing my need for free.  The more we pay, the more attractive paid parking becomes and the market will take over. </p>

<blockquote>For example, cities typically require the construction of four off-street parking spaces for every 1,000 square feet of office space, Shoup said. Since each parking space takes up about 300 square feet, the net result is 20 percent more space for cars than people, he said. Parking requirements reduce the land available for housing and drive up the cost of housing, Shoup said. </blockquote>

            <p><img src="http://www.transhumanism.org/tv/2003usa/rameznaam.jpg" alt="" />My ex-boss at Microsoft, Ramez Naam, wrote a book, <a href="http://morethanhuman.org/">More Than Human</a>, that was just <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/electronic-paper/internet-on-paper-more-than-human-by-ramez-naam-036652.php">wrote well-reviewed by Gizmodo</a> and reviewed positively by notables such as Steven Johnson, George Dyson and even <a href="http://morethanhuman.org/reviews/#sciam">Scientific American</a>. Congratulations Mez!</p>

<p>Interestingly, and I had forgotten about this til just this second, it was at one of Mez’s parties in 1998 that Gay and I had our first kiss. And our relationship started right after that. Oh, the memories…. :)</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Today is Gay’s 35th birthday. We had a glass of white wine with lunch today, and <a href="http://littlepigrobinson.blogspot.com/">Reid</a> and Marissa joined us for lunch (they had us over for dinner last night at Reid’s father’s place on the island). And we didn’t even eat in the office or at our desks. Maybe I can convince Gay to have a good bottle of wine with dinner tonight. :)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=86520">Dorel</a>, the vigilant birthday wisher, started <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=113424&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0">a Happy Birthday thread</a>, which is always nice to see on your birthday, especially from people who don’t even know you in “real life”.</p>

          </h3>
            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/DVDPlayerScreenSnapz001.jpg" alt="" />Kathy left on Saturday morning after a productive and fun week together. We ate and cooked a lot (and took over 100 photos to prove it!). We planned to watch <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&amp;cf=info&amp;id=1808405432">The Incredibles</a>, but we only got the Extras DVD, so we watched <a href="http://www.miramax.com/quietamerican/">The Quiet American</a>, which was good, even though we all fell asleep at one point or another during it (although that was probably caused more by the wine than the movie).</p>

<p>On Saturday, after returning from the airport, we dropped the movies off at Blockbuster and they gave us the correct DVD for The Incredibles. We watched it that night and loved it! It may be my favorite <a href="http://pixar.com">Pixar</a> movie yet.</p>

<p>I spent the rainy weekend doing a lot of miscellaneous work that I’ve needed to do while Gay, who was running around for weeks without rest, relaxed and went for a 19-mile run Sunday morning.</p>
