          <p>Look this is just plain fraud, and it is evil.  Luckily I know not to trust Paulinus_Pradip@bellsouth.net to be sending me mail on behalf of US Bank (or whomever sent me the one from Citibank last week complete with their logos), but other might not be as discerning:</p>

<p>Bastards.  Spam is one of our biggest problems.  I wish my email client had a way for me to push a button to sue these jerks.</p>
