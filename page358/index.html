            <p>The NY Times has an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/22/travel/escapes/22HOUR.html?ex=1376971200&amp;en=928cc0c36ff68a07&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">article on Seattle</a>. Seattle is great in the summer. The bright blue water with the white boats skimming along with mountain ranges in the background is a beautiful scene. But I actually prefer Seattle in the winter &lt;gasp!&gt;. When everyone else in the country is freezing, the trees are all dead and everyone’s dreading the inevitable snow-in, I can be outside walking, sitting or riding my bike surrounded by pretty green foliage against a grey sky. And all I have to do is put on a light jacket, sweater or fleece and avoid the 10 minutes a day of rain. And if I want to go skiing, there’s a ski resorts just 40 minutes away and one of the <a href="http://www.whistler-blackcomb.com/">best ski resorts in the world</a> just 3 hours away. Oh, and the beer in the Pacific Northwest is plentiful and delicious.</p>

            <p>My dad had a CAT scan and an MRI a couple weeks ago and today confirmed that he has <a href="http://www.hydroassoc.org/">hydrocephalus</a>. He is scheduled to have an operation on September 11 to install a <a href="http://www.hydroassoc.org/newsletter/shunt.html">shunt</a> in his skull to relieve the pressure on his brain.</p>

            <p>In contrast to nice people like Bergy, we recently had a member on the site threaten people with violence! This person even posted postal addresses for some people and implied that “someone” was going to pay them a visit. There are some real whackos in the world!</p>

<p>So now we’re in the process of contacting law-enforcement officials in this person’s area. Fortunately, their ISP is taking this very seriously and is working with us to determine who the person is. So that’s how my day’s going.</p>

<p>I wonder if all recipe web sites have to deal with this type of stuff.</p>
