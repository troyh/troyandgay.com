              <p>Went to the all-new <a href="http://www.nwculture.com/NWC/Islands/VashonIsland/CoffeehousesCafes/SoundFood/sf.html">Sound Food</a> restaurant on the island last night for dinner. I think it was the 2nd best food I’ve had on the island; an island that is severely lacking in good restaurants. We then came home and played a close game of Trivial Pursuit and I won with an unbelievable gimmie question: “Who, after recovering from testicular cancer, wrote a book called <em>It’s not about the bike</em>”. HA ha.</p>

              <p>Every couple of weeks someone else realizes that they have become <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=29600">addicted to Recipezaar</a>.  Not only do folks really get off on our caring community, but they really are cooking better, more, trying new things.  I get so touched when I hear them repeat our motto too “you make Recipezaar a bigger and better place.”</p>

<p>And if that wasn’t all this weekend is the <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=29513">Dana-athon</a>.  Dana is one of our members who is battling brain cancer, and folks around the world are cooking her recipes this weekend as a way to send her good energy.  What a neat idea.  UPDATE: 164 people participated!  I doubt I could get 164 people to cook for me…</p>

              <p>Yesterday I got the final piece to a new 1U server we’re building (<a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> is hungry again for more hardware).</p>

<p>Three problems: 1) the case is missing a fanboard, 2) the <a href="http://www.msicomputer.com/msiforms/k7n2.asp">motherboard</a>’s audio ports are too tall for the 1U case, and 3) a 512MB RAM chip (from Crucial even!) is defective. #1 is the shipper’s fault, #2 is my fault and #3 is just a hardware defect.</p>

<p>In 20 years of tinkering with computers, I’ve never had solid-state hardware just die. But in the last 4 weeks, I’ve had a defective (ASUS) motherboard, a Apple <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/03/001262.php#001262">Combo Drive die</a> and now a RAM chip. Are hardware makers getting sloppy?</p>

              <p>If Saddam Hussein is not linked to al Qaeda (and I don’t think he is), and he has not restarted a nuclear weapons program (which I don’t think he has); then he is really no worse than any other despot out there (which I believe there are many).  We should work hard to remove him from power, because it is the right thing to do, with the help of international support.  I am not against war, but I think it is deplorable that we can’t get do it with the diplomacy and a unified front.  “History will turn, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/08/international/middleeast/08ASSE.html?th">he implied</a>, on what the Council members do now, whether they hang together as a world body or splinter apart in bitter dissent over American war plans in Iraq.”

“Still, inside the Security Council, many diplomats believe that the most important debate is over whether nations should simply bow to America’s will by joining the coalition in hopes of influencing the conduct of the war that Mr. Bush appears poised to unleash. A number of nations seem determined to hold their ground, diplomats report, in the belief that no superpower can function in isolation.”</p>

<p>Has anyone considered how our own economy might be improved if we took the billions we are going to spend on war and spend it at home instead…</p>
