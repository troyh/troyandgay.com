          <p><img src="http://66.199.186.124/archives/09covdv.jpg" alt="BusinessWeek: The  Uprising" />BusinessWeek devoted <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/toc/03_09/B382203.htm">an entire section</a> to linux. Now that BusinessWeek is taking  seriously and understanding open source, maybe all the “open source can’t possibly make money” talk will finally disappear. And the cover art is just about the coolest cover I’ve seen in a long time on any magazine (I hate that stupid <a href="http://www.portlandskate.com/bfly2001.htm">MSN butterfly</a>).</p>

<p>What I don’t think Microsoft truly groks yet is that it’s all about commodities… an operating system, a web server, a database are all commodoties, in general. Yes, there are special cases where you need a specialized OS, web server or database, but 99% of the cases a commoditized version is satisfactory or even preferable. Microsoft is determined to prevent Windows from becoming a commodity, but that’s a futile battle. Microsoft’s revenue from Windows will continue to fall and they will have to become an applications company. Unfortunately for them, they only have one successful application: Office. And that just may <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">become a commodity too</a>.</p>

<p>Sun can already tell you how hard it is to compete with a pricey Solaris against a commodity . And <a href="http://oracle.com">Oracle</a> also will feel the heat from <a href="http://mysql.com">MySQL</a>.</p>

          <p><img src="http://www.michaeljackson.com/images/cvr-silver.jpg" alt="" />Micheal Jackson might be a little strange, but his plastic surgery is his own damn business – he has to live with that nose – and I really don’t believe he  did anything more than sleep in the same bed as those kids.  While he may not the best father (kid out the window), he hires nurses for that job.  He is certainly a great friend of children; mainly because he has not grown up himself.  This documentary guy was out to <a href="http://www.steveharvey.com/michaeljackson.htm">manipulate Jackson just like the father of the kid he settled the sexual abuse case</a>.  Poor Michael.</p>

          <p>Another mention of Recipezaar in a newspaper! The <a href="http://www.sptimes.com">St. Petersburg Times</a> <a href="http://www.sptimes.com/2003/02/19/Taste/Dish.shtml">mentions Recipezaar</a>: <em>Faced with nearly 50,000 recipes (an embarrassment of riches), your biggest problem will be picking one from this voluminous site.

People on special diets will find this site fertile ground, with options for diets of every ilk.</em></p>
