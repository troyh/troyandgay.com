            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>I just installed <a href="http://www.tivo.com/4.9.19.asp">TiVo To Go</a> on my Windows PC. I’m watching an episode of <em>Ebert &amp; Roeper</em> that TiVo recorded last night. Very cool, but I doubt I’ll use it much at all… listening to music is good while working but TV is not. And I can’t even use it to grab screenshots or clips from shows because of the strict DRM that TiVo imposes.</p>

<p>The install was painful, not surprisingly: install WMP10, reboot, find a codec (why does the Mac never use terms like “codec” but Windows uses it like its a household word?!) that you have to find somewhere on the internet, run the install, etc.</p>

<p>And the transfers take forever! A 30-minute show takes 40 minutes to download on a 100Mbps wired network connection. I imagine TiVo streams it slowly so that it can do its other jobs, but I’d think it could transfer at more than 4Mbps that it does. The files are ~600MB; when I copy files to CDs to do backups across the net, it takes 4-5 minutes for the same size file. Maybe because USB on the TiVo is the bottleneck?</p>

<p>WMP10 is the first version of Windows Media Player that looks nice. If this is what Longhorn will look like, Windows will be attractive for the first time. (It’s obviously a copy of OS X’s shiny appearance, but I can’t say that or I’m “religiously anti-Microsoft”, a “Mac zealot” or both).</p>

              <p>One of the most annoying things is that MSN Messenger, the OS X version at least, often gives me this message in a chat:</p>

<p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/dumbmsg.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you don’t know whether Lee will respond or whether Lee is a male or female, why broach the topics? Why not make it simply:</p>

<p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/notdumbmsg.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>I can deduce that Lee may or may not respond. Besides, Lee may or may not respond regardless of whether or not they are away, not <em>because</em> they are away. And I do know whether Lee is a male or female so it’s pointless for Messenger to demonstrate its ignorance about it, especially when it doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>We, on behalf of Recipezaar, just donated to our favorite radio station, <a href="http://kexp.org">KEXP</a>. It’s a public-supported radio station and its what we listen to all day while we sit at our computers every day, we’ve found out about the majority of the music we listen to these days, so we figure we owe them something. And I can’t help but want to support non-corporate music. :)</p>

<p>Yikes, if I knew they’d read the email I sent <em>verbatim</em> I’d have written something more clever or interesting. It probably sounds dumb out of context, but if you heard the entire show they were getting punch drunk after being up for hours during their pledge drive – they’re normally less giggly. <a href="/pix/kexp.wav">Listen to the clip</a>.</p>

              <p>We live in a pretty small and pretty rural area that luckily publishes a weekly paper.  We like to joke that the local high school paper, The Riptide, has a higher standard of journalism than <a href="http://www.vashonbeachcomber.com/">The Beachcomber</a>.  But like all Vashon Islanders, I don’t know what I’d do without the weekly Police Beat.  Example today:</p>

<blockquote>**Sheriff's Log Febuary 8th**:
POT ON THE BUS
Several students riding the bus to Vashon High School complained that one youth was smoking marijuana.  The report doesn't say what action was taken.

<p>I’d love to have a blog where people send in the best in Rural news gems like this.  The following headlne is what inspired the discussion:</p>

<blockquote>**[
It's Never Too Early to Start Talking About Sex With Kids](http://www.vashonbeachcomber.com/portals-code/list.cgi?paper=90&amp;cat=48&amp;id=384088&amp;more=)**
While it is widely recognized that parents are a child’s primary sexuality educator, is it ever too early to begin “sex-ed” lessons? The answer is no.  Even with newborns...</blockquote>
