              <p>We live in a pretty small and pretty rural area that luckily publishes a weekly paper.  We like to joke that the local high school paper, The Riptide, has a higher standard of journalism than <a href="http://www.vashonbeachcomber.com/">The Beachcomber</a>.  But like all Vashon Islanders, I don’t know what I’d do without the weekly Police Beat.  Example today:</p>

<blockquote>**Sheriff's Log Febuary 8th**:
POT ON THE BUS
Several students riding the bus to Vashon High School complained that one youth was smoking marijuana.  The report doesn't say what action was taken.

<p>I’d love to have a blog where people send in the best in Rural news gems like this.  The following headlne is what inspired the discussion:</p>

<blockquote>**[
It's Never Too Early to Start Talking About Sex With Kids](http://www.vashonbeachcomber.com/portals-code/list.cgi?paper=90&amp;cat=48&amp;id=384088&amp;more=)**

<p>But, of course, Apple’s <em>real</em> version looks good:</p>

<p>After <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=2985">our previous surprise mention</a>, the food editor for the Washington Post called to interview us (Gay does all the talking for us, as you’d expect) and the  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62485-2005Mar1.html">the follow-up article</a> on <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> ran in today’s edition:</p>

<p><em>“We wanted to make eating easier through technology,” Gilmore says. Recipezaar.com accomplishes that goal by offering free features such as personalized online cookbooks and automatic shopping lists of ingredients. Often the recipes come with good-quality photos.</em></p>

<p>I grew up in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=2740%20viking%20drive%2C%20herndon%2C%20va%20">the Washington, DC area</a> so it’s nice that my hometown newspaper (finally) recognized me. ;)</p>

              <p><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/mstamper77/CoolStuff%20folder/CoolStuff/">Gui Avoider</a> explains why they are more productive on a Mac. I have to agree, as a long-time Mac-hater (I still think pre-OS X Macs sucked), the first thing that struck me about OS X is that I think about what I’m doing rather than how I’m doing it. Windows and Linux GUIs are both so difficult to use that I find myself struggling with the tool rather than getting the job done. OS X is a pleasure to use, and I don’t say that about many tech products.</p>
