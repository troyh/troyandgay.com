          <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/48874526/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/24/48874526_53f5b0e91b_m.jpg" alt="IMG_1613" /></a>This photo from our honeymoon last year was taken in Jimbaran Bay, where <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/01/AR2005100100624.html?nav=rss_print/asection">today’s Bali bombings</a> took place. Two of the bombs went off down the beach from where we were sitting; if you could see behind Gay, you’d see the line of beach restaurants where the bombs exploded.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this photo was taken Sept 30, 2004, almost the day of the bombings to the day. Scary. Before the honeymoon, I was seriously concerned about terrorism after learning about the nutjob terrorists in Bali. I drove Gay nuts with it, but now she knows I was right. :)  But this incident proves what I learned about the Bali Al-Qaeda group: they’re morons. They bomb things just to do it, with no regard to the political ramifications and without an apparent purpose. They’re the group of Al-Qaeda that wants so hard to belong and get attention, but can’t figure out how to do anything but kill other Muslims. And in the end, they only hurt their own country and their own people, but have absolutely no political gain.</p>

<p>It’s weird, we were here at the place of these Bali bombings and we landed in London the day of the London bombings this year. We need to figure out where to go on vacation that aren’t bombing targets. ;)</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/46818774/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/25/46818774_6fbb509204_m.jpg" alt="IMG_0230.JPG" /></a>We drove to Coeur d’Alene, Idaho Friday morning to attend Gay’s brother’s wedding. Because of <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=3133">Ouzo’s unexpected surgery</a>, we decided to take the dogs with us. We were surprised to find that both hotels we booked weeks ago accepted dogs. One charged $50 extra and the other took a $150 deposit. Pretty fair, considering we have two big dogs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/46819383/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/24/46819383_86af604ad8_m.jpg" alt="IMG_0234.JPG" /></a>We checked into the hotel in Coeur d’Alene, got changed and went to the Hitching Post up the street.  The ceremony was very short, I took a 7-minute video on my camera of almost the whole thing. We then met at The Coeur D’Alene, <em>the</em> resort at the lake, for drinks before dinner. We had dinner at a Chinese restaurant down the street.</p>

<p>Gay’s father and his sisters drove from Spokane Saturday morning to meet us for breakfast. When Gay was a kid, her father took her to the lake to go boating quite a bit. We drove back to Spokane and we all went to the <a href="http://www.alcyontech.com/arborcrest/index.html">Arbor Crest</a> winery in Spokane (who knew Spokane had wineries?!) and tasted some wines.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/46817240/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/25/46817240_d910c11192_m.jpg" alt="IMG_0252.JPG" /></a>We left Gay’s dad and aunts and went to Gay’s mom’s farm, north of Spokane. We spent the afternoon there and even got to see their sheep get sheared. Illy and Ouzo pretended to be herding the sheep.. anytime the sheep got close to the fence, Illy and Ouzo would bark at them and make them run to the other side of the pen.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/46818076/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/30/46818076_4e6a81a1f7_m.jpg" alt="IMG_0253.JPG" /></a>We were tired by then and just wanted to get to our hotel in Spokane and get some dinner. So we dropped the car with the valet, with the dogs inside, and went to dinner at the hotel restaurant. We didn’t want to leave the dogs in the room for fear they’d bark the entire time and disturb the other guests, so they got to sit in the parking garage. The valet was very nice, and very brave considering that they bark like crazy when they’re scared.</p>

<p>Illy does not like elevators, especially ones with slippery floors, so it was always a struggle to get her on the elevators at hotels. She would dig her claws into the carpet outside the elevator and refuse to get on, so I had to push her on while Gay pulled her with the leash. Overall, Illy did not have a fun time traveling (except at the farm), but Ouzo adapted well to it.</p>

A couple days ago, Ouzo tore one of them on his hind leg. So today was his surgery to have his rear duclaws removed. He’s back home and very groggy, which, if you know Ouzo, is strange.</p>

<p>We’ll see how long his bandages last before he chews them off. My guess is that they’re gone tomorrow afternoon.</p>
