              <p>The top European contender for the win, Valverde, crashed yesterday in Stage 3 and broke a collarbone and is out of the race. American Fred Rodriguez crashed too and has abandoned with the same injury.
This leaves Iban Mayo as the top contender against the Americans Hincapie, Landis and Leipheimer. It’s a long race yet, but I’m starting to imagine Americans taking 1, 2 and 3!</p>

              <p>The day before the Tour de France starts, the <a href="http://velonews.com/tour2006/news/articles/10176.0.html">top contenders were ejected from the race</a> after “overwhelming evidence” showed that they were doping. Three of the top 5 from last year are included. The most shocking ejections are Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso, one of which was practically guaranteed to win this year. Basso and Ullrich deny the charges, which is probably expected.
And poor Vinokourov… he left T-Mobile last year because Jan was the captain and now his new team is all but gone from the race and he wasn’t even implicated. If only had had stayed on T-Mobile, he’d be the team leader on probably the winner. He can’t possibly win now. <strong>Update:</strong> He can’t win now because <a href="http://eurosport.com/cycling/tour-de-france/2006/sport_sto917542.shtml">his whole team has been pulled</a>.
On the bright side, this is going to make it much easier on Americans Hincapie, Leipheimer and Landis to get on the podium, if not win it!
It’s great that the UCI is hard-line about anti-doping. If only other sports were as strict.</p>

              <p>On Monday, in yet another <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2144668/?nav=ais">Onion headline come to life, Warren Buffett gave his fortune to Bill Gates</a>.  What Warren Buffett (and the Gates) are doing is admirable.  Their commitment should set a standard to which other very wealthy families are compared. When the second richest man on earth comes out strenuously against repealing the estate tax (because it creates a cycle of dependency, and is the opposite of the meritocratic society) and gets behind those words with action, I hope the country listens.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIU0Jwu54w">Colbert Report</a>: A congressman who sponsored a bill to display the 10 Commandments in a judicial building can’t name a better building than a courtroom to display them (a Church is a <em>worse</em> place to display them?), but more importantly, wants our justice system to follow 10 rules that he doesn’t even know. If he hasn’t even read the 10 Commandments, can we believe he’s read the bill he is trying to push through Congress?</p>

<p>Congress just <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003059851_watch14.html">secretly voted</a> to give themselves another pay-raise, something they’ve done ever year for 7 years, while <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/21/AR2006062101069.html?nav=rss_politics">voting against a minimum-wage increase</a>, something they’ve done every year for 9 years. If we’re paying their salaries, is it too much to ask that they actually spend some time reading the things they endorse?</p>

<p>Argh! I hate politics. Why do I even bother to find something positive  in the political news?</p>
