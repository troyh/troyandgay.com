          <p>I kegged my ESB that “I brewed three weeks ago”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/06/01/brew-day-english-esb/. For the first time ever, I have both of my beer taps with beer. Now I just need someone to drink it all.</p>

<p>“George Carlin died”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/arts/24carlin.html?ex=1229832000&amp;en=1f672e3af00a503d&amp;ei=5087&amp;excamp=GGGNgeorgecarlindied&amp;WT.srch=1&amp;WT.mc_ev=click&amp;WT.mc_id=GN-S-E-GG-NA-S-george_carlin_died yesterday at 71. I remember the first time I saw his standup act on TV. Our family went on vacation to the beach with another family and me and my friend were watching HBO, which was novel to us at the time (mid 1970s). The adults sat down on the couch to watch too, me and my friend were on the floor right in front of the TV. Everything was fine until one joke, when the adults gasped and one of them quickly got up and turned the TV off. I’ll never forget that joke.</p>

<p>Some good Carlin quotes:</p>

<p>bq. I think it’s the duty of the comedian to find out where the line is drawn and cross it deliberately.</p>

<p>bq. Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that.</p>

<p>bq. Religion convinced the world that there’s an invisible man in the sky who watches everything you do. And there’s 10 things he doesn’t want you to do or else you’ll go to a burning place with a lake of fire until the end of eternity. But he loves you! …And he needs money! He’s all powerful, but he can’t handle money!</p>

<p>bq. By and large, language is a tool for concealing the truth.</p>

<p>bq. Death is caused by swallowing small amounts of saliva over a long period of time.</p>

<p>bq. Don’t sweat the petty things and don’t pet the sweaty things.</p>

<p>bq. Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?</p>

<p>bq. Most people work just hard enough not to get fired and get paid just enough money not to quit.</p>

<p>bq. Scratch any cynic and you’ll find a disappointed idealist.</p>

<p>bq. People who say they don’t care what people think are usually desperate to have people think they don’t care what people think.</p>

<p>bq. Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach him how to fish, and he will sit in a boat and drink beer all day.</p>

<p>bq. Here’s a bumper sticker I’d like to see: “We are the proud parents of a child whose self-esteem is sufficient that he doesn’t need us promoting his minor scholastic achievements on the back of our car.”</p>

<p>bq. Thou shalt keep thy religion to thyself.</p>

<p>bq. I’m always relieved when someone is delivering a eulogy and I realize I’m listening to it.</p>

<p>bq. I wanna live. I don’t wanna die. That’s the whole meaning of life: Not dying! I figured that shit out by myself in the third grade.</p>

<p>bq. Life is a zero sum game.</p>

<p>We took Havana to the “Woodland Park Zoo”:http://www.zoo.org today. She wasn’t much interested in the animals, though, she just stared at them. I guess she’s still too young. After the park, we tried to go to the “74th Street Ale House”:http://www.seattlealehouses.com/74th/default.htm which is just down the street from the Zoo, but no one under 21 is allowed in (idiotic law). So we went to “Tangletown”:http://www.elysianbrewing.com/tangletown.html, one of “Elysian Brewery’s”:http://www.elysianbrewing.com/ three restaurants, for a mediocre dinner.</p>

          <p>My Imperial Stout is pretty good. It has a chocolatey taste, which you’d expect in a stout, but also has a slight cherry taste.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Technically, this is my second Father’s Day but Havana was only 6 weeks old at the time. This feels like my first one and I was looking forward to it. And the weather was great, all weekend was beautiful. Gay and Havana woke me up and Havana had put her “I Love Daddy” shirt in honor of Father’s Day and gave me a bag of gifts. I got three books to read to Havana and an “Amazon Kindle”:http://amazon.com/kindle! I spent the day in the hammock in the sun reading on the Kindle and finished the afternoon with a “Lagunitas IPA”:http://www.lagunitas.com/beers/ipa.html, one of my favorite IPAs.</p>

<p>The Kindle is a great device. I agree with a lot of the reviews that mention its design flaws. The screen is easy to read and can be read in direct sunlight. It’s light enough to hold for long periods of time and can hold lots of books, 200 supposedly. That alone makes it an improvement over books. All in all, I highly recommend it.</p>

<p>For dinner, we had barbecued <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/menu/18525">Rib Eye steaks with chimchurri sauce, garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed corn</a></p>

<p>The wine was a 2005 “PlumpJack”:http://www.plumpjackwinery.com/plumpjackwinery/ Cabernet that we got “while in Napa Valley”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/13/napa-valley/. For dessert, we had a homemade strawberry shortcakes with whipped cream while watching “Talk To Me”:http://movies.nytimes.com/2007/07/13/movies/13talk.html.</p>
