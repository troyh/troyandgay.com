            <p>The ferry ride is only 15 minutes.  <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/transportation/118119_needles18.html">Apparently there are problems with needles on the ferries so they have installed biohazard disposals in the bathrooms</a>.  I suppose if you have diabetes you migh appreciate this, but I have to assume that you are probably very responsible with your biohazards already.  If you are doing <em>other</em> drugs will you really take the time?  Why do the ferries need this when I have not seen such a disposal in a public restroom outside of a hospital EVER.  Perhaps I’m a little sensitive since they are cutting back our service due to budgets already and now I find out they spent time and money on this.  Noteably the article mentions there are 1,000 ferry workers and 68,000 riders.  1 worker to every 68 riders sure seems like a heck of a lot to me…</p>

            <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/450history_recession.jpg" alt="" />Found some cool old photos on the [](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/historypostcards/)Seattle Times website.  This has always a legendary Seattle saying from the recession, one that came up again at the dot com crash and every time Boeing has layoffs.</p>

            <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/raccoon.jpg" alt="raccoon.jpg" /> The dogs went nuts at 4am. They refused to shutup so I turned on the light on the back deck and saw nothing. Then a huge <a href="http://www.loomcom.com/raccoons/">raccoon</a> ran by the door! I guess the dogs don’t like raccoons. Anyway, I layed awake thinking about how to improve the caching mechanism on Recipezaar, and at 6:30 just decided to get out of bed. Of course, the dogs thought it was breakfast time. I explained it wasn’t and they went back to bed and probably fell asleep within 30 seconds. Stupid dogs.</p>

<p>I reassembled a new server we’re building because the fan noise was driving me nuts all day yesterday. Need to go make some coffee…</p>
