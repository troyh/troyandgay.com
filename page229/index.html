Good news, considering we will be vacationing in France with <a href="http://www.hakalas.com/">my brother</a>, his wife and his kids, so I can <em>finally</em> see some stages of the Tour. I met Lance way back in 1994 at the beginning of Stage 2 of the (now defunct) Tour DuPont, which he won, maybe I can get his autograph this time. :)</p>

<p>Now we have to research the route and plan the stages we want to see.</p>

<blockquote>This is adware.  Google is pushing its advertising into content it does not own.  Why not just parse the page and replace the banner ads the content provider is running with Google banners?  This boils down to invasive marketing by an increasingly unscrupulous company.  The pressures of justifying a $50 billion valuation are showing...</blockquote>

<p>I think he’s right. The largest (only?) part of Google’s biz model is based on selling ads on content it doesn’t own. That’s unlikely to succeed simply because they’d be alienating the very people they depend on. This’ll be interesting, Google has a way of not being stupid.</p>
