    <p>After going into Seattle this morning, we went in again this evening for Stephanie &amp; Matt’s house-warming party. I haven’t gone into Seattle twice in the same day since the day we moved to Vashon and had to make a few trips back to the old house.</p>

<p>We were one of the first to get to the party and the first to leave at 11pm and raced to catch the 11:40 ferry. We barely made it but had we missed it we would have been taking the 1:50am ferry and would have gotten home at 2:30am. The ferries suck.</p>
