  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Today is my 12th anniversary of living in Seattle, and one year exactly since my “11th-year anniversary”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/03/11-years-in-seattle/. 12 years is a long enough time to live in one place so I’ve been thinking about finding a new place to live to see what that’s like. Because I’ve been thinking about it and talking about it, Gay’s been thinking about it too. For some reason I have yet to figure out, she wants to continue to live with me.</p>

<p>The East Coast is out because I lived there for far too long (26 years) and it’s a god-awful place: year-round lousy weather and too crowded. The Midwest is less crowded, but for a good reason. The Southwest is too dry and hot. Alaska and Hawaii are too remote.</p>

<p>That leaves the West Coast. Northern California would be great but it’s too expensive in the San Francisco area and you can’t get lots of acreage anywhere around there for less than many millions, so I’d have to live north of San Francisco. Unfortunately, there’s no desirable place to live north of Napa Valley, which is still very expensive (and lacks nice views, IMO). Oregon would be great, especially the Portland area. It’s a beer, wine and coffee town, it’s less expensive than Seattle and you can get sizable land for reasonable prices but still be fairly close to Portland.</p>

<p>But then I remember where I live. We have 4 acres with a view you can’t get in many places around the world, let alone the US. Seattle’s a great city and, while the ferries are annoying, it’s relatively easy to get into the city. And we can remodel this house to fix its problems for much much cheaper than it would be to buy a house anywhere (which would also require a remodel).</p>

<p>But then again, I haven’t seriously considered any other countries. It’d be great to give the kids an experience of living in another country. Although they wouldn’t fully appreciate it until they’re 10 years old or so.</p>
