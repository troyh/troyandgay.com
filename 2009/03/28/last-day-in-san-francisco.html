  <div class="post-content">
    <p>After a week I’ve realized that San Francisco is not a beer town, despite being the birthplace for American craft brewing. Grocery stores have a very limited beer selection, far more limited than even Vashon’s Thriftway, and restaurants have only a handful of beers on tap, most of which are mainstream beers. And if you do want beer you’d better not have kids because the beer bars don’t allow kids.</p>

<p>We drove around San Francisco for a while and then, on the recommendation from the hotel concierge, went to “Izzy’s Steak House”:http://www.izzyssteaks.com/.</p>

<p>Fortunately, of the five beers on tap, Izzy’s had Denogginizer, a double IPA from “Drake’s Brewing”:http://www.drinkdrakes.com/home.html, a small brewer from California that I’ve never even heard of. I ordered that and it was very good.</p>

<p>We went back to the hotel and stopped at the Ghirardelli ice cream shop in <a href="http://www.ghirardellisq.com/ghirardellisq/food.php?id=16">Ghirardelli Square</a> for some ice cream for Havana, which made her very excited. She had two small spoons of it and didn’t want any more. Go figure.</p>
