    <p>On Wednesday morning, Illy was slow to eat her breakfast. That’s odd for Illy, she’ll knock small children over to get to food. Then I let her out to go to the bathroom and she had trouble walking a straight line. She refused to come back inside and slowly walked around the yard. We didn’t think much of it until noon when she hadn’t come back in. We found her laying behind a row of <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=hydrangeas&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=fv27SebOHoKEsAOSwKQ2&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=title">hydrangeas</a> and she refused to get up. We eventually coaxed her up and she couldn’t walk without falling down, so I carried her inside and up to her bed to rest. She made her way out into the hallway but couldn’t go any further so she just layed down for hours.</p>

<p>At this point, we figured she had hurt her hips as older Labradors tend to do. She’s had both knees replaced, another common problem with her breed, so we knew her knees weren’t the problem. She’s fell down before and had similar, although less severe, symptoms and she always recovered. The problem with dogs is that they just don’t tell you what’s bothering them. She wouldn’t eat or drink water. She wouldn’t even eat her favorite treat, which has never happened with Illy.</p>

<p>By Thursday she was worse, she couldn’t walk or stand at all and I had to carry her outside to go to the bathroom. It didn’t make sense that she’d get worse over time, so we called the vet Friday morning. They said that it sounds like she has “sudden dizziness” and that it’s very common among older dogs of all breeds. I’d never heard of such a thing. The vet said that it just goes away after a few days. Sure enough, by Friday evening she was getting better. She still couldn’t walk a straight line very well and she’s slow but she didn’t need to be carried around anymore.</p>

<p>This morning, she could stand up on her own and walk outside, go to the bathroom and come back in all by herself. She’s still slightly wobbly and very tentative about walking. Hopefully, by tomorrow she’ll continue to improve.</p>
