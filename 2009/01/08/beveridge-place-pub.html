    <p>Gay and I went to “Beveridge Place Pub”:http://www.beveridgeplacepub.com/ for a rare date night, only the second time we’ve left Hudson at home. We’ve driven by it for years and never felt tempted to go in, but ever since discovered that it’s a highly-regarded beer place we’ve been trying to get a chance to go. Hours before we left, I checked their web site to see what beers they have on tap (they don’t list them, unfortunately) and realized that they don’t serve food at all. Instead, they provide a set of local restaurants that will deliver to the pub. That doesn’t make for such a nice date night, but we decided to not change our plans and we went anyway. I’m glad we did.</p>

<p>I agree with the general consensus, this is a great beer bar. They have 18 taps of mostly Washington and Oregon beers. It’s a very casual place, a very English-style pub with various styles of furniture and a couple couches.</p>

<p>I was happy to find out they had three bourbon barrel-aged beers: Schooner Exact Hoppy the Woodsman (a tiny West Seattle brewery), Issaquah’s Quad Frog and “Pike’s Entire”:http://beernews.org/2008/11/pike-entire-wood-aged-stout-drops-this-monday/ (7% ABV%), a beer I’ve been looking for for a while now, so that’s what I ordered. Gay got the Schooner Exact Hoppy the Woodsman. I really liked the Pike Entire, but it was slightly too oak-flavored and not hoppy enough for me. I’d pick The Abyss over this one if I had a choice (apparently, last week they had The Abyss on tap too!).</p>

<p>We ordered pizza from Pagliacci and waited while we finished our beers. For our second round, I got Full Sail’s “Wreck the Halls”:http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/5316/7200 (6.5% ABV) winter seasonal and, to try the last of the bourbon barrel beers, I ordered the Quad Frog (13.5% ABV) for Gay. She preferred the Wreck the Halls and I preferred the Quad Frog, so we switched. I thought the Quad Frog tasted a lot like Menage-a-Frog that we got “at the Rogue brewpub in Oregon”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/01/11/drive-to-cannon-beach-oregon/ last January. It turns out that it’s in the same family, brewed by Rogue only in their Issaquah brewpub (not sure why they didn’t label it as a Rogue beer).</p>

<p>Ordering food from another restaurant for delivery to a pub is a first for me. I’m not sure I’d go there again for dinner, but it’s a great place to stop in to find a great unique craft beers.</p>
