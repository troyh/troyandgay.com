    <p>Steelers owner and Obama supporter Dan Rooney and his son “gave Obama the game ball”:http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09021/943199-66.stm?cmpid=steelers.xml from the AFC Championship game:</p>

<p>bq. “He’s a [Chicago] Bears fan first, he admits that,” Dan Rooney said yesterday at the Steelers’ UPMC training center. “But he’s a Steelers’ fan. He’s said it, and all his staff, they’re rooting for us [in the Super Bowl].” … While Dan Rooney knew the Kennedys and was particularly close with Bobby Kennedy, he said he never has been as close with a president as he is with Obama, whom he calls a friend.</p>

<p>I wish I was President so I could get a Steelers game ball.</p>
