    <p>The Steelers <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09012/941276-66.stm?cmpid=steelers.xml">beat the Chargers</a> to go to the Championship game against the Ravens.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/images/200901/20000112pd_steel1_330.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Ravens was the one team I was hoping would lose during the playoffs because I think the Steelers could beat any of the other teams. They can beat the Ravens too, and did twice this year, but the Ravens will be tough.</p>

<p>The Steelers were the only team this weekend who was favored to win that did win, the only home team to win and the only team with a bye week last week to win. And it ended up not mattering that they were the #2 seed and not the #1 seed because, thanks the Titans losing, they get to play at home through the playoffs.</p>
