    <p>Steve and Renuka, sans kids, and Eric came over for a Christmas dinner. Eric just returned from his trip around the world that <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/27/erics-around-the-world-trip/">he started in August 2008</a> and we last saw him, as a surprise, <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/05/21/eric-in-london/">in London earlier this year</a>. He came back the US a few days before Christmas and is staying at his parents in Bellingham. He came down for dinner with us and spent the night.</p>

<p>Dinner was great, as Gayâ€™s dinner always are, and Steve and I drank too much and both had hangovers the next day.</p>
