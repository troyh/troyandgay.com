  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Hudson has finally learned to walk all by himself. Once<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4052544481/"> he figured out how to stand up by himself</a>, he just started walking everywhere. I donâ€™t want to get into the habit of comparing the two, but Havana was walking before her first birthday so Hudson took two months longer. Part of this is that boys just develop more slowly than girls but Havana got a lot more attention and encouragement to walk from both of us since there was no older sibling to compete with for time and attention.</p>
