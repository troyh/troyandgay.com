    <p>The AP Mobile iPhone app has a cool feature to alert you for important breaking news. Unfortunately, they generally use it for <em>unimportant</em> news. At 4:46am Pacific Time, the AP decided I needed to know that the Olympic Committee approved golf as an event in the 2016 Olympics. In other words, the AP thinks I can’t wait even a couple hours until I wake up to find this out. Even if I was a golfer hoping to enter the Olympics in golf in 7 years and I’d been hoping this day would come all my life, I could have waited until I woke up to learn about this news.</p>
