  <article class="post-content">
    <p>When we had <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/05/18/mark-lee/">dinner with Mark and Lee</a> earlier this week, they suggested dinner on Thursday and Lee arranged for his niece Aimee to babysit Havana and Hudson so we could go out for a nice dinner. Mark and Aimee arrived out our apartment at 6:30pm and we buzzed them in. Havana and Gay waited at the door while Havana asked “Where’s Uncle Mark?” and suddently Eric popped up the stairs!</p>

<p>The last we heard from Eric he was in India on <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/27/erics-around-the-world-trip/">his around the world trip</a>, we hadn’t heard from him in many weeks and hadn’t seen him in over 10 months, so it was quite a surprise. Mark took some video of Gay’s face which I’m looking forward to seeing. When he heard through Mark that we were going to be in London, he decided to take a detour on his trip and come visit London and spend a few weeks in Europe.</p>

<p>After giving Aimee the rundown on the kids while we waited for Lee to arrive, we took a walk across Hyde Park into Kensington. The weather is perfect these days and it was a nice almost-sunset walk through the Park. They took us to <a href="http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/pubsandbars/the-prince-regent-review-18040.html">The Prince Regent</a> gastropub for dinner.</p>

<p>After dinner, we walked around Kensington for a while and then took a cab back to Mayfair for a beer at one of our neighborhood pubs.</p>
