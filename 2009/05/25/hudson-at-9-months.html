    <p>Hudson’s 9 months old today. He’s starting to learn to crawl and can push himself backwards easily but not forwards. In the last few days he’s started to work on getting up on his knees but hasn’t yet figured out that he should move his knees and hands forward. He can take a few steps if you hold his hands in the air and he can stand by himself against furniture for a few minutes until he falls. He’s continuing to develop his lungs and can be very loud when he wants to be. He has successfully put food into his mouth, but still prefers that someone else do it for him. He can sit up on his own very well at this point but will often fall over, much to his surprise. Minutes after this photo was taken, he did a face-plant right into the street.</p>
