    <p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3335/3531238317_5eaf659279_m.jpg" alt="Gay on bridge" />Iâ€™m training to run the <a href="http://www.rnrseattle.com/">Seattle RocknRoll Marathon</a> June 27th with my friends Laura &amp; Megan.  It has been <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2006/04/17/recent-history-inn-at-langley-whidbey-marathon/">years since I ran</a> a <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2005/06/08/3091/">marathon</a>, so it is like starting over.  My first long run over 10 miles actually happened on our San Fransisco trip, when I ran along the waterfront and across the Golden Gate bridge and back.  I was surprised to learn the bridge is two miles long.  I love the bridge.  It is gorgeous architecturally, and the orange color makes it stand out against the city on the south side and the green rolling hills on the north. It is dorky to say, but crossing the bridge on foot was exhilarating.  One of the best running experiences of my life.  Tomorrow I am aiming for 19 miles.</p>
