    <p>Amazon updated the Kindle, so Gay finally got her very own. I “got mine”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/07/07/kindle-review/ for Father’s Day and Gay got hers for Valentine’s Day, I guess.</p>

<p>I wish this was the Version 1.0 model, mine looks like a device from the 1970s compared to Kindle 2. They fixed the most annoying things that Kindle 1 had, improved the screen and made it much thinner and more comfortable to hold.</p>

<p>We can even share books that we each buy between our Kindles. Hopefully we can stop collecting piles of books around the house and stop buying and building bookshelves!</p>
