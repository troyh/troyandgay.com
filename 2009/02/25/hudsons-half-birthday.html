  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Hudson is 6 months old today. Gay and Havana made him half a cake (that he can’t eat) to celebrate.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3311379659/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3631/3311379659_15fb95b938.jpg" alt="IMG_3076.JPG" /></a></p>

<p>The next 6 months should be a lot more interesting than his first six which consists of a regular cycle of sleeping, crying, eating, crying, diaper-changes, crying.To be fair, Hudson cries very little.</p>

<p>In the next six months he should be crawling, eating regular food, jabbering, learning to walk with the help of furniture and maybe even be walking on his own (“Havana was walking before her first birthday”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/04/16/havana-walking/).</p>
