    <p>Steve and Renuka and their kids, Owen (5) and Claire (3), came over for dinner tonight. We grilled beef satays and a salmon on the bbq, Gay made an orzo and cucumber salad and homemade ice cream for dessert.</p>

<p>It’s cute to see Havana playing with other kids, she starts off shy but has so much fun and has a smile on her face the entire time. Hudson had fallen off the chair in the kitchen minutes before they arrived and cut his lip, scuffed his nose pretty badly and there was lots of blood – the worst injury he’s had yet. He was fine and not crying 30 minutes later, but his fat lip sure stuck out and his nose still looks bad.</p>
