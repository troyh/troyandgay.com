    <p>Contador showed how inexperienced he is today. The Schleck brothers attacked and Contador and his teammate Kloden followed. They were ahead of the peloton by minutes and Contador suddenly attacked with 2km to go on the final climb. He had nothing to gain, the Schlecks were a few minutes behind him on the GC and they werenâ€™t gaining any time on him since he was right there with them. His attack ended up dropping Kloden, not the Schlecks! The Schleck brothers ended the stage gaining significant time and put them in 2nd and 3rd place overall, knocking Kloden and Lance out of the top three positions. Stupid stupid mistake.</p>
