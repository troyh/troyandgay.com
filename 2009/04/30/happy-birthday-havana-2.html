    <p>Havana turned 2 today. She made her own pancakes for breakfast and she helped mom make and ice her cake. She talked to all the grandparents on Skype in the afternoon and then she opened her presents. When she opens presents, she has to play with each one after she opens it rather than, like I did, open them all at once. So by the time she was ready to open her big present, which we knew would distract her for hours, it was getting late so we decided to have dinner and cake and let her open it the next morning. She was fine with that.</p>

<p>I think I set a personal record: 342 photos.</p>
