              <p>Gay surprised me with a very nice new bicycle for our <a href="https://troyandgay.com/2014/07/27/10th-anniversary/">10th Wedding Anniversary</a>. Havana and Hudson just haven’t been interested in bicycling but my getting a new bike seemed to have sparked a new interest so I’ve spent the last couple days riding bikes with them.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Yesterday, bike-less Gay walked Barley with Eva on her balance bike while me, Havana and Hudson rode bikes ahead for a long time. They were still using training wheels but I had taken one side off so they could practice without falling too often. They both were so confident in their abilities that they decided they didn’t need the other training wheel either and begged me to take it off too. So I did. </p>

<p>Today, I took Havana out to practice for the first time without training wheels. She immediately wanted her training wheels back on. I kept encouraging her and we went many blocks while I held  onto her seat and ran alongside her (and it was hot today, not easy!). She was scared but did have a few spans where she didn’t need my help and I showed her that I had let go – which caused her to get scared and start to fall, of course. Once home, she bragged to mom, Hudson and Eva that she “did it by herself”, for a few seconds at least. She can’t yet grasp that she needs to turn the wheel to stop herself from falling — that’s completely counter-intuitive to a 7 year-old. </p>

<p>I think another solid day of practicing and she’ll get it. And now I need to help Hudson, who seems farther along with his confidence, probably inspired by the Tour de France last month, but we’ll see if it’s real.</p>

              <p>Today is our 10th wedding anniversary. It kinda snuck up on us, no big plans, trip or getaway or anything, just dinner at <a href="http://canlis.com/">Canlis</a>. </p>

<p>What’s happened in our marriage in the last 10 years since our wedding day:</p>

<p>Honeymoon in Bali
Trip to France
Sold our company
Had a daughter, Havana
Had a son, Hudson 
Bought a house and renovated it for a year
Had a daughter, Eva
Starting a new business</p>

<p>A lot can happen in 10 years. Fortunately, it’s been good! Optimistically looking forward to the next 10…</p>

              <p>It was one of the most exciting first weeks of a Tour, but once Froome and Contador crashed out and abandoned, the winner was all but set and it became a race for 2nd place. And Americans Talansky and (Tacoma, WA native) Van Garderen had tough races, although finishing 5th is still good. But I’m sad to see it over nevertheless. </p>

<p>Nibali was a great winner, attacking even with a commanding lead already. It was an impressive victory and Nibali is one of only 6 people to win all 3 Grand Tours. Hard to believe his coach <a href="http://www.cyclingquotes.com/news/vinokourov_criticizes_nibali_in_internal_letter/">wrote him a letter this year</a> telling him he’s disappointed.</p>
