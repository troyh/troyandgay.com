          <p>I finally got around to making frames for the movie posters for each of us. Gay’s turn, she will paint them. Then we can hang them in the theater room. </p>

<p>Hudson is still too young to fully understand football and he only watched the game occasionally. But he started to understand the game (first downs, touchdowns, penalties, etc.) much more this year. Next year should be interesting. Havana and Eva couldn’t care less. But Havana did want to wear Seahawks clothes to school today and she had me put blue and green paint in hers and Hudson’s hair before school.</p>

<p>This is only the second sports championship for Seattle, and the other champion from 1979 is not even here anymore. Paul Allen deserves a lot of credit for buying the Seahawks and putting a great organization together, he does a lot for Seattle.</p>

<p>I love great defensive games and this Super Bowl was the most-dominant performance by a defense that I’ve ever seen. Every single offensive play was a struggle for the Broncos. It was fun to watch.</p>

<p>These Seahawks remind me a lot of the great Steelers teams: strong defenses and a slow, plodding offense.  Fans love to see the 50-yard touchdown-passing offenses, Peyton Manning-style, but I’d argue those are the worst offenses because they score too quickly and put the other team’s offense back on the field. It’s better to consistently get first downs and keep the clock ticking. If they maintain this and don’t lose a lot of coaches to new head-coaching jobs, they could win 2 or 3 more Super Bowls in the next 5 years. But the only thing harder than getting to a Super Bowl is getting there again.</p>

          <p>I’m a Steelers fan more than a Seahawks fan, but Hudson is a Seahawks fan. I’m excited that “his team” is in the Super Bowl, hopefully he’ll get to watch many more, like I have had with the Steelers (more Super Bowl wins than anyone…. Go Steelers!). I’m also hopeful that the Seahawks win this one so the fans can stop blaming the refs of the 2005 Super Bowl when the Seahawks lost to the Steelers. It’s also nice to be in a city again that is so excited about their football team. It should be a fun 2 weeks around here.</p>

<p>Who had big days yesterday? These two, that’s who!:</p>

<p>Is the 2015-2016 Super Bowl really going to be called “Super Bowl L”? I hope they call it either “Super Bowl 50” or break the rules of Roman numerals and call it “Super Bowl XXXXX”.</p>

        <article>
          <p>The school called Gay this morning and told her to pick Hudson up because he fell and cut his chin. He’s the “Big Cheese” this week in school and he tripped and fell on the Big Cheese chair, of all things. Gay took him to Children’s Hospital. On the way, he was worried that he’d get blood on his Steelers pants and that “stitches” meant they’d use a sewing machine on him.  He got 11 stitches, but is feeling much better tonight, giddy from the pain-killer, in fact. </p>

<p>This is his 2nd case of stitches (<a href="http://troyandgay.com/2010/03/11/hudsons-first-stitches/">his first</a> was almost 4 years ago). Havana has had 1. Eva zero, so far. Me, zero in 44 years (knock on wood). They must’ve inherited an aptitude for injury from Gay.</p>
