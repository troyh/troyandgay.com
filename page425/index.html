            <p><a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> broke the 10,000 barrier on <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details?q=recipezaar&amp;p=DestSearch_W_t_40_M1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.recipezaar.com%2F">Alexa</a>! We’re now at 9,610. This means that if you ranked all the web sites in popularity, we’re the 9,610th most popular site. Not bad for a couple geeks banging away on computers above their garage, and considering that there are zillions of sites on the web. :)</p>

<p>Of course, this is just one web ranking system and no ranking system is perfectly accurate, so it must be taken with a pinch of salt. But it’s as good a metric as any. I also love that we have a great 5-star review rating on Alexa, more total reviews and more 5-stars than any of our competitors.</p>

            <p><a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/03/03/14/1534218.shtml?tid=95">10 years ago today</a> the first web browser, <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">NCSA</a>’s <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Divisions/Communications/MosaicHistory/history.html">Mosaic</a>, was announced. I wish I could remember the first time I browsed the web, but I don’t think I was on the web til later in ‘93 or probably even ‘94. I probably said something like “big deal, it’s just a glorified <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/T/Telnet.html">telnet</a>, <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/G/Gopher.html">gopher</a> and <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/F/Ftp.html">ftp</a>”. :)  I do remember setting up my own web server running on my desktop machine at work, which was connected directly to the internet <strong>without a firewall</strong>. Those were the days before internet crime.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738206083/recipezaar-20"><img src="http://a1055.g.akamai.net/f/1055/1401/5h/images.barnesandnoble.com/images/5260000/5267596.gif" alt="" />Just finished “Smart Mobs” by Howard Rheingold</a>.  The title is clever (and will likely become a meme) but I don’t think it accurately describes the book.  That said, he takes a broad stroke and effectively mixes sociology, economics, anthropology, politics and computer science in an attempt to explain the changes in our culture brought about by new technology (mainly wireless, but I think it is limiting to focus on that).  It has been a while since I have read a book that adeptly quotes some of my favorite thinkers (Horkeimer, Adorno, Lessig, Foucault, Hobbes…).  Review continues…

The basic understanding of Smart Mobs: “Location-sensing wireless organizers, wireless networks, and community supercomputing collectives all have one thing in common: They enable people to act together in ways and in situations where collective action was not possible before.”  I believe Recipezaar fits in the latter group.</p>

<p>Everyone talks about the SMS- and IM-kids, but Reingold gets to the interesting socialogical aspect:  the type of conversation has not only changed from real exchange to simple ‘ex tempore’ comments, but the shift is in the fact that they live their lives with others in real time, it is the feeling of a “continuously shared life”.</p>

<p>Other quotes I draw inspiration for Recipezaar from:</p>

<p>“What do people gain from virtual communitues that keeps them sharing information with people they might never meet face to face?”
Smith’s (a guy in MSFT Research I met and liked) answer was “social network capital, knowledge capital, and communion”  – people can put a little of what they know and how they feel into the online network and draw out larger amounts of knowledge and opportunities for sociability than they put in.  …
“Whenever a communication medium lowers the costs of solving collective action dilemmas, it becomes possible for more people to pool resources.  And ‘more people pooling resources in new ways’ is the history of civilization. …
“Monitoring and sanctioning is important not simply as a way of punishing rule-breakers but also as a way of assuring people that others are doing their part.  Many people are contingent cooperators, willing to cooperate as long as most others do. …
“Social pressure, for insult to incarceration, to make good on debts or obligations helps communities maintain the essential collective good of trust.”  Reputation, whether maintained by gossip, ritual behavioral displays, credit bureaus, or online reputations servers, appears to be one of teh means by which people negotiate the daty-to-day dance of self-interest and public goods.”</p>

<p>on napster: “What a peer-to-peer network can do is provide a commons where the sheep shit grass, where every user provisions the resource he consumes.”</p>

            <p>I flatted twice yesterday on my bike ride due to a worn rear tire. So this morning I swapped the (less-worn) front tire for the rear, opened the garage and it was pouring down rain. Still haven’t put the fenders on my bike, so no ride today unless it clears up later. I hate when weather controls your life.</p>

            <p>We moved 18 months ago to a new house and never bought any furniture to furnish it until very recently. Back in early December, we were lucky enough to find 4 chairs we liked while we were in NYC, so we bought ‘em. One arrived months ago and the 2nd one arrived today! We still have two more coming in the next few months if we’re lucky. Advice: be careful about buying furniture from <a href="http://www.abchome.com/">ABC Carpet &amp; Home</a> and if you do, <strong>do not</strong> have <a href="http://www.ukaydelivery.com/">UKay</a> ship it!</p>
