              <p>After we realized that <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/10/001779.php#001779">Netflix sent us the wrong DVD</a>, I went to their web site and reported it (they have a way to do that) and I even checked the box on the white sleeve that says that the wrong DVD was sent and mailed it back.</p>

<p>Then I get an email message from them telling me that <em>I</em> mistakenly sent <em>them</em> the wrong DVD in the sleeve! I did both things they ask us to do, and they still get it wrong. There’s no way to telephone them, so I submitted a customer service form on their site explaining it. I then get another email today telling me that they understand what happened and that I should send the movie back as soon as possible. I don’t know how to explain something so simple to them.</p>

<p>I also find it odd that they don’t even bother to make it up to me. Sending me the wrong DVD is their fault. You’d think they’d credit my account 50¢ or do something nice since they screwed up. And they don’t even add the movie I missed automatically to my queue, so when I sent the DVD back, I’d get the right movie again. Nope, I have to add it myself and the next 3 movies on my queue were immediately sent out instead of the one that I actually had higher in my queue.</p>

But what’s worse is that now we discover that they made $1.5 million from people who fell for it! There are some really really really gullible people in the world.</p>
