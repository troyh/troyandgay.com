              <p>Back in August or September it took us quite a while to design a staircase in the garage that would still let us put a car as big as the Jeep in it. We figured out a design that gave us inches to spare above the hood. It also places you right between the cars rather than on one side of one car. Amazingly enough, what worked on paper also worked in reality.</p>

<p>However, we’ll always have to measure any car we want to buy in the future and park in this spot to make sure it fits. </p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>While reading about audio equipment to buy for the new house, I browsed across the <a href="http://hometheaterreview.com/home-theater-reviewss-2010-best-of-home-theater-awards/?page=2">Best of 2010</a> list from hometheaterreview.com and saw that they gave Noble Fidelity the award for best in-wall speakers. I’d never heard of the company and had already ordered speakers from Klipsch and Definitive Technology to try. I emailed them asking for a dealer in Seattle and got a response from Gregory Ford, I believe the, or an, owner of the company, said they don’t have a Seattle dealer but will sell direct to me with a no-questions-asked return policy so I can try them out. They even paid the shipping charges both ways! I couldn’t resist, so I took him up on the offer and ordered a pair of L-85 in-ceiling speakers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5416686417/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5132/5416686417_0d3182b30b.jpg" alt="Noble Fidelity L-85" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->
<p>I was pretty confident that I’d like the Klipsch the best and Definitive Technology is so highly-regarded that I thought they might give the Klipsch a good run for their money. Once I had them all, I installed them in 15”x15” fake walls that I built and hooked them up to my office receiver. All were good speakers, but the Noble Fidelity speakers surprised me. I felt like the Noble Fidelitys were slightly more spatial than the others, but it was too close to call and varied by the music I played; classical, jazz and vocal-centric music (Johnny Cash covering Nine Inch Nails’ “Hurt” is amazing) were clearly better on the Noble Fidelity speakers, but the others did just as well on rock. I couldn’t decide, so I decided to take them to the house to listen to them where they’ll be installed. It’s good that the fake walls I made were small and could fit in the car!</p>

<p>Greg asked me what speakers I was comparing them to and how I was testing them. I took a photo of the installation walls I built and sent it to him. He wanted to talk by phone, so I called him. He thought the boxes I made were too small by a factor of 4 and said that his speakers wouldn’t show off their bass enough. He wanted me to build bigger boxes and gave me a quick tutorial on the physics of sound. He had his engineer talk to me too but his engineer thought the boxes I built would be good enough, at least to compare apples-to-apples against the other speakers. He suggested that I could even put insulation or pillow-filling in the box to simulate a bigger baffle – he also tried to explain the physics of sound to me, but physics is too hard on my little brain. Greg sent me plans for a bigger box and where to mount the speaker in it.</p>

<p>I decided to stick with the boxes I already built so as not to give the Noble Fidelity speakers an unfair advantage. And I was too lazy to build 6 more boxes! Actually, at the house, I decided to build a 2’x3’ box since it was so easy with the tools available – a few cuts with a saw and a few nails with a nail gun – but I haven’t yet tried installing the speakers in the box to see if it made a difference.</p>

<p>I took the speakers to the house, set them up in the living room, hooked up my iPod to my receiver and, <em>wow</em>, what a difference! The Noble Fidelitys sounded wonderful. Gay said she felt like she was wearing a nice pair of headphones. In that room, in comparison to the Noble Fidelitys, the Klipsch sounded like the music was coming from tin cans and the Definitive Technology speakers sounded practically muffled. The Klipsch bass was shallow and the Noble Fidelitys had a well-rounded bass. And this was in the boxes that Greg said weren’t showing off the bass well enough. It was an easy decision.</p>

<p>I was also impressed with the amount of time Greg gave me. Reading the reviews of the speakers, it’s clear that Greg likes talking to his customers. I can understand working with reviewers, but I’m just some schlub with no influence on his business. He talked to me about the history of the in-wall speaker business (80% of “in-wall” speakers are installed in ceilings), why in-wall speakers are rectangular (they look better on walls) and why in-ceiling speakers are round (they can’t be installed crooked and it’s harder to measure straight lines on a ceiling), gave me advice on where in the room to install in-ceiling speakers (not in the center of the room!). He even asked for drawings of the house and had his engineer suggest where to install the speakers in each room.</p>

<p>I took the speakers back home and, while waiting until it’s time to install them in the house, I’m using them as my office stereo speakers. They put my beloved Klipsch floor-standing speakers that I’ve had, and loved, for years to shame! And these are in-ceiling speakers that cost less!</p>

<p>The drywall is going in the house so we had to decide exactly where we would put the speakers in each room. I talked to Oliver, the engineer at Noble Fidelity, on Friday afternoon by phone to help me pick locations. He had to leave the office but promised to call me back that night at 7pm to finish. He did and we talked for an hour and a half about the speakers in each room and, along the way, I learned even more about acoustics. All told, I think I’ve consumed 3+ hours of Noble Fidelity’s time, much more than either Klipsch or Definitive Technology (zero). I love small companies that have a passion for their products.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>We went to the house today to go over the millwork with the millwork guy, adjust the foyer speakers (which someone already did), test the speakers in the house and decide on exact speaker locations in each room.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5415329946/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5059/5415329946_ec6d0a9812.jpg" alt="Basement with drywall" /></a></p>

<p>We got the see the basement drywalled and the taping guy was there doing his work. For the first time, we see real walls and can get a better sense of the space in each room. The drywallers were stocking all the drywall and materials for the other floors too with a boom that lifted everything through the windows in the upper floors.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>The exterior wall on the garage had been removed and they found that it isn’t plumb, so that needs to be fixed. They’ll put a door in it and a new surface on it and we’re going to have it stuccoed to match the house. This has held up the garage interior framing this week, but should resume next week. I’m hoping I can help out with that work, maybe lay the floor down since that’s easy.</p>

<p>Mark had picked up some more 2x6s for me so I built 3 more speaker boxes to mount the speakers. I then tested them in the living room to see which we prefer. We had picked our favorite of the 3 pairs at home, but the difference was negligible. But when we played them all at the house, the difference was striking – the one we preferred, Noble Fidelity, had a more clear sound that filled the room and the bass was much more pronounced. I assume the difference was more noticeable because the room is bigger, had no furniture in it and the walls and floor were wood rather than drywall and carpet. The receiver at the house was also 100 watts versus the 65 watt I used at home, which should also make a big difference.</p>

<p>We made some changes with Mark and Colin to the speaker placement in each room before the drywall goes up. I’ll go in next week once the drywall is up to cut holes in the ceilings. We also made yet more slight changes with Bill, the electrician, for some wiring.</p>

<p>We got out of the house by 4pm, picked up Thai take-out dinner, made a quick stop at The Beer Junction to stock up for the Super Bowl, missed the 5pm ferry, waited for the 5:40pm ferry and got home by 6pm. That’s 2  hours to go from Capitol Hill to Vashon, 80 minutes of that to go just the last 3 miles by boat! To compare, we could drive from Seattle to Portland or Vancouver, Canada in 3 hours.</p>

<p>It’s hard to tell them apart, though. Maybe some beer will help.</p>
