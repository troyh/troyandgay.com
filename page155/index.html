              <p>Palin said that Alaska’s proximity to Russia gives her foreign policy experience and she was laughed at because, well, it’s an idiotic statement. Now Katie Couric asked her about it and she seemed to dismiss it as just a flippant comment that she’s being made fun of over. Ok, that’d be smart, claim she was taken out of context and move on. But then goes on to defend it!:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbs.com/thunder/swf30can10cbsnews/rcpHolderCbs-3-4x3.swf">http://www.cbs.com/thunder/swf30can10cbsnews/rcpHolderCbs-3-4x3.swf</a></p>

<p>(She’s so eloquent and coherent, isn’t she?)</p>

<p>Is she implying that Russia invades Alaska often? Or is she implying that they are about to? Does she realize that Russia is our ally? At least she doesn’t seem to think she’s protecting us from Canada.</p>

<p>I wish Couric had asked her if the governors of Washington, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas are all foreign policy experts too since they actually <em>touch</em> other countries. Certainly in her teeny tiny brain they are.</p>

<p>Hell, I can see Puget Sound from my house. That makes me a marine biologist. I’ve seen lots and lots of numbers in my life, that makes me a mathematician… or an economist… or, why not, both! I’ve dropped things, that makes me a physicist. I used soap today, that makes me a chemist. I’m listening to music right now, I’m a musician.</p>

<p>When Sarah Palin’s parents told her she can be anything she wants to be, she took them literally. She is dumb. No wonder Republicans think women are inferior, this is what they consider their best and brightest.</p>

<p>The vet where Ouzo had his diagnosis and chemotherapy done sent us this card signed by several of the people who Ouzo met when he was there. I don’t know if this is common of vets to do, but it’s a nice gesture.</p>

              <p>Paul Krugman, as usual, wrote <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/22/opinion/22krugman.html?_r=2&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin">a clear article</a> in the NYT yesterday about Paulson’s plan to fix the economic crisis. Paulson used to be the CEO of Goldman Sachs, one of the “big five” investment banks, so it’s not hard to assume where his sympathies lie. And sure enough, he wants to reward the people who caused this mess.</p>

<p>The plan is for the government to spend $700 billion to buy bad loans (mortgages) from the companies who own the loans to prevent them from going under. But they can’t sell them at low prices, i.e., what they’re really worth, because that would cause the prices to fall even further due to the huge sell-off. So the government, actually tax-payers, is going to overpay for the loans so we can pretend that we bought something that is worth more than it really is. Where does this extra money go? To the shareholders and executives of the companies, of course. I wish I could run a business into the ground, pocketing salary and bonuses along the way, and then have the government buy my company at a profit.</p>

<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122209290438362805.html">Democrats want time to review the plan and make changes</a>, crazy ideas such as not allowing the thieves to benefit. Today George Bush awakened from his week-long sleep and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/23/business/23paulson.html?hp">urged Congress to stop thinking and start approving</a> the plan. If there’s one thing you can say about the Bush administration, it’s that they always take care of their own in a crisis.</p>

<p>On a side note, Al-Qaeda must be laughing at us. Between the dot-com bubble and crash, Enron, Worldcom, the sub-prime mortgage mess and now the financial industry tanking, we’re doing more damage to ourselves economically than they could hope to do.</p>

<p>He’s four weeks old now. So far, he’s been a great baby, much easier to take care of than Havana was. From what we understood, Havana was a very good baby so I was not expecting to be so lucky the second time. And with a 16 month-old and a newborn, we expected to have our hands full and to be hating it at this point.</p>

<p>But that’s not the case at all. Gay has to wake up every hour or two at night to feed him, of course, and some nights are better than others. Generally though, he’s very quiet and keeps to himself. I can even bottle-feed him already. I think that makes Gay happy. Havana let me do that maybe twice in total, but I’ve fed him twice in just the last few days. I can even get him to calm down and sleep my arms in minutes.</p>

<p>The next few weeks should be interesting to see if this streak of good fortune continues. The way it’s going, though, I’m hoping he’ll be sleeping through the night by the time he’s 4 months old.</p>
