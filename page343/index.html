          <p>I tried all last week to get the <a href="http://www.shands.org/">University of Florida in Gainesville</a> to get my dad in to see a neurologist. Although they promised every time to call his doctor immediately, they never did – doctors with their <a href="http://www.davidslife.com/journal/archives/000129.php">God Complex</a> are always too busy. So no appointment was ever made. Fortunately, his physician got him to see a local neurologist. Should be just as good.</p>

<p>My dad visited the neurologist today and he confirmed, apparently emphatically, that he does have hydrocephalus. I feel a lot more comfortable with that as do my parents. So next Thursday he goes in for his operation.</p>

          <p><a href="http://rss.com.com/2100-1027_3-5071138.html?part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=news">Universal Music</a> has announced that they are dropping the cost of CDs from $17-19 to $13 to “drive music fans back into retail stores”. The music industry is <em>finally</em> getting the message that Napster/Gnutella/Kazaa sent. Anyone who downloaded music on the internet should pat themselves on the back. And if you didn’t, be sure to give the sales clerk a $4-6 tip on each CD you buy.</p>

<p>I think CD prices should be under $10, actually, and this is just one company. But this is a promising start!</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/56/32635.html">The Register</a>: <em>US Attorney John McKay has described Parson as a “key figure” in the computer worm incident.</em></p>

<p>This is another case of the feds covering up the fact that they just can’t catch the original worm author (or any worm author, for that matter) so they’re going to pretend like they caught him. And people will believe it. Although this kid should be held responsible for his actions, he did very little in comparison (3%?) to the original Blaster worm.</p>

          <p>Using <a href="http://mywireservice.com">MyWireService</a> is an incredibly interesting thing… today’s Labor Day in the US, so there’s very little news in the US. The big news is that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/01/obituaries/01BRON.html?ex=1377835200&amp;en=c368734b32d384f2&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">Charles Bronson died</a>. But in Europe, the big headlines are all about <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Politics/kelly/story/0,13747,1033585,00.html?=rss">David Kelly</a> and that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/click/rss/0.91/public/-/1/hi/world/europe/3196609.stm">Libya has agreed to a settlement payout</a> for the 1989 <a href="http://www.cnn.com/LAW/trials.and.cases/case.files/0010/lockerbie/">Lockerbie bombing</a> (it’ll probably take them another 14 years to actually pay). It’s amazing how I can get up-to-speed on the news of the day in less than 10 minutes by visiting one web site.</p>
