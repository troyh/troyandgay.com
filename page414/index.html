          <p>Had good friends John and Deborah Bender over for dinner and drinks – I should probably say ‘drinks with a little dinner’.  Had <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/18487">Blue Cheese Beef Tenderloin</a> (but with a rib-eye roast instead), <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/49559">Leek Risotto</a>, a salad and <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/50264">Chocolate Fudge Brownies</a> with ice cream.  Boys enjoyed a narrow lead over the girls in 20th Century Trivial Pursuit before we had to call it quits.</p>

          <p>My birthday was today.  In celebration of being 33, I ran 3 laps (instead of my usual 2) for a total of 7 1/2 miles.  I really had a terrific day – aside from troubles with Recipezaar going down for a couple of hours due to an unsuccessful memory upgrade.  Troy went shopping with me and didn’t complain once.  We had a LOVELY dinner at <a href="http://tomdouglas.com/dahlia.html">Dahlia Lounge</a> with good friends Eric &amp; Steve and Biff &amp; Renuka.  We got to celebrate Eric’s new job and I outted Renuka’s pregnancy – there, now everyone on the internet knows.</p>

          <p>Recipezaar has an “everyone gets their birthdays off” policy.  Mine falls on a Saturday this year, so I took today off instead.  Celebrated with a trip to town, shopping, new hairdo, drinks with the girls, etc.  Couldn’t be better!</p>

          <p>Just as we’re preparing to increase the capacity of <a href="http://recipezaar.com">the site</a>, one server maxed out during the peak time-of-day today and was unavailable for an hour. Fortunately, I think I know exactly what happened: 3 events occurred simultaneously that just overloaded it. We’ll prevent that from happening in the future. Live &amp; learn!</p>

          <p><a href="http://dear_raed.blogspot.com/">Dear_Raed</a> is a fascinating weblog to read right now, written (supposedly) by a guy living in Baghdad during the bombing. It’s also interesting to read his perspective on the sanctions imposed on Iraq for the last decade.</p>
