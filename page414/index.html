            <p><a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/pacificnw/2003/0420/cover.html">Vashon Island</a>, described by activist Rita Schenck as “one-third artists, one-third environmentalists and one-third lawyers.”  I guess that makes us lawyers.  Cover story of this week’s Pacific Northwest Magazine talks about Vashon’s efforts to be self-sustaining.  There’s evena guy here who makes his own bio-diesel fuel by recycling oil from deep-fryers – “his exhaust smells like french fries” and his operations recently burnt down.</p>

            <p>We saw <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/movies/reviews/movie/1106668">Y Tu Mama Tambien</a>. It was very good, in spite of the subtitles. But don’t watch it unless you’re willing to see lots of naked people doing things with other naked people.</p>

            <p>We saw <a href="http://www.mgm.com/ua/personalvelocity/">Personal Velocity</a> last night. Blah. <a href="http://www.parkerposey.org/">Parker Posey</a> was good, as usual, but overall not worth watching, in my opinion. I’m surprised it won the Grand Jury Prize at the <a href="http://festival.sundance.org/index.aspx">Sundance Film Festival</a>. There were 2 <a href="http://apple.com/ibook/">iBooks</a> in it, though.</p>

            <p>We did yard work today. It’s nice to take a break from computers and do work that is more physical. I got to use <a href="http://www.husqvarna.com.au/node266.asp">my chainsaw</a> again and cut off some big branches off some maple trees in the yard. On Christmas Day last year a huge tree fell down in our yard so I had to learn about chainsaws, buy one and go cut it up. That was a lot of work, but now I look forward to chainsawing. Is there anything chainsaws can’t do?! :)</p>

            <p>Already this year, we’ve added 3 servers to keep up with the volume of traffic on <a href="http://recipezaar.com">the site</a> and expect to add at least 3 more by the end of the year. The other day all the pieces arrived to build the next new server for the site. I get a lot of satisfaction building a machine from scratch, but it’s always been a painful experience with the seemingly endless hardware troubles. This was the smoothest one yet, except I spent 3 hours last night fiddling with the machine trying to get it to power up. I gave up at 1am and went to bed.</p>

<p>I woke up, spent some time reading message boards and newsgroups to help diagnose the problem (how would I have done this before the internet? Call Taiwan for tech support?!). Not optimistic, I went for a bike ride while the morning weather was great rather than spend more frustrating hours tinkering to find out it’s raining. When I got back, I tried a few things that didn’t work and then figured, as a last shot, a different video card. <em>It worked!</em> The problem was that the (very reliable, until now) video card wasn’t working which made it appear the machine was not powering up. It was, I just couldn’t see anything on the monitor. That’s great, but I can’t believe I wasted 3 hours on a stupid video card.</p>

<p>Now it’s all just software to finish this machine, which is the easy part (for me). This machine should take us quite a ways down the road til the next upgrade.</p>
