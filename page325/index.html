            <p>I lost a lot of respect for <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/60minutes/main3415.shtml">60 Minutes</a> last night when I watched their advertisement for the movie industry. I’m glad <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001472.shtml#001472">Dan Gillmor also found it to be pandering</a>. I’m sick of the RIAA claiming the music industry is dead and we’re only going to hear more about how the movie industry is dying because of internet piracy. Bear in mind that the top actors/actresses in Hollywood are paid $20-30 million for a month’s work and Hollywood execs are paid 7- or 8-figure salaries. No, they are pretending that the blue collar workers (those who make the sets for movies) are the ones being hurt. Yeah, I’m sure Jack Valenti is concerned about them. In my opinion, just like with music, if you’re making movies for the money, I don’t want your product. Make something with integrity, and that’s very inexpensive to do. Accept that some amount of piracy will always exist and you’ll still make a profit. Wal-Mart survives in spite of lots of shoplifting. Hollywood can too.</p>

<p>The 60 Minutes piece ended with a suggestion that we all go to <a href="http://movielink.com">MovieLink</a> where we can purchase movies online. Great, they’ve learned something from the RIAA’s mistakes. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work for Mac users.</p>

            <p>I love waking up in the morning to read <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=50750">this</a>:</p>

<p>_I just wanted to thank everyone at this site for helping me drop my husband’s cholestrol level by 27 points in just 5 weeks. He just had surgery for blocked arteries in his neck and is on a strict no cholestrol diet. A friend pointed me to this site and since then my husband has enjoyed many new recipes and doesn’t mind at all that they are low fat. Even found him some low fat brownies…his favorite. <em>L</em> well, thanks again folks….keep up the good work. _</p>

            <p>Moron morning radio talk show hosts <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20031101/ap_on_en_ot/radio_stations_bicyclists_1">advocate violence against bicyclists</a>. I used to live in the Washington DC area and this is unsurprising. I’ve had bottles thrown at me, cars swerve or honk to scare me, passengers throw punches and spit at me, people even yelling “faggot” at me (I haven’t had a problem at all on the west coast). Why? THere was a pschology study released years ago that explained that drivers who deal with traffic become angry when they see people “having fun” (cyclists and joggers appear to be having fun) and tend to react aggressively towards them. I’ve even heard my own dad mutter “stupid bicycles!” while driving and even had a friend in our car, who knew I was a cyclist, who actually suggested we hit the cyclist on the road ahead of us because “roads are for cars” (which is untrue, <a href="http://newstribune.com/stories/102700/opi_1027000027.asp">roads were originally built for bicycles</a>). Humans.</p>

<p>If you ever want to realize how completely idiotic drivers are, get on a bicycle and ride on the road with them. You really see things you don’t when in a car. They speed up to get to red lights, dangerously swerve into oncoming traffic to pass a cyclist so they can gain precious microseconds in getting to their destination, many even talk on cell phones or read newspapers while steering their 1-2 ton death machines at 60MPH.</p>

            <p>Gay asked and we received <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=50449&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0">menu ideas</a> from Recipezaar people. It took a while to decide, so many things looked good. At first, a couple bread puddings were a definite, but as we worked out the other items on the menu, they had to go. Disappointing, but there’s always other times for bread pudding. Many other dishes were in the plan, but some had to go due to time constraints (we really should have started the planning yesterday) and to get the right combination of things.</p>

<p>Here’s the final plan…</p>

<p>We’ll start with a <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/8877">Manhattans</a>, of course, and <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/41126">Chipotle-Barbecued Shrimp with Goat Cheese Cream</a> by <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=32724">Mean Chef</a>.</p>

<p>Gay picked up some lamb and a rib roast and I chose the rib roast mainly because I wanted some fresh horseradish sauce tonight. So we’ll have that with <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/44995">Sauteed Mushrooms with Red Wine</a> by <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=55655">Just Call Me Martha</a>, <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/addrecipe/temp/index.zsp?bb=t50449p623992">Yorkshire Pudding</a> by <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=32724">Mean Chef</a> and <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/29309">Warm Pumpkin Spinach and Feta Salad</a> by <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=29196">Jan S</a> for the side.</p>

<p>And for wine, we have a choice of a 2000 <a href="http://www.quilcedacreek.com/VintageNotes.asp#Red">Quilceda Creek red table wine</a>, a <a href="http://www.stagsleapwinery.com/wines/00cab.html">2000 Stag’s Leap Cabernet Sauvignon</a> or a <a href="http://woodwardcanyon.com/TechSheets/98wwcab.htm">1998 Woodward Canyon Cabernet Sauvignon</a>. Not sure how much my 34th birthday is worth.</p>

<p>I always have a German Chocolate Cake for my birthday cake and have ever since I can remember. Last year, I had an incredible one that will be hard to beat but <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/18575">German Chocolate Squares</a> by <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=8688">Bev</a> looks promising.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who suggested recipes! I wish we could have made more things, but I can’t make Gay work that hard or she may ask me to cook for her on her birthday.</p>
