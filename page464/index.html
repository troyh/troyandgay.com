            <p>Ed (of Ed &amp; Tammy, our pig-farm neighbors) dropped by this morning. He was worried that the Asplundh markers on the trees to be trimmed/removed were survey markers and wanted to know if we were upset that he parks his rusty Ford Granada on our property and he said he’d get rid of the dead cars in his “driveway”. He also tells us (Gay) that they are going to sell the house and move because of problems with the Knox’s over the years. But then again, he told us a year ago that he was going to clean up his yard.</p>

            <p>We’ve decided to postpone the new site design until next week so that we don’t kill ourselves to get it out by this weekend, especially since I (we) won’t be working tomorrow at all in celebration of my birthday. The new design is so significant that it’s best to sit on it internally for a little while. Plus, there are some serious bugs (with reviews and review notifications) on the existing site that need to be fixed.</p>

            <p>Mom &amp; Dad sent me two books for my birthday: <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0140257314/qid=1036098721/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-4669202-2528966?v=glance&amp;n=507846">Startup</a></em> by Jerry Kaplan and by <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743200403/qid=1036098765/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-4669202-2528966?v=glance&amp;n=507846">One Up on Wall Street</a></em> by Peter Lynch. Both from my Amazon Wish List. I’ve already read 3 chapters in <em>Startup</em> and I really like it.</p>
