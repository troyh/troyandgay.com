          <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/bergypkg.JPG" alt="bergypkg.JPG" /> The other day, a package arrived in the mail for our dogs, Illy &amp; Ouzo, from a famous <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> member, <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=4470">Bergy</a>. Actually, the package was from her <strike>doggies</strike> cats.</p>

<p>Inside was a cute card written by Bergy’s <strike>dogs</strike> cats (actually, I suspect Bergy wrote it) and gourmet dog cookies and Illy &amp; Ouzo both loved them! Normally when given treats they eat them right there and then look at you waiting for another. Only the good treats make them grab them and run away. And that’s what they did with these. Illy ran outside and Ouzo ran the other direction to living room so they could eat them in peace.</p>

<p>Thanks Bergy! And the dogs thank you too! :-)</p>

<p>We’ve received several gifts from members of Recipezaar and we’re terrible at returning the favor. We need to be better site owners.</p>

          <p>Gay just left for Spokane for her godfather’s funeral tomorrow. It’s just me and the dogs fending for ourselves tonight. I think Gay and I have spent a total of 6 nights apart in 5 years. This will make #7.</p>

          <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/manhattan-glass.jpg" alt="manhattan-glass.jpg" />Always looking for new ways to enjoy a <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/8877">Manhattan</a>, we found these glasses at Crate &amp; Barrel on Saturday. Gay thinks they’re stupid, but they keep the drink chilled with the ice water in the bottom part of the glass. They’re a little hard to drink out of and a little hard to handle, but I think they look cool.</p>

          <p>Working on MyWireService, I’ve been surprised at the number of library &amp; school news sources are out there in RSS – I really expected only tech sources and weblogs.  <a href="http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/2003/08/15.html#a44322">The Shifted Librarian encourages other libraries to put their information in RSS</a>, and I got to thinking: use a weblog and RSS is easier to support than an e-mail newsletter.  No membership database, no customers with forgotten passwords, not separate tool where some stuff is in the email newsletter but not available on the site, etc.  Unfortunately, RSS Aggregators are not as ubiquitous as email…yet.  We hope that <a href="http://mywireservice.com">our Web-based RSS Aggregator</a> will become more common just like web-based email is more convenient…</p>
