        <article>
          <p>The second annual <a href="http://seattlebeerweek.com">Seattle Beer Week</a> came and I only made it to one event, like “last year”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/05/13/date-night-2/. Tonight, we took the kids into West Seattle to <a href="http://www.circawestseattle.com/">Circa</a>. Circa was having a <a href="http://stonebrew.com">Stone</a> event so they had 4 Stone beers on tap: Levitation Ale, Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale, Ruination IPA and Imperial Russian Stout. We’d never even heard of the first two and have never had any of them on tap. I love their Imperial Russian Stout and make it a point to get it when they make it two times a year, so I was happy to see that and knew I would have it for my dessert beer.</p>

<p>While we waited for a table, I went to the bar to get the Ruination IPA. I was almost done with it by the time we got our table. Gay ordered the Sublimely Self-Righteous and when I was done, I ordered Russian River’s Pliny The Elder, which was also on tap. We quickly ordered food for the kids since it was getting late and they were very hungry. While they ate, we ordered our food. I got the venison braised in Stone’s Imperial Russian Stout (yum!) and Gay ordered the beef. For dessert, I had the creme brulee, which was huge and very good with the sweet stout. Gay and the kids got chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream. A representative from Stone gave us a few stickers and we were heading to the 8:10pm ferry. The kids were very well-behaved and quiet, which is always a risk when taking them out these days, especially so close to their bedtime. It was a fun time and I’m glad I got to attend at least one event this year. Next year, I hope to do more.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/23/magazine/23strikes-t.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">published an article</a> about a friend of ours (the husband of a friend of Gay’s), Mike Romano, about his work to get egregious life-terms under California’s strict 3-strikes policy overturned. I’m all for locking career criminals up for life, but not for petty crimes. Accused murderers get more free legal resources, and a better chance of acquittal or successful appeal, than those accused of their 3rd strike:</p>

<blockquote>In practical terms, Romano points out, the difference between being  convicted of capital murder and a small-time third strike is this: a  murderer is entitled to a far greater share of legal resources.  California spends at least $300,000 on the defense side of a capital  murder trial. The courts give extra scrutiny to each capital appeal that  comes before them. And it's only in death-penalty cases that the state  pays lawyers to file a writ of habeas corpus, the route to challenging a  conviction once direct appeal has been exhausted.</blockquote>

<p>The article talks of a guy who was convicted of three thefts over 15 years amounting to a few hundred dollars in property. He was thrown in jail for the rest of his life.</p>

<blockquote>In court, Romano and his students don't simply argue that their clients  are minor offenders who don't deserve to spend the rest of their lives  in prison. ... Romano argues that, as in capital cases, his clients deserve to ask for  lesser sentences based on "mitigating evidence" -- often of child abuse,  mental illness or mental retardation.</blockquote>

<p>Mike’s a lawyer who is using his powers for good instead of evil. (That’s a joke, I have a ton of respect for good lawyers).</p>

          <p>We planned to go to the <a href="http://www.alwaysfreshgoodness.com/">Volunteer Park Cafe</a> last night and made a reservation the day before. We ended up not being able to make it so I called to cancel my reservation. I always do this and even call when we’re running late for a reservation because it’s the right thing to do. I imagine most people don’t call and just don’t show up so the restaurant is left holding a table too long. I assume that’s why I’ve <em>always</em> been thanked for it. I was surprised, however, when the person I talked to wasn’t appreciative and sarcastically said “Thanks for canceling at the super last-minute” (“super last-minute” being three hours before the 7pm reservation). I thought it was such bad form that I posted my <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/volunteer-park-cafe-and-marketplace-seattle#hrid:0xBAegCMomVD2h40esl2BA">first-ever review on Yelp</a> about it.</p>

<p>This afternoon, having seen the review, the manager called me to apologize and explain that it was him I talked to and that  he was having a stressful day. He was very contrite. Little things like that go a long way and I have a lot more respect for someone who can admit that they were wrong and apologize for it.</p>

          <p>I started typing a Google search on my iPad and got the suggestions from Google, which, of course, are based on the most common searches other people have done. Some are some very good questions (that have no good answer), but I especially like the last one for many reasons.  Again, this is the 5th most-common question people ask Google that begins with “why are”.</p>

          <p>Tonight was Reid &amp; Marissa’s wedding at <a href="http://www.therainierclub.com/">The Rainier Club</a>. We’d never been to the Rainier Club before, but it’s an old Seattle landmark and beautiful building right in downtown.</p>

<p>The ceremony was the shortest I’ve ever been to. It may have lasted all of 5 minutes. They presiding judge gave the “We are gathered here today…” spiel and they went straight into the vows and that was it and we were off to the ballroom downstairs for the reception. That’s how quick all weddings should be! A friend who was married in Las Vegas said his ceremony was longer.</p>

<p>It was a perfect Seattle night and the Rainier Club is such a classic Seattle building it felt great to be there, especially out on the balcony surrounded by the lights of downtown. During cocktail hour (a good Manhattan crowd, reminded me of our wedding), food was served by several waiters walking around. Everything was delicious, especially the Roquefort-stuffed mushrooms. Dinner and cake was also very good.</p>

<p>We saw lots of friends we hadn’t seen in a long time, so we ended up staying longer than planned and took the 11:40pm ferry home. Poor Kelly, two late baby-sitting nights in a row.</p>
