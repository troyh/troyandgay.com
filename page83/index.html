          <p>Today was the sewer inspection. We weren’t there, but the real estate agent was and all went well. The inspection company sends a DVD (with popcorn) of a movie of the camera’s trip through the pipes. I’m not sure I want to watch it.</p>

<p>The only inspection left to do is a hazardous materials inspection. The house has a fair amount of 60s/70s era tile flooring which, together with the glue that was commonly-used, was later found to contain asbestos, which was later found to be harmful to humans, especially kids. Removing it is expensive because it has to be handled carefully and disposed of properly.</p>

          <p>We took the 9am ferry, stopped at <a href="http://www.toppotdoughnuts.com/">Top Pot</a> for doughnuts to feed everyone and got to the house right on time at 10am. Doug and two others from Schuchart/Dow were already there. Their sub-contractors for plumbing, electrical, floors, painting, stucco, heating/AC, windows, drywall all showed up and Doug took them through the house so they could write up estimates for necessary repairs and for the extra work we want to do.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>We really like Schuchart/Dow. They’re organized, they understand what we want, they don’t sugar-coat anything and they seem to get the best sub-contractors in Seattle. I’ve met lots of plumbers, electricians, painters, HVAC guys, etc. over the years and I haven’t dealt with many that aren’t gruff and impersonal. Everyone we’ve met has been very friendly and answer  our dumb questions without talking down to us.</p>

<p>We have a couple more inspections to get done: sewer and pest and possibly a mold inspection. We were very nervous a couple weeks ago about going against the advice  of our real estate agent and Jim Dow, so this information is helping us  to better understand the risks. Hopefully by the end of the week, we’ll have cost estimates for the repair work and for the additional work. Based on that, we can decide if we really want to buy it.</p>

          <p>We met the home inspectors at the house at noon. Jim Dow and Doug, from <a href="http://www.schuchartdow.com/">Shuchart/Dow</a>, and <a href="http://www.nbdesigngroup.net/">Nancy Burfiend</a>, the interior decorator who helped us with our current house, and a couple of her colleagues came over too. By 6pm we were all done. Two hours is my normal meeting limit so I was tired of talking.</p>

<p>Gay and I stopped at <a href="http://www.smithseattle.com/">Smith</a>, a restaurant in our new neighborhood, for dinner and to relax before driving back to Vashon. Kelly had taken the kids to the museum and zoo in Tacoma, so they also had a long day but we got to see them before they went to bed.</p>

<p>We had a lot of information to process, so neither of us could sleep. We tried, but we didn’t get to sleep until after 2am.</p>

<p>The inspection went better than we thought. We were expecting major problems, like the entire exterior surface of the house had to be taken off and replaced, but that doesn’t appear to be the case. That’s good. The written report should tell us more. And next week we’ll have the contractor’s sub-contractors take a look.</p>

        <article>
          <p>18 months ago we decided to stay put on Vashon and build a new house to replace our house that is one bedroom too small and that we generally don’t like. We hired an architect, fired that architect and then hired a much better architect. We got throughout schematic design and had a great design. But we were increasingly weary of committing to raising the kids on Vashon for the next 20 years. The crazy Vashon people and their fear of progress, the lousy elementary and middle schools, the low percentage (50%) of high school kids going to college and the lack of diversity make for a place where I’d regret raising the kids. I went to high school where education and learning were not respected and very few of my friends went to college. I could do better than that for my kids.</p>

<p>We started house-hunting in the San Francisco area. We figured if there was a good time to buy in San Francisco, the Great American Housing Crisis was it. We took 3 trips down there but couldn’t find anything we liked or could afford in or out of the city. Then we started house-hunting in Seattle, which seemed cheap in comparison to San Francisco.

We narrowed in on Capitol Hill and Washington Park neighborhoods quickly just based on access to good public schools, walkability to restaurants and parks and larger yards. We made an offer on a house in Capitol Hill but couldn’t agree on price and we lost a poorly-handled bidding-war on a second house in Washington Park.</p>

<p>We weren’t using a real estate agent thinking we could do it ourselves (with the internet) and thinking we could pay less for the house by saving the seller the 3% broker commission. In both cases, we think it hurt us not having an agent – other agents just don’t feel comfortable talking directly with buyers. Or maybe they fear their obsolescence and resist?</p>

<p>We decided to enlist a real estate agent and picked one of Seattle’s best, Bob Bennion. Bob proves that there is such a thing as a valuable agent. He has decades of experience and is well-connected. We found a house in Capitol Hill that needed lots of work but has tons of potential. Bob advised us not to buy it. We brought our contractor along to check it out and he too told us not to buy it (and he’d get paid to renovate it!). We made an offer anyway and after 3 weeks, we agreed on a price.</p>

<p>Now for the inspection…</p>

        <article>
          <p>The second annual <a href="http://seattlebeerweek.com">Seattle Beer Week</a> came and I only made it to one event, like “last year”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/05/13/date-night-2/. Tonight, we took the kids into West Seattle to <a href="http://www.circawestseattle.com/">Circa</a>. Circa was having a <a href="http://stonebrew.com">Stone</a> event so they had 4 Stone beers on tap: Levitation Ale, Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale, Ruination IPA and Imperial Russian Stout. We’d never even heard of the first two and have never had any of them on tap. I love their Imperial Russian Stout and make it a point to get it when they make it two times a year, so I was happy to see that and knew I would have it for my dessert beer.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>While we waited for a table, I went to the bar to get the Ruination IPA. I was almost done with it by the time we got our table. Gay ordered the Sublimely Self-Righteous and when I was done, I ordered Russian River’s Pliny The Elder, which was also on tap. We quickly ordered food for the kids since it was getting late and they were very hungry. While they ate, we ordered our food. I got the venison braised in Stone’s Imperial Russian Stout (yum!) and Gay ordered the beef. For dessert, I had the creme brulee, which was huge and very good with the sweet stout. Gay and the kids got chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream. A representative from Stone gave us a few stickers and we were heading to the 8:10pm ferry. The kids were very well-behaved and quiet, which is always a risk when taking them out these days, especially so close to their bedtime. It was a fun time and I’m glad I got to attend at least one event this year. Next year, I hope to do more.</p>
