          <p>Tonight was the Rehearsal Dinner for Reid &amp; Marissa’s wedding at <a href="http://www.harborclubs.org/seattle_clubinfo.cfm">The Harbor Club</a> in downtown Seattle, which has a great view of Elliot Bay all the way to Mt. Rainier. The usual people were there and we met a few other friends and people from Marissa’s family.</p>

<p>A surprise was to see Eric Wagner there, who was supposed to be on their boat in Panama. We last <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/12/09/eric-valerie-in-cabo/">saw them in December</a> in Mexico.</p>

        <article>
          <p>The National’s <em>High Violet</em> was finally released yesterday and I bought it immediately, even though I’ve been listening to it practically non-stop streaming from the New York Times and, when that ended, from NPR. I haven’t listened to an album this repeatedly since Radiohead’s 1997 <em>OK Computer</em>, <a href="http://www.time.com/time/2006/100albums/0,27693,OK_Computer,00.html">one of the greatest albums ever made</a> – to this day, I still listen to a song or two from that album almost every day (they’re surprisingly good songs to run to).
<!-- more --></p>

<p>The <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/clicktrack/2010/05/album_review_the_national_high.html">Washington Post</a> has less love for it:</p>

<blockquote>It's methodical and smart, filled with inscrutable but deep-sounding  ruminations on love and loss. Its twisty, intricate rhythms and lush  orchestral passages would take lesser bands years to figure out. It's  carefully made and entirely admirable -- and very, very dull, like an  Arcade Fire album where nothing happens.

Like most National discs, its charms gradually reveal themselves over  repeated listenings, although it might just be the Stockholm syndrome  kicking in. How much you like the National depends on how much you're  determined to like the National, a band that seems to delight in making  it difficult.</blockquote>

<p>But everyone else seems to like music that can’t be judged after one listen…</p>

<p><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14203-high-violet/">Pitchfork</a>:</p>

<blockquote>They could've holed up and recorded an idiosyncratic,  expectation-defying mess. Instead they produced an ornate, fussed-over  record that sounds like no one other than themselves.  Given the amount  of flack they take for being a no-frills bore, simply refining their  sound was arguably the braver option. They miss, occasionally-- the  string-drenched closer, "Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks", is too decadent for  its own good-- but mostly, they construct gorgeous, structurally sound  vignettes. There are few bands that could craft a song like "Sorrow"--  in which emotion acts as a character and the band turns Berninger's  balladry into a well paced jog-- without stumbling over their own  ambitions.  The guitars on "Afraid of Everyone" actually sound nervous;  "England" speaks of cathedrals over properly magisterial drums. These  are triumphs of form.</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/05/album-review-the-nationals-high-violet.html">LA Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote>...The National is ruffled and tufted, sometimes embracing pomp and  circumstance, sometimes turning its back on it cold. ... One of the most stunning pieces on "High Violet" is "England," which opens with steadily mounting orchestration --  rippling piano chords, the low thunder of drums, some pining strings and  lofty horns. At its blustery peak, it threatens to topple from its own  melodrama. The pleasure is in listening to how often the National  scrapes up close to maudlin, only to retreat in the nick of time.</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/cd_reviews/article7117334.ece">Times Online</a>:</p>

<blockquote>High Violet takes the  journey to its next stage. You listen to tracks such as Sorrow,  Lemonworld,  Conversation 16, to the way Afraid of Everyone's ghostly backing vocals,  its  guitar squiggle -- which counterpoints Berninger's existential,  state-of-America cry of pain -- and Bryan Devendorf's urgent drumming  lift  the song into a different realm, and think: this is what music must do,  this  is what music means. Anything else is froth. A masterpiece.</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.nme.com/reviews/the-national--2/11286">NME</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Goddamn it's taken a while, but with **'High Violet'** **The  National**'s slow and steady evolution can no longer be ignored.  This lot are fully grown-up, coloured in and going overground. And if  the masses aren't ready by now, they probably never will be.</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review_36372">Sputnik Music</a>:</p>

<blockquote>There  isn't a bad song on the album, and generally when people say things  like that they seem to imply that there are still a few duds here and  there.  But High Violet is literally free of weak moments... The National should give faith to anyone who has become disillusioned  with indie music, anyone who misses a time where it didn't seem like all  the musicians thought they were better than you and you could actually  relate to the damn words they were singing.  High Violet is another  batch of cement to further supplement The National's already unshakable  concrete career.</blockquote>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>I got an email this morning from a friend who is notorious for sending this stuff without checking <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/immigration/petition.asp">Snopes</a> first. But you don’t even need Snopes for things like this, as I’m going to show…</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>It begins like this…</p>

<blockquote>SOCIAL SECURITY CHANGES
It does not matter if you personally like or dislike Obama.</blockquote>

<p>Gee, I wonder this the rest of this is going to go. Just that tells you this is intended for people who dislike Obama. It’s an out for the Obama-haters to say “Good, I do hate Obama but I won’t look like I’m just another Obama-hater when I believe what I’m about to read, and I am going to believe it because Obama must be doing something I don’t like”. According to Snopes, it originated in 2006 with “Bush” substituted for “Obama”, which was just as effective with a different group of imbeciles.</p>

<blockquote>You need to sign this petition and flood his e-mail box with e-mails that tell him that, even if the House passes this bill, he needs to veto it.
</blockquote>

<p>That’s for the dummies who think that the President of the US 1) has “an e-mail box”,  2) reads every message in it, 3) that he’d set Federal policy based on emails from a bunch of lunatic dimwits who refuse to participate in the democracy and can only muster the energy to forward an email around. But to be fair, I’d bet that 90% of the people who sign this petition make decisions in their lives based on very little or no information, so they assume the President does too.</p>

<blockquote>It is already impossible to live on Social Security alone.  If the government gives benefits to 'illegal' aliens who have never contributed, where does that leave those of us who have paid into Social Security all our working lives?</blockquote>

<p>Good point! This makes sense to people who don’t even know that Social Security benefits are given to people with Social Security numbers, the very things that illegal immigrants lack. But that aside, this is the kind of argument  that nitwits take at face value. These are just statements, but dressed-up as facts. And by “dressed-up” I mean that they’re written in simple words. You can argue anything this way: “The earth is flat, if it were round we’d all roll off of it”, “It was really cold this winter where I live so global warming is a lie”, “The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was perpetrated by environmentalists to make oil companies look bad”.</p>

<blockquote>As stated below, the Senate voted this week to allow 'illegal' aliens access to Social Security benefits.
</blockquote>

<p>Where’s the news article about this? Dummies don’t need proof of things they want to believe, they just believe them because the very thought makes them angry. If it makes you angry, it must be true, right? And only the dumbest of the dumb don’t read the remaining 4 sentences to realize it never is stated below. They’ve already been sold on the idea that it’s true, their brain is mad now, let’s keep going…</p>

<blockquote>Attached is an opportunity to sign a petition that requires citizenship for eligibility to that social service.
Instructions are below.  If you don't forward the petition and just stop it, we will lose all these names.
</blockquote>

<p>This is the call to arms. How the entire country has missed this huge news story must be explained as a liberal media trick. But Fox News hasn’t even covered it? Come on, half their news isn’t even true and they won’t even touch this? It must be so obviously false they don’t even try. Even they overestimate the intelligence of their audience.</p>

<blockquote>
If you do not want to sign it, please just forward it to everyone you know.
Thank you!
To add your name, click on 'forward'.  Address it to all of your email correspondents, add your name to the list and send it on.
When the petition hits 1,000, send it to comment@whitehouse.gov &lt; http://us.mc1146.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=comment@whitehouse.gov &gt;;
</blockquote>

<p>There’s two clues here that should be obvious. The first is that it follows the old internet rule that any email is a lie that tells you to forward it to everyone you know. It’s a joke people play to see how far they can get their email to circulate the globe. There never has been and never will be an email that asks you to do that that is true. Don’t forget that.</p>

<p>The second clue is one internet newbies could be excused for missing, especially if their email client didn’t expose the URL for the email address. “comment@whitehouse.gov” looks believable (gee, it has .gov rather than the usual .com, it must be legit), but the URL has a mail.yahoo.com address in it, which should tell you that it goes to Yahoo mail, not the President’s “e-mail box”.</p>

<p>The petition starts…</p>

<blockquote>PETITION for President Obama:
Dear Mr. President:
We, the undersigned, protest the bill that the Senate voted on recently which would allow illegal aliens to access our Social Security.  We demand that you and all Congressional representatives require citizenship as a pre-requisite for social services in the United States .</blockquote>

<p>And ends with a list of over 1000 gullible people.</p>

<p>It even got morphed from “Social Security benefits” to “social services”. People who sign this petition are saying they want proof of citizenship before <em>any</em> social service is provided. Imagine a child in an emergency room being asked for proof of citizenship before they save their life. Imagine a policeman asking a woman who was just beaten and raped for her ID card before he wastes precious tax dollars chasing the rapist. Imagine firemen watching your house burn while you run inside looking for  your passport.</p>

<p>The people who signed this petition aren’t just stupid, they aren’t just people who slept through civics classes in high school and have no understanding of how our government works – they’re assholes. Those are the people who are keeping America down, not immigrants. America was built by immigrants and immigrants, i.e., people who <em>want</em> to come here for opportunity and to work hard, are what make America strong. This “I’m in, now close the door” attitude is un-American and for lazy people. I’d like to see a petition to revoke the US citizenship of everyone who signed this petition.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Gay had her 3rd Mother’s Day today. We were all tired because I went to a Bachelor Party last night and Gay got the kids up at 1am to come pick me up (as planned, not because I was stranded somewhere embarrassing in a drunken stupor). So we didn’t get to bed until 2am and got up at 6am with Havana.
<!-- more --></p>

<p>I got her a few books and the kids chipped in and got her a new camera to replace the one she got two years ago for Mother’s Day, which broke a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>The weather was great. I got the hammock stand out of the garage, put it together with help from Havana and Hudson, and got some use out of it for the first time this year. Gay took Havana to her afternoon dance recital and Hudson and I hung out in the hammock for a while. Later, Reid and Mark stopped by on their way home from the Bachelor Party to return my jacket I left there and we had a couple beers in the backyard. It was a relaxing day.</p>

          <p>Havana had her first dance recital tonight. She’d been going to rehearsal for a few weeks, something parents weren’t allowed in to see. After about 45 minutes, Havana made her debut.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4595264313/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3626/4595264313_fdfec1c83d.jpg" alt="IMG_2261" /></a></p>

<p>We had to leave at intermission so Gay could drop me off at Reid’s bachelor party at his dad’s cabin on the island. There I saw some Jon, Mark, Peter and Reid’s brother who I hadn’t seen in a long time as well as Mark and Reid, of course. I was late but they saved me the biggest steak I’ve ever seen, that was perfectly-cooked.</p>
