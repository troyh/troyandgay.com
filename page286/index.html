          <p>An interesting <a href="http://news.com.com/2010-7352_3-5185413.html?part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=news">article</a> about the importance of IP (Internet Protocol, not Intellectual Property). The world will indeed be great as long as competition exists. Unfortunately, over the last few years, the US Govt has consistently sided with big corps over small corps and the FCC seems to be willing to let any two large corps merge into a mammoth corp. If the government doesn’t figure this out and quick, we’ll be paying exorbitant rates  to monolithic corporations and it’ll take several decades to correct itself. Support your local antitrust lawyer!</p>

          <p>A couple weeks ago, we got a call from a friend asking us to volunteer to help out for a big festival/auction at the end of summer that he was organizing. Wanting to do something for the community and to help out our friend who was very busy, we agree. A few days later, he quits! Apparently, he was not happy with the direction it was going. <em>He was the leader!</em> If something’s going in the wrong direction, who but the leader is to blame? Yet he blamed everyone else. And how’d he quit? Warn anyone? Nope. He sends a resignation letter out of the blue. Then just days after that, he sends another one. Seriously. Two resignation letters for the same job. “I quit!” and “I doubly quit!”.</p>

<p>So here we are, two people who spend easily 80+ hours a week each (not counting the time we spend midnight to 7am dreaming about work) working on our own business and we volunteer to add another responsibility to our lives to help out a friend in need. We’re also in the process of planning our wedding that we’re having just 2 weeks before this event.</p>

<p>Now, we (and the others involved) have even more work to do because he left the project in shambles and we have to pick up the pieces. Are you ever surprised when your elders behave like children? Age and maturity have nothing to do with each other. And selfish people suck.</p>

          <p>Kurt Cobain committed suicide 10 years ago today. I remember talking about it at lunch with an older coworker and he said “Who was he and why does anyone care?”. I also still remember the day I bought <em>Nevermind</em> a few years earlier. And I remember my mom looking at my Nevermind t-shirt (that I still have) and saying “<a href="http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/B000003TA4.08.LZZZZZZZ.jpg">What a dumb picture</a>”.</p>

<p>Listening to NPR, which is doing a show on Kurt Cobain, people call in telling how Kurt Cobain affected their lives. While a lot of people criticize him for suicide, there’s a lot of people whose lives he saved through his music. As a former teenager myself, I can still understand what it’s like to be angry and depressed about life and the world and how music can be the outlet for it. I hope I don’t lose that understanding as I get older and have teenage kids of my own.</p>

          <p>Finally! Netflix <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2004/04/05/news/midcaps/netflix_downloads/index.htm">is planning</a> to launch a movie download service next year. I’ve said it before twice (<a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/03/001268.php">1</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/09/001724.php">2</a>) that TiVo and Netflix should partner to do this. No mention of TiVo, but Netflix has to have something installed at your home do the downloading (and my desktop computer isn’t going to cut it) and TiVo fits the bill, IMO.</p>

          <p>Several months ago I was given a free subscription to <a href="http://www.macworld.com/">MacWorld</a> magazine and was offered the regular print version or their new electronic version. Of course, I chose electronic. You read it with software from <a href="http://zinio.com/">Zinio</a> which is impressive. It looks exactly like the print version (with ads too). You can zoom-in/out, click links, highlight and make annotations with relative ease. No copying &amp; pasting though. The total experience is pretty close to reading a printed copy, complete with a visual effect of pages turning. I still can’t sit on the couch and flip through the magazine, but other than that, this is the future of publishing.</p>
