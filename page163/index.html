          <p>Wow, I wish “BeerMenus.com”:http://beermenus.com would add Seattle bars and pubs to its database. It’s Manhattan and Brooklyn only now.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Hmmm…. by my calculations, Gay scores 5 merits and 7 demerits for a total of -2 on the “Wife’s Marital Rating Scale”:http://www.apa.org/monitor/2008/05/marriage.html used by a respected marriage counselor in 1939.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Not only does she fail to sew on buttons or darn socks <em>regularly</em>, I have no evidence she has ever darned a single sock. Demerit! I’m sure that if she actually wore hose, the seams would be often crooked, but since she doesn’t wear them, she skated by on that one. And she has worn red nail polish before, but since it’s not a regular thing and because I’m a merciful husband, I didn’t mark her down for that. The marriage counselor didn’t even expect a score of less than 0, he’d be amazed at what I have to put up with.</p>

<p>It’s interesting that “Can carry on an interesting conversation” and “Good sense of humor” are only worth 1 merit point. A wife with those qualities  whose only flaw is being late for appointments would score a -3. I’m surprised “Doesn’t complain when husband disciplines her” isn’t on the list of merits.</p>

<p>It’s a man’s world, eh?  I’d love to see the Husband’s Chart.</p>

          <p>How do you know that Intelligent Design is not science? “George W. Bush understands it”:http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/02/AR2005080201686.html.</p>

<p>If you want to see evidence that the US actually can make the correct decisions, and overwhelmingly so, in the courts, in public opinion and in education, watch “Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial”:http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Judgment_Day_Intelligent_Design_on_Trial/70086394?trkid=226870. It’ll restore your belief that America is not full of ignorant hillbillies.</p>

<p>Although for Seattle residents, you’ll be embarrassed that a “think tank” on Intelligent Design, “the Discovery Institute”:http://www.discovery.org, is headquartered in Seattle. Even the Catholic Church, hardly the bastion of scientific understanding, started accepting Evolution as far back as the 1950s – 30 years <em>before</em> they accepted that the Earth revolves around the Sun! Yet there are some Americans who believe don’t believe in Evolution cuz da bible tells ‘em so.</p>
