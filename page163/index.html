              <p>The Connolly’s had a brunch on Sunday where Havana had one of her few exposures to a ton of kids:</p>

<p>She held onto her doll and seemed shocked by all the activity. Frankly, it was a bit too much for me as well. Note to self: stop short of 12 kids.</p>

<p>After brunch, we drove out to Grandma’s farm where Havana met some animals:</p>

              <p>The “Dry Fly Distillery”:http://dryflydistilling.com/ is the only distillery in Washington State. They’ve been in business a year and we visited and got a tour from the co-owner. They make vodka and gin right now and will be coming out with a whiskey later this year and a bourbon next year. Most gins are made with juniper berries and maybe one more ingredient, they put several spices in their gin, including hops. Everything they use is grown in Washington State.</p>

<p>I even got to bottle some gin and put the labels on it:</p>

<p>Because I did such a great job bottling, they gave me a free t-shirt. We bought a bottle of gin and vodka and will try a martini as soon as we get home.</p>

              <p>Another day, another brewpub for lunch. I was shocked to find out that Spokane had, not one, but two brewpubs. This time we went to <a href="http://www.washingtonbrewersguild.org/members_nlights.php">Northern Lights Brewing</a>. The beer here was much better than Steam Plant’s beers. I liked almost all of their beers:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2735845492/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2072/2735845492_0ae4a56b4a.jpg" alt="Sample of all beers at Northern Lights Brewing" /></a></p>

<p>The food was much better too.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, Dry Fly Distillery was right next door. Gay had read about Dry Fly months ago and we made a mental note to visit it the next time we were in Spokane. So <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/02/dry-fly-distillery/">we went</a>.</p>

              <p>For lunch, we went to a brewpub right around the corner from the hotel, <a href="http://www.steamplantgrill.com/">The Steam Plant Grill</a>. This was one of the coolest interiors of a restaurant I’ve been in:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2735010651/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3169/2735010651_e0c7839776.jpg" alt="Steam Plant Grill" /></a></p>

<p>It was the steam plant that delivered steam and electricity to downtown Spokane until 1986. They have electricity now, so I’m not sure how long they were without electricity in Spokane.</p>

<p>I got the sampling of all 9 of their beers and about 4 were good, which is a pretty good ratio. I really liked their stout.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2735011249/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3266/2735011249_b40050eff9.jpg" alt="Sample of all the beers at Steam Plant Grill" /></a></p>

<p>Gay went to a girls lunch with a bunch of girls going to the wedding and I took Havana back to the hotel for her afternoon nap. That night, the Murphys, long-time friends of Megan’s family, had a party for all the out-of-town guests at their home. Gay’s mom, dad and aunts watched Havana and Gay and I had another date. We met Jon’s family and friends, had lots of food and wine and Jon was thrown into the pool.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Yes, Jon was thrown into the pool by his dad. Jon then threw his brother into the pool.</p>
