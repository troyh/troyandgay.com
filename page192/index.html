<p>It seems strange that “baseball players are testifying to Congress”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/13/sports/baseball/13cnd-clemens.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin about steroid use. All other sports handle drug use themselves because not doing it will cause fans, believing steroid use to be cheating, to abandon the sport. Sports, of course, are businesses so fewer fans is fewer customers and fewer customers is less money. Why is baseball any different? Because baseball fans don’t care about players’ steroid use.</p>

<p>It could be that baseball fans are more enlightened than other sports fans and feel that performance-enhancing drugs is just another way to compete fairly. Unlikely because baseball fans are also fans of other sports, sports that don’t tolerate it. The more likely reason is that fans know baseball is so boring that steroid use can only make the game more interesting so they look the other way. So the people who run Major League Baseball (MLB) look the other way too.</p>

<p>Now a bi-partisan committee in Congress needs to be involved because tax-payers, usually against their will, fund a large portion of the baseball stadiums that this dumb game is played in and it risks the tax-payers’ investment in the stadiums. The committee “claims it’s about the kids”:http://oversight.house.gov/investigations.asp?ID=244. Which is right?</p>

<p>If the fans don’t care, baseball stadiums will still be filled so there’s no financial risk to tax-payers. Either Congress thinks that baseball fans really do care and that MLB is wrong or they really do care about steroid use in children.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>The percentage of eligible voters who do vote in US Presidential elections from 1960-2004 has averaged 55% but has decreased almost every election year (but is on the increase since a low of 49.1% in 1996).</p>

<p><img src="http://troyh.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/p_2048_1536_ef28b242-2aed-4481-b2ea-6a8b3646d5c1.jpegpix/2008/02/picture-3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Only Switzerland and Poland have lower percentages of voter turnouts than the US. Interestingly, Poland has had only two elections since 1960… I’m not surprised people jump at the chance to express their political opinion once every 20 years! Many countries even “make voting mandatory”:http://www.idea.int/vt/compulsory_voting.cfm, people can be fined, punished or even go to jail for not voting. But even that doesn’t help them achieve 100% voter turnout. Australia has mandatory voting and non-voters risk a fine of between US$275 and US$2,750 – Australia essentially pays people to vote, but only 95% of eligible voters actually voted. Among those countries where voting is voluntary, Malta (94%), Austria (92%), Italy (90%), Iceland (89%) and New Zealand (88%) make up the top five in “voter turnout percentages”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout.</p>

<p>Those who complain about a low US voter turnout cite the percentage and deem it “bad” as if a low percentage means the system isn’t working. People who want a higher percentage imply that a higher percentage of voters would be better than fewer. By this logic, a 100% turnout in a population of 10 people would be preferable to only 10% voter turnout in a population of 1,000. Obviously, it’s not the percentage of people who vote that determines a good outcome, it’s the absolute number of people who vote that determines a good outcome.</p>

<p>Comparing total voters, the top five countries with voter turnout in their most-recent elections were Malta with 377,767 voters, Austria with 7 million voters, Italy with 52 million voters, Iceland with 268,718 voters and New Zealand with 3.6 million voters. If 52 million voters in Italy, 7 million in Austria and only 300,000 people are deemed capable of making a valid choice in elections in those countries, why does the US need more voters then them? We trust a handful of people to make big decisions in our corporations that affect everyone’s finances, we trust 100 senators to make good decisions in Congress that affect how we live, we trust a few people to make decisions in running our schools, we trust a handful of people in the FDA to make proper decisions for food and drug products that are sold, but we don’t believe 122 million people is enough people to make a valid choice between two Presidential candidates?</p>

<p>In 1960, the total number of eligible voters in the US was 109 million and 63% of them voted. That’s 68 million votes. If someone in 1960 suggested that the turnout was too low, which I’m sure someone did, they’d have been ecstatic with all 109 million voters voting. So 109 million people voting would be enough people voting to ensure a good democratic system. Today we have more than that voting, so we should be able to pick a President. If that’s still not good enough, the US population continues to grow and the number of voters has always been increasing, so eventually we’ll hit the magic number of required voters, but will people <em>still</em> complain about a low voter turnout? Probably.</p>

<p><img src="http://troyh.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/p_2048_1536_ef28b242-2aed-4481-b2ea-6a8b3646d5c1.jpegpix/2008/02/picture-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Is the problem with low turnout a sign that voters are disenfranchised? Possibly, but statistically, as long as voters are a representative sample of the population, it doesn’t matter. Are US voters a representative sample of the population? There’s no way to know for sure, but if you compare the national voter turnout to each state’s turnout and find that they are close, it’s reasonable to conclude that the voters are a representative sample. In the 2000 election, “they are comparable”:http://www.eac.gov/clearinghouse/docs/voter-registration-and-turnout-2000.pdf/attachment_download/file. The lowest turnout was 43.1% (Texas) and the highest was 66.4% (Alaska) and the median voter turnout is 53%, again very close to the 51.3% national turnout in 2000. You could go even further into counties, but I suspect you’ll find the same percentages.</p>

<p>Shouldn’t we still strive for 100% voter turnout? Wouldn’t that make for a more perfect democracy? Not necessarily. The founding fathers of our country didn’t want a perfect democracy, so they created the Electoral College. But that aside, in a democracy, voters are free to voice their opinion, but they are also free to not have an opinion. By not requiring people to vote, we have a more perfect democracy than we would by restricting choice, i.e., removing the option not to vote. But even if the US had the impossible 100% voter turnout, there would be 240 million votes cast. Would 240 million people make a different decision than the decision that 122 million people made? Not likely. In fact, trying to reach 100% could be worse. The great thing about voluntary voting is that voters decide for themselves whether or not they <em>should</em> vote. The people who don’t vote don’t vote because they don’t care to vote, they know they aren’t as informed as they should be to make a decision or they don’t care enough about the outcome. Do we really want these people to vote just so we can claim a higher percentage? I don’t think so. The people who voluntarily vote are the <em>best</em> people to vote.</p>

<p>We should be happy that the other 45% <em>aren’t</em> voting and even better, that the majority of eligible voters <em>want</em> to vote. If the turnout percentage rises, we should hope that those new voters are <em>more</em> informed than the existing voters. If we blindly encourage their votes, we are encouraging a bad decision.</p>

              <p>Back from a 9-day vacation in Mexico, between Puerto Vallarta and Sayulita. “A photoset is on Flickr”:http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/sets/72157603774032038/. Our friends Jon and Megan also came down for most of the time too and Jon made great margaritas.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2225520109/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2250/2225520109_3201bf6d10.jpg" alt="IMG_1492.JPG" /></a></p>

<p>The weather was great, the food was good and I spent most of the time relaxing and reading. I finished two books and started a third which is the most productive reading I’ve ever done on a vacation.</p>

<p>One “trick” Havana does now is to smile at the camera when she’s photographed. I don’t know how she learned this, but as soon as she notices the camera pointing at her, she quickly smiles. I captured a video of her doing this, which shows how she does it only for the photo as she quickly returns to whatever she was doing before the photo:</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT6jXRUXEKg&amp;rel=1]</p>

<p>We visited the town of Bucerias for dinner and it happened to be on the final day of their town festival. The streets were crowded with food stands and there was a carnival in the town square. When we were in France in 2005, pre-baby, we stumbled on a similar festival and we watched all the kids ride the merry-go-round and all their parents taking photos of them and imagined one day we’d be those people. Here’s proof:</p>

<p>I’m glad to be back in Seattle where I can drink good beer and wine again, though.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>“Time Capsule”:http://www.apple.com/timecapsule/ Time Machine in Leopard is worthless for laptop users unless they use their laptop exclusively as a desktop. Apple made a new Airport Extreme base station that includes a hard drive to do Time Machine backups wirelessly. I assume (and hope) it works wired too. This is a good product since you can let several machines backup to it so you don’t need to buy an external hard drive for each computer, but it still is only a halfway solution for laptop users. Apple needs to make it possible to use Time Machine online over .Mac so you get your backups wherever you are, not just at home or the office. $299 is reasonable for the 500GB version given that an Airport Extreme without a hard drive is $179. $499 seems a bit high for an additional 500GB of storage. Note that it only works with Time Machine, you can’t even use the drive as network storage.</p>

<p>“iPhone update.”:http://www.apple.com/iphone/ This is a great update. I can now add web bookmarks to the main set of icons and create several pages of icons. There’s a few web sites I check regularly on the iPhone, so this will be very handy. The Google Maps feature seems much improved with “faux GPS”. Oddly, though, it thinks I’m in Des Moines, WA when I’m on Vashon Island. I guess my cellular service is from 2 miles away across Puget Sound.</p>

<p><em>Movie Rentals.</em> The benefit of a downloadable movie rental service is that there is no physical supply problem, everyone can download the popular new movies and watch them that day. Traditional rental services never have the popular new movies available right away. So Apple’s going to take advantage of this natural benefit, right? Nope. The movies are released <em>30 days after</em> the DVD release.  This is crazy, I can get any new movie from Netflix within 30 days, usually within seven days, sometimes even the day it’s released. I’m sure this is a restriction that the studios put on Apple to protect their DVD sales, but it’s a negative for iTunes compared to Netflix. For pricing, new releases are $3.99 and $4.99 for HD quality, older movies are $2.99 and $3.99 for HD quality. These prices are a bit high compared to Netflix, depending on how many movies a month you watch. I watch about 15 movies per month and pay $35/month for Netflix, so with Netflix I pay $2.33 per movie and get 48-hour turnaround time, so Netflix is cheaper and generally more convenient than movie rentals from iTunes. And Netflix doesn’t charge higher prices for HD quality. Granted, the bandwidth required to download HD quality is much higher than standard definition so Apple has to charge more for HD, but I would expect this price difference to disappear eventually. The other gripe with the service is that you have 30 days after downloading to start the movie, which is far more than necessary, but only 24 hours to finish the movie, which is less than enough. These numbers should have been adjusted. I’ve started many movies and stopped it to watch the next night, but the 24 hour limit will prevent that, which seems pointless. Give me 48 or 72 hours to finish the movie.</p>

<p>“Apple TV.”:http://www.apple.com/appletv/ Since watching movies on your computer or iPod is not ideal, they updated Apple TV to work with iTunes to rent movies without involving a computer. This seems to be a software update only, which is good so existing Apple TV owners (are there any?) don’t have throw out their boxes. And the price is lowered to $229. The problem with Apple TV is that it’s really only useful to rent movies from Apple. It’s like a DVD player that only works with DVDs rented from Blockbuster. It’ll be interesting to see if iTunes movie rentals is a success.</p>

<p>“MacBook Air.”:http://www.apple.com/macbookair/ Ultra-portables fail in the marketplace because they’re slower and more expensive than regular laptops. They’re lighter, but once you accept that you have to carry a bunch of accessories that they couldn’t fit inside the laptop the total weight is the same and it’s less convenient to use. The MacBook Air is no different. It starts at $1799, has a 13.3” screen and weighs 3 pounds. A 15-inch MacBook Pro only costs $200 more and you get a bigger screen, a CPU that is almost 30% faster, a hard drive that is 50% bigger and is only 2 pounds (66%) heavier. Maybe that 2 pounds is significant if you only carry a laptop and no laptop bag, but once it’s in a laptop bag the 2 pounds is insignificant. And it has no ethernet port, which would make it impossible to get online at hotels that don’t have WiFi (yes, there are many still in my experience), although you can get a USB/Ethernet adapter. The battery is sealed, so the laptop lasts only as long as the battery can hold a charge. You sacrifice a lot to save 2 pounds. Besides, Apple already has the best ultra-portable: iPhone. My guess is that the MacBook Air will sell as poorly as the 12” PowerBook that Apple discontinued.</p>

<p>“Watch the keynote presentation”:http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/f27853y2/event/index.html?internal=fj2l3s9dm, they even play a Belle &amp; Sebastian song during it.</p>
