              <p>I’m not a sports dork, so I’m pretty out-of-touch with that world, but living in Seattle you hear about three sports teams: The Mariners, The Sonics and The UW Huskies (no one talks about the Seahawks cuz they suck). Yes, believe it or not, there are people fascinated by a college football team. Anyway, we walked by a newspaper stand today and the headline (yes, the headline) was that <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/134980728_webneuheisel12.html">Rick Neuheisel was fired</a>. Neuheisel is the coach of the Huskies.</p>

<p>This guy is one of the highest-paid college football coaches in the country, making millions per year. He got fired because he gambled and then lied about it. Then he claimed he believed that UW’s policy allowed for gambling on NCAA games. Then why’d he lie about it?</p>

<p>If you make millions a year, do you really need to gamble for money? Why not gamble for beers? Or for dinner? Something that won’t get you fired from a cush job. And this is just weeks after the coach of the other Washington college football team <a href="http://www.datelinealabama.com/article/2003/05/04/4470_sports_art.php3">was fired</a> for a drinking binge involving a stripper who he took back to his hotel room and let her order one of everything off the room service menu.</p>

<p>Stupid is as stupid does.</p>

              <p>Had to run into Seattle this morning. My SIM in my cell phone mysteriously died. Nobody can tell me why SIMs suddenly die, but T-Mobile confirms they do. Dropped Gay’s car off at the shop to fix a couple recalls we never got around to having done. Lunch at Elliot Bay Brewery, then picked up some new CDs: <a href="http://www.radiohead.com/">Radiohead</a>’s <em>Hail To The Thief</em>, <a href="http://www.grandaddylandscape.com/">Grandaddy</a>’s <em>Sumday</em> and <a href="http://www.yolatengo.net/">Yo La Tengo</a>’s <em>Summer Sun</em> before hopping on the ferry home.</p>

              <p>Just finished <a href="http://www.transportermovie.com/home.html">The Transporter</a>, an action movie with the guy from <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&amp;cf=info&amp;id=1800023087">Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</a> (which I loved) and <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/movies/reviews/movie/386066">Snatch</a>. The plot is pretty undeveloped and oddly unexplained, but the point of the movie is the action – which is pretty good. The initial driving scene is great (in a BMW 735!) then his choice of cars plummets throughout the movie as does the action in the car scenes. Lots of fight scenes, mostly typical, but there’s a cool fight scene in oil and uses parts of a bike pretty well. Overall, entertaining but I was glad it was only 92 minutes.</p>

<p>Tomorrow night’s movie is <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/XXX-1112845/reviews.php">XXX</a>, which promises to be the dumbest movie  since the last Steven Seagal movie.</p>
