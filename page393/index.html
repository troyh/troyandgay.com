              <p>Finally watched <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/triplex/">XXX</a>. If you only care about action in a movie, stop here, you won’t hate it. If you want more than action in a movie, stop here, you’ll hate it. This movie is James Bond for Dummies. His name is Xander and he calls himself “X”, but the movie is called “XXX”. “XXX” is easier to remember for 14 year-olds than “007” I guess (numbers are hard).</p>

<p>As predicted, this movie is downright dumb. I could go on and on about the bad plot (world domination, duh!), the unnecessary action, the ridiculousness of driving an American muscle car through the streets of Prague, the complete lack of subtlety (they explain everything to you as if you are a moron, which you will feel like after watching this movie), the acting of Vin Diesel and everyone else, the inane dialogue that even had subtitles for the Czech characters (one of the subtitles actually was “<em>Get him fast! Kill him now!</em>”), and the pathetic one-liners (before being thrown off a plane, X asks “Where are my peanuts?”, the comedy is <em>that</em> good). And I won’t even ask why <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Name?Jackson,+Samuel+L.">Samuel Jackson</a> is in this – I’ll just try to forget that (as well as the bad scarred face he had).</p>

<p>The action isn’t even inventive. <a href="/archives/2003/06/001468.php">The Transporter</a> had much more original action scenes. They even stole the Q character from Bond, except this guy is a kid who invents the stupidest things you could imagine: a high-tech gun that is a 6-barrel revolver, missiles that launch out of the headlights in the car (a sure end to your after-dark car chase) and paintball darts filled with red paint (to simulate blood, they carefully explain to you <em>twice</em>). And of course, the ending is a (not at all subtle) tie-in to the sequel.</p>

              <p>Saw the widely-acclaimed <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/movies/reviews/movie/1688385">8 Mile</a> last night. I was worried that it would be full of macho rapping (Disclaimer: I’m not a rap fan <em>at all</em>) like the 80s break-dancing movies and the 70s roller-skating/disco movies were, but it wasn’t, in fact there was very little rapping. That was good. The rest of the movie wasn’t. Boring story – you see the end coming from 8 miles away. Eminem basically played himself, except that his character is anti-violence, pro-civil rights, and get this, he’s a caring guy always trying to do what’s best for females. Remember, Eminem is the nitwit who has been up on <a href="http://www.freep.com/news/metro/rap8_20000608.htm">gun and assault charges</a> and raps about violence against women, Jews, Blacks and homosexuals. Maybe he is a good actor?</p>

              <p>For our first “day off” in I don’t know how long, we drove out to <a href="http://www.ptguide.com/">Port Townsend</a> for the day. Had lunch at a brewpub in downtown Port Townsend, walked around and then took the dogs to the beach where Ouzo learned to swim.</p>
