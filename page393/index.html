            <p>Recipezaar Corporate Headquarters actually observed Memorial Day this year – holidays are not big in the startup world.  Troy and I did what the rest of the world did: worked in the yard, relaxed, ate salmon.  I don’t think I even checked e-mail!</p>

            <p>Got a new <a href="http://www.stihlusa.com/blowers/BG85.html">power blower/vac</a> yesterday rather than fix the one that was on its last legs. The driveway and patio will never be dirty again!</p>

<p>I have a fairly unique last name, Hakala, but I’ve run into a couple other unrelated Hakalas in the past, but yesterday I met David Hakala who lives on Vashon. He sold me the blower at the hardware store. Odd, eh?</p>

<p>Yesterday I spent barely any time at all on the computer. I have a hard time staying away from the computer for more than a few hours and the first thing I do in the morning is check the performance graphs of <a href="http://recipezaar.com">the site</a> just to ease my mind that nothing bad happened during the night. I can also check the statistics on my cell phone, but I don’t see the pretty graphs I do on the computer. It’s an addiction.</p>

            <p>Gay went to Seattle yesterday and stayed overnight to help with a friend’s baby shower. I stayed home with the dogs and had a pretty relaxing day (working, but fun &amp; relaxing).</p>

<p>Had a delicious salmon dinner and some white wine. No movies tonight, two stages of the Giro d’Italia, <em>60 Minutes</em> and <em>Sopranos</em>.</p>

            <p>We’re on a movie kick – 3 movies in 3 days. That’s more movies than we’ve seen in the previous 3 months.</p>

<p>Last night, we watched Todd Haynes’ <a href="http://www.farfromheavenmovie.com/">Far From Heaven</a>. It was set in 1957 and just like <em>Catch Me If You Can</em>, the set design felt like the period. The movie was good – it was nominated for 4 Academy Awards, after all. It was filmed in the tradition of the movies at the time, apparently mimicking <a href="http://entertainment.msn.com/celebs/celeb.aspx?mp=b&amp;c=135093">Douglas Sirk</a>’s style. It’s interesting to see how far the US has come on racism, interracial relationships and homosexuality (“Oh! That word!”). Nobody minded if she (<a href="http://www.julianne-moore.com/">Julianne Moore</a>) was seen talking to her black female housekeeper but everyone was “in a clamor” when she talked with her black male gardener. And her husband who was gay went to a psychologist who suggested medication and electro-shock therapy to “cure” him. The US has a <em>long</em> way to go still on these issues, but in just 40 years (2 generations) the difference is surprising. Or maybe the US is just less blatant about its prejudices.</p>

<p>The other thing that I find interesting about movies that this movie imitated is how they portray the “perfect life”, the “perfect family”, etc. The innocence is appealing, I admit, but nobody truly lived like that then and they don’t now either. Even watching <em><a href="http://www.timvp.com/beaver.html">Leave It To Beaver</a></em> reruns as a kid I knew it was all fake. But I’m not so sure most people do and Hollywood unknowingly set the impossible standard for Americans. Martha Stewart, to me, is the modern equivalent. Image sells and reality doesn’t, I guess.</p>

            <p>We talked again with our neighbors and things are better. No more animosity on either side, I think.</p>
