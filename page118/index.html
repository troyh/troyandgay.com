        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>For Saturday evening I wanted to have a special beer so I looked into the beer/wine fridge for something new to try. I decided on the <a href="http://www.ommegang.com/index.php?mcat=1&amp;scat=6">Ommegang Ommegeddon</a> because Ommegang is a great beer-maker and even though it has brettanomyces in it, which I don’t like, if it can be used for a good beer Ommegang should be able to do it. And it’s dry-hopped, which I really like.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>Ommegang’s description:</p>

<blockquote>Ommegeddon is 8% ABV Belgian-style ale with a wild twist -- a dose of Brettanomyces yeast and a blast of dry hopping. It's a strong blonde ale with a sharp citrus flavor that, like the other Ommegang ales, has a dry finish. Its dryness and funkiness begat the name of Ommegeddon -- for the time when the forces of light and dark battle for world dominion. It's time for you to pick your side.</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, it’s bottle-conditioned and the bottle was on its side in the fridge so the yeast sediment had not settled at the bottom. So I put it in the regular fridge for Sunday instead.</p>

<p>It’s a very light-colored beer and I didn’t detect any hop aromas at all. I figured it was too cold and I’d let it warm up a little. But then it smelled like a musty basement. Blech. The taste was nothing special although it wasn’t as sour as I’d have expected with the brettanomyces.</p>

<p>I ended up not finishing the little bit I poured and decided to treat myself to something I knew I’d like: Dogfish Head’s Black &amp; Blue. I had this <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/06/01/dogfish-head-black-blue/">last year in June</a> and really liked it. But that day was hot and today was cold and rainy so I didn’t expect it to be as enjoyable. It didn’t beat my memory of the last one I had and it tasted more like a fruit-punch beer, but I liked it a lot.</p>

          <p>For the first time in her life, Havana didn’t wear a diaper today. She wore “big girl underpants” as the next step in her potty-training. It wasn’t a successful step, she had a few mistakes and ended the day in a diaper. But she was very proud of herself!</p>

<p>She almost always uses the toilet for #2 and about half of her #1s. My guess is that in 6 months she won’t be wearing diapers anymore.</p>

          <p>“FeedFlix.com”:http://feedflix.com analyzes your Netflix history and generates a report. Our report:</p>

<blockquote>You have been a Netflix member since February 2002 and have returned 748 titles to date
You most recently returned a movie on 07/Apr/09 i.e. about 19 hours ago
You keep titles at home for an average of 12 days
You see 15.7 titles by DVD and 5.7 titles by Instant Watch each month
Your cost/DVD rental is $0.89. Your cost/movie (including Instant Watch) is $0.66
You're in the 19th percentile. i.e., 19% of FeedFlixers pay less than you per movie</blockquote>

<p>According to that, we pay 66¢ per movie that we watch which makes Netflix quite a good deal for us! The math doesn’t seem to work out for me, though. Most of the 7 years we’ve been a Netflix member we were on the $20/month plan. We suspended our account for about 18 months (tried out Blockbuster’s competitor) and a year ago we upgraded to the $36/mo plan. So we’ve spent about $1,500 on Netflix over the last 7 years. Watching 748 movies (that’s 11 movies/month on average), that’s $2.02/movie by my math. Still a good deal compared to a local video rental store (and far more convenient) but not as good as FeedFlix suggests.</p>

<p>I found out about this site from Leo Laporte who discovered that <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/1e481452-14c0-012e-6135-59f0bced8d51/OMG-According-to-Feedflix-I-m-spending-92-97-per/">he spends $92 per movie</a>. He could buy the DVD of every movie he watches and cut his movie bill by 75%.</p>

          <p>While in Portland, we picked up several beers from “The Bruery”:http://www.thebruery.com/. I’d never had their beers before but I am very impressed. I have taken a liking to Belgian beers which surprises me because I’ve never cared for them much before. I guess I’ve never had a good one; or my tastes are changing in my old age.</p>

<p>Gay and I shared this on Saturday evening after I spent all day in the sun washing both cars. It may have just been that I was tired and wanting to sit down and relax and this beer happened to be a perfect fit, but this was one of the best beer experiences I’ve had in a long time – it was a light and refreshing beer.</p>
