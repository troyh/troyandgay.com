          </h3>
            <p>We went to <a href="http://www.harrods.com/HarrodsStore/Default.aspx?CID=ppc">Harrod’s</a> so Gay could see it (I had been there years ago) and to get lunch stuff at their several rooms of gourmet delis. We walked to Hyde Park and ate lunch near the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Memorial">Albert Memorial</a> before hiking across the park into Kensington Gardens to the <a href="http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/kensington_gardens/diana_playground.cfm">Princess Diana Memorial Playground</a> (no, not Paris or Monte Carlo, ha ha ha).</p>

<p>The playground is a fancy playground complete with a big pirate ship as well as the usual swings, slides and various climbing area. It was built as a “tribute for a Princess who loved the innocence of childhood”. Unfortunately, it’s mobbed with screaming kids so you have to wait to even get into it. But Havana loved it and that’s worth a visit to me.</p>

<p>Both kids were tired as it took us a long time to get to the playground given Havana’s preference for walking most of the way. Rather than walk the 2.5 miles back home, we decided to grab a taxi and get back quickly. Both kids fell asleep in the taxi.</p>

<p>Eric stopped by to say goodbye as he’s leaving tomorrow morning for Prague. Later, Mark and Lee came by after work also to say goodbye since they’re leaving Saturday morning to go to Seattle for a couple weeks.</p>

            <p>After my run in the gym and the kids’ mid-day naps, I was assigned the job of babysitting so Gay and Eric could go to the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/">Tate Modern museum</a> for the afternoon. I spent the afternoon helping Hudson practice his crawling (he can go anywhere he wants to…. backwards) and entertaining Havana between shows on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/">CBeebies</a>. Before Gay and Eric got here, Havana and I watched <em>Kung Fu Panda</em>.</p>

<p>At 7, all five of us went down to a local pub, the <a href="http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/clubs_bars/venue-524.php">Rose &amp; Crown</a>, to watch the Championship League Final, kind of the Super Bowl of European soccer. It’s odd that they have such a big game on a Wednesday night. We had dinner and watched <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2009/may/27/manchester-united-barcelona-champions-league-final">Barcelona surprisingly defeat Manchester United</a>.</p>

<p>And yes, the correct term for the sport is “soccer”. Most people think that “football” is correct because you use your feet to control the ball, but football was a term used a long time ago to describe team games played on your feet as opposed to on a horse. There were many forms of football: rugby football (rugby), gridiron football (the game the Pittsburgh Steelers play) and association football (soccer). The term “soccer” was coined by the English in the late 1800s as a slang form of <em>association</em>. The term <em>football</em> is applied to the sport that is most popular in a given country. So in Europe, soccer is the most popular game so it’s called “football”, in Australia, “football” refers to rugby football and in America and Canada, “football” is the name given to gridiron football. So using the term soccer is less ambiguous than the term football.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Gay took the kids and went to Clerkenwell with Eric for the afternoon. I stayed at home and did some work for the first time on the trip, which is my form of relaxation. They walked around, took the kids to a playground and then went to dinner at another gastropub, <a href="http://www.thepeasant.co.uk/">The Peasant</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3569927942/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2440/3569927942_6ee61b9ae7.jpg" alt="IMG_0404" /></a></p>

<p>Incidentally, it’s pronounced “Clarkenwell” in the Queen’s English. Nobody knows what you’re talking about when you say it like it’s spelled. Speaking of pronunciations, “Grosvenor” is pronounced “Grove-ner”, “Leicester” is pronounced “Ly-ster”, “Gloucester” is similarly pronounced “Gly-ster” and “Hertford” is pronounced “Hartford” (they really hate Es, I guess) – even Mark, an American, didn’t understand us when we said “Hertford”. They must not tell UK kids to “sound it out” when learning to read.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Of Gordon Ramsay’s restaurants, <a href="http://www.gordonramsay.com/murano/">Murano</a> was the only one where we could get a reservation on short notice. We knew we were coming here months ago so we really should have made reservations at his flagship restaurant (which requires a 2-month reservation) months ago. But we didn’t.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3566512780/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3642/3566512780_e99e3520c9.jpg" alt="Halibut" /></a></p>

<p>We got a babysitter and walked to Murano which is nearby. This is only the third time we’ve ever had a babysitter for the kids and the first time it was a complete stranger. The other two times it was on a personal recommendation from friends we knew we could trust who live in the city we were visiting so we were comfortable. And for this babysitter, the hotel works with a service for babysitters that does background checks and they don’t work cheaply so we were reasonably confident that they would be experienced and not a crazy person, but it was still a little uncomfortable for us to be so trusting and leave the kids with a stranger. During the hour before we left, she seemed to be very experienced with kids and Havana really took to her right away, which gave us some confidence that she really does do this for a living. Parenthood can turn you into a perpetual worrier with irrational thoughts so on our walk to the restaurant, we talked about the bad things that could happen and eventually to the worst case possibility of her taking the kids and rushing them into a waiting van to sell them on the Russian black market. But we’re trying to not be one of <em>those</em> parents and worrying doesn’t affect anything but your own state of mind, so by the time we got to the restaurant we had convinced ourselves to put it out of our minds and have a relaxing dinner.</p>

<p>We both had the <a href="http://www.gordonramsay.com/murano/menus/tastingmenu/">tasting menu</a> and it was fantastic. Each plate on a tasting menu is normally small but each of these was a good size. We also got the optional cheese plate and were full by the end of the 8 courses. I’ve been to my share of nice restaurants but I am always amazed at how perfect the dishes are – always cooked to perfection and presented beautifully. Everything we had was fantastic and the service was impeccable. An entire place setting was on the table when we sat down and was completely removed as soon as we ordered our food. What’s the point of that? We ordered a bottle of wine, it was shown to us and taken to a nearby table to be decanted, inspected over candlelight (?) and even tasted by the server. The wine was brought to our table with the bottle and the foil put back in place so that it appeared to be unopened. I’ve never seen any of that done before.</p>

<p>A total of six different people served us our dishes, removed finished plates and refilled our wine and water glasses. Normally I hate restaurants where there’s constantly someone at your table doing something, but these people knew how to be as inconspicuous as possible and never interrupted our conversation. Our reservation was at 6:30 and at 9:20 we were finished but they didn’t seem to care how long we stayed even though we were politely warned when we arrived that there was another reservation for our table at 9pm – we assumed two-and-a-half hours would be plenty of time. Nobody ever came by to ask us if we wanted our bill, they only came by to deliver a set of candies and never once looked at us while we quietly waited for the one who would bring us our bill. It never came so we eventually caught the eye of a server and asked for it.</p>

<p>We had a nice walk home through the quiet streets and light rain and best of all, found the kids at home and safe.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Hudson’s 9 months old today. He’s starting to learn to crawl and can push himself backwards easily but not forwards. In the last few days he’s started to work on getting up on his knees but hasn’t yet figured out that he should move his knees and hands forward. He can take a few steps if you hold his hands in the air and he can stand by himself against furniture for a few minutes until he falls. He’s continuing to develop his lungs and can be very loud when he wants to be. He has successfully put food into his mouth, but still prefers that someone else do it for him. He can sit up on his own very well at this point but will often fall over, much to his surprise. Minutes after this photo was taken, he did a face-plant right into the street.</p>
