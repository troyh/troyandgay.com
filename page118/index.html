            <div class="post-content">
              <p>This morning we took the kids to the castle for a “Falconry” show. It turns out that there was only one falcon but there was also a hawk and an owl. And we got up close with them. I assumed we’d watch birds land on the guy’s arm over and over. The falcon is considered too dangerous to be close to people so for that bird, he went down below the castle and the bird did several dives near him and away from people. As he explained, the owl would also be dangerous to people if it wasn’t so dumb and you were dumb enough to not move while it finally figured out to attack you.</p>

<p>Right after the show, we took a walk to North Bovey for lunch. The maps weren’t very clear on the route but after a few false starts and after asking a groundskeeper, we found the footpath off the castle grounds and through the woods along the Bovey River (really a stream) to North Bovey. It was a little muddy and difficult to maneuver the stroller along the path and we had to hop a couple fences, but eventually we made it to the town and to <a href="http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/45/4555/Ring_of_Bells_Inn/North_Bovey">The Ring of Bells Inn</a>, the only place for food in North Bovey, for lunch. Luckily, the food was pretty good.</p>

<p>Not wanting to walk back along the trail, we arranged for the cars (Range Rovers, of course) from Bovey Castle to pick us up and take us back. Both kids fell asleep on the 10-minute drive back.</p>

<p>After afternoon naps, we drove the golf cart through the castle grounds to eat an early dinner at the castle’s casual restaurant. There’s another nice restaurant but it requires that men wear a jacket and probably not a great for a little girl who likes to run around and say hello to people. Incidentally, this place has London Pride on tap and keg (ahhh, CO2, how I love thee!) as opposed to a handpumped cask, so I had that for the first time.</p>

<p>Havana loves the golf cart, what she calls a “tractor”. On the way home, she sat on my lap and steered and was very proud of herself for driving. It brought back a memory of me as a kid sitting on my dad’s lap and steering our car (a Datsun hatchback, I think). Once we got back to our place, she didn’t want to get out of the cart so I sat with her and we pretended to drive around, including a stop at the library and at the grocery store, places I think she knows she rides to when at home.</p>

<p>I have a bunch of beers I bought when <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/05/29/fullers-brewery/">we visited the Fuller’s Brewery</a> that Gay has asked me to drink so we don’t have to pack them and carry them again. I always do as I’m told, as long as what I’m told to do is drink beer. So I tried the Gale Brewery’s Old Prize Ale, which is the most interesting beer I’ve had yet. It’s almost like a sweet barley wine. After that, I had the Fuller’s Old Winter Ale which is maltier than an ESB and less bitter, not my favorite way to go, but one of the better beers I’ve had here. I still have three 500ml beers and one 330ml beer to go, which will take some effort to drink in one day before we leave Wednesday morning.</p>

              <p>Last night we ordered room service, got suckered into watching <em>Britain’s Got Talent</em> and saw Susan Boyle <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6400081.ece">come in 2nd</a> to the most ridiculous dance troupe I think I’ve ever seen (Britain has talent, they just don’t know they do, I guess), packed our suitcases and got the kids to bed at a reasonable time so we could be checked-out by 9am to catch the train at 10am. We were in the taxi and on our way a few minutes early so we made it to Paddington Station in plenty of time to wait for our train.</p>

<p>The train left right on time; it was scheduled to leave at 9:57am and at 9:57am we were leaving the station. In America, no one would have bet that train would have left before noon. We rode through the English countryside and by 12:30pm we were in Exeter and getting into a taxi to take us to Bovey Castle in Dartmoor National Park.</p>

<p>It’s a 45 minute drive to Bovey so we asked the taxi driver to stop on the way so we could get lunch. His recommendation was Pizza Hut. That’s an indication of how bad the food would be on the way. We didn’t take his recommendation and ended up at a little family pub in Moretonhampstead. The food was not very good, Gay’s grilled “stuffed chicken breast” (meaning it had stuffing on the side) was inedible but I could at least eat my minced beef with onion and gravy with a puff pastry, but not the potatoes. After lunch, we got back in the taxi and rode the windy road through the hills to <a href="http://www.boveycastle.com/">Bovey Castle</a>. Havana fell fast asleep in my arms, so she got a short afternoon nap.</p>

<p>After getting assistance from the staff to pay the taxi driver since we didn’t  have enough cash, we checked-in and were given a tour of the place by the friendly staff. We relaxed in our room and then went to dinner at the casual restaurant in the castle. We had a much better dinner than we did lunch and ate on the balcony of the castle overlooking the grounds and the hills.</p>

              <p>After 4 years, we finally visited the Fuller’s Brewery. When we visited London in 2005 our taxi from Heathrow went right by it but because of the terrorist bombings that day, the brewery was closed to the public all week. So we left London without visiting. But today we finally made the trek out to Chiswick. I’ve been to a lot of breweries in the US, but the oldest, I think, dates back to the early 1980s. This brewery has been here for <a href="http://www.fullers.co.uk/rte.asp?id=34">over 350 years</a> (it became Fuller’s in 1845).</p>

<p>It’s not that far, just a half-dozen stops and one transfer on the Tube, a 15-minute walk through Turnham Green to Chiswick and there it is. We had lunch at the Mawson Arms, the pub at the brewery. The food was nothing special, although Havana really liked her egg salad sandwich (she <em>loves</em> eggs!). But the ESBs we had were the freshest we’ve had yet and you could tell they were fresh because even on a handpump they had some carbonation.</p>

<p>We didn’t get to go on the brewery tour although there was 2 slots available for the 2pm tour because they don’t allow anyone under the age of 14. Gay offered to let me go and she’d take the kids to a park or for a walk but I opted out. After lunch, we went to the gift shop and I got a few beers that you can only get at the brewery: a 1999 Vintage Ale, a 2002 Vintage Ale, Fuller’s Old Winter Ale, Fuller’s Anniversary Ale (brewed in 2005 to commemorate 160 years of brewing) and two beers from Gale brewery (which is owned by Fuller’s): Prize Old Ale and Last Drop, the last beer ever to brewed at the Gale brewery before Fuller’s took over brewing.</p>

<p>I also got a couple tulip glasses with the Fuller’s logo on them, an ESB polo shirt and Havana picked out a little Fuller’s horse and buggy:</p>

<p>On the way back to the Tube station we stopped at a playground for Havana to get some of her energy out. It worked, she fell asleep in the stroller and slept through being lifted up the stairs to the train, through the train ride and the walk back home.</p>

<p>Gay, Havana and Hudson took a nap when we got home and I chilled the Chiswick Bitter I got at the brewery and tested out my new glass:</p>

              <p>We went to <a href="http://www.harrods.com/HarrodsStore/Default.aspx?CID=ppc">Harrod’s</a> so Gay could see it (I had been there years ago) and to get lunch stuff at their several rooms of gourmet delis. We walked to Hyde Park and ate lunch near the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Memorial">Albert Memorial</a> before hiking across the park into Kensington Gardens to the <a href="http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/kensington_gardens/diana_playground.cfm">Princess Diana Memorial Playground</a> (no, not Paris or Monte Carlo, ha ha ha).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3573524966/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2484/3573524966_0a0b84dd49.jpg" alt="Lunch in Hyde Park" /></a></p>

<p>The playground is a fancy playground complete with a big pirate ship as well as the usual swings, slides and various climbing area. It was built as a “tribute for a Princess who loved the innocence of childhood”. Unfortunately, it’s mobbed with screaming kids so you have to wait to even get into it. But Havana loved it and that’s worth a visit to me.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3572722545/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3235/3572722545_2bf93af5b2.jpg" alt="Princess Diana Memorial Playground" /></a></p>

<p>Both kids were tired as it took us a long time to get to the playground given Havana’s preference for walking most of the way. Rather than walk the 2.5 miles back home, we decided to grab a taxi and get back quickly. Both kids fell asleep in the taxi.</p>

<p>Eric stopped by to say goodbye as he’s leaving tomorrow morning for Prague. Later, Mark and Lee came by after work also to say goodbye since they’re leaving Saturday morning to go to Seattle for a couple weeks.</p>

              <p>After my run in the gym and the kids’ mid-day naps, I was assigned the job of babysitting so Gay and Eric could go to the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/">Tate Modern museum</a> for the afternoon. I spent the afternoon helping Hudson practice his crawling (he can go anywhere he wants to…. backwards) and entertaining Havana between shows on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/">CBeebies</a>. Before Gay and Eric got here, Havana and I watched <em>Kung Fu Panda</em>.</p>

<p>At 7, all five of us went down to a local pub, the <a href="http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/clubs_bars/venue-524.php">Rose &amp; Crown</a>, to watch the Championship League Final, kind of the Super Bowl of European soccer. It’s odd that they have such a big game on a Wednesday night. We had dinner and watched <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2009/may/27/manchester-united-barcelona-champions-league-final">Barcelona surprisingly defeat Manchester United</a>.</p>

<p>And yes, the correct term for the sport is “soccer”. Most people think that “football” is correct because you use your feet to control the ball, but football was a term used a long time ago to describe team games played on your feet as opposed to on a horse. There were many forms of football: rugby football (rugby), gridiron football (the game the Pittsburgh Steelers play) and association football (soccer). The term “soccer” was coined by the English in the late 1800s as a slang form of <em>association</em>. The term <em>football</em> is applied to the sport that is most popular in a given country. So in Europe, soccer is the most popular game so it’s called “football”, in Australia, “football” refers to rugby football and in America and Canada, “football” is the name given to gridiron football. So using the term soccer is less ambiguous than the term football.</p>
