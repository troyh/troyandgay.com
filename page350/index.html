            <p>I don’t know who is more stupid, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A64800-2003Aug29?language=printer">the kid</a> who made the Blaster-variant virus or the FBI that took a week to find him. He put the URL to his own web server in the code with a domain name registered to himself and he bragged about it on his web site (<a href="http://216.239.53.104/search?q=cache:FEZleHDR3mcJ:t33kid.com/hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8">Google cache</a>) and the executable’s name is his own nickname.</p>

            <p>Ugh! I hate when I read about <a href="http://www.kingcountyjournal.com/sited/story/html/141697">bicyclists getting hit by cars</a>. But it sounds like she was riding on the sidewalk, which is not a good idea.</p>

            <p>This is probably how <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1477729/08282003/spears_britney.jhtml?headlines=true">the kiss</a> happened:</p>

<p><em>Madonna, an expert at crafting moments like these, was likely the kiss architect, and didnt have to clear it with anyone but herself. Britney on the other hand probably deferred Madonnas plan to her managers, who then held target-marketing studies, clicked through a series of PowerPoint pie charts in dimly-lit conference rooms, crunched Excel spreadsheet numbers, calibrated their Britney-Coming-Of-Age barometer to see if the time was right for such a display (sexy enough to titillate the kids, while toned-down enough to bypass conservative, middle-America parental units), tabulated the results to arrive at yes, stuck a wind-up key in Britneys back, turned it clockwise a few turns, and pushed her out on stage to seal the deal.</em> [via <a href="http://whatdoiknow.org/archives/001139.shtml">What Do I Know</a>]</p>

            <p>We were just added to Mary Jo Foley’s list of <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,0,1234054,00.asp?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535">Microsoft webloggers</a>. I don’t know what I think of that. But I should prepare for lots of hate mail.</p>

            <p><a href="http://mywireservice.com">MyWireService</a> just got <a href="http://www.ctsdownloads.com/blog/2003_08_24_archive.html#106207144079114195">a great review</a>:</p>

<p><em>Awesome user interface, easy to get started without instructions, and clever “add ons”. This is without a doubt the ultimate RSS feed tool for newbie’s. It gives me great pleasure to give this service a 5 out 5 rating. They will be charging $9.99/year after the beta period ends and normally I would dock them a point for that. To be fair though, I can not ignore the tremendous job that they have done to create a really great service. With this in mind I will cut them a break and stick with my 5 out 5 rating. After all people, bandwith is expensive and they are asking for less than a buck per month!</em></p>

<p>It’s nice when people recognize your hard work. And I like that he explicitly recommended it for newbies, which is our target market!</p>
