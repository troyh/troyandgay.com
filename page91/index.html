              <p>Forbes has <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2010/06/04/migration-moving-wealthy-interactive-counties-map.html">an interactive map</a> showing where people are moving to and from in the US. People are fleeing from Detroit and Los Angeles and people are flocking to Seattle (black represents number of people moving in and red represents moving out):</p>

<p>I’m not surprised, Seattle is a great place to live: temperate weather, good jobs, beautiful scenery, protected environment, great outdoor activities, progressive government. Kiplinger <a href="http://www.kiplinger.com/magazine/archives/10-best-cities-2010-for-the-next-decade.html">recently rated Seattle #2</a> in their list of top cities for the next decade. It’s good for Seattle – more people = bigger market = better services – but I don’t like the idea of Seattle becoming crowded. I moved away from the east coast (partly) because of all the people!</p>

              <p>We made our initial offer on May 6th and here we are, 40 days later, and we have an agreed-upon contract to buy the house. We walked away from the deal once and were inches from doing it a second time, but we slept on it and decided to agree to the last counter-offer.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>We plan to stay in the house for 20 years until the kids go off to college. Our agent, who has heard buyers’ plans many times in his 21-year career, tells us that when people say 20 years, they mean 10, and when they say 10, they mean 5. We can’t know how we’ll feel in the future, of course, but we’ve been in our current house for almost 9 years and would be staying here if it weren’t for the kids. Barring catastrophes, 10 years seems easy. If we can make it that long, inertia should carry us for 10 more.</p>

<p>All told, it took us over 2 years to find a house we liked, interrupted by 7-months of work to design an entirely new house. It feels good to finally stop talking about it and start doing it! The rest should be smoother since our job is generally done now; other people do the rest of the work: appraisal for the lender, financing paperwork, etc.</p>

<p>We should close on July 15th. It’ll take another 9+ months to renovate it, so we won’t be living there until Spring 2011. I’m looking forward to start of the construction!</p>

              <p>This is one my favorite sites: <a href="http://shitmykidsruined.tumblr.com/">Shit My Kids Ruined</a>. I can relate. But I have to give my kids some credit. A few months ago our digital camera suddenly stopped working with the infamous “<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=canon+powershot+sd750+lens+error+restart+camera&amp;revid=1403638925&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g1IWTOeFLdfjnQfK8ZmPDA&amp;ved=0CFsQ1QIoAA">Lens Error. Restart camera.</a>” message – the lens gets stuck and won’t retract. We tried <a href="http://camerarepair.blogspot.com/2007/12/fixing-lens-error-on-digital-camera.html">the best instructions we could find</a> but couldn’t fix it. It was out of the warranty period so I bought a replacement camera for Mother’s Day and we let the kids have the broken one to play with – they love playing with things that have buttons. A couple days later I found it on the living room floor with the lens retracted. How’d they do that? No amount of pushing on it could get it to go back in for me. I decided to put the battery back in and see if it was fixed and it worked! <em>How’d they do that??!</em> Now we have two functioning cameras. Thanks kids!</p>

              <p>We delivered our list of inspection items to the seller of the house this evening. Technically, our agent delivered it to their agent. While the list is shorter than we thought it’d be, there’s some things that add up to real dollars: new boiler, leaking pipes, removal of asbestos wrap on the heating pipes, galvanized pipe (blech!) replacement, garage roof leaks, some electrical repair, and minor repairs to the window sills, etc.</p>

<p>My guess is that they are going to refuse to budge and argue that none of this stuff needs to be done. The owner of the house passed away in 2008 and her 9 (!) children are all involved in the negotiations, which makes it more difficult for them to come to a consensus. They all grew up in the house, I think, so it’s not surprising that they wouldn’t see the problems with the house.</p>

<p>We should know in a few days whether we will be looking for another house.</p>
