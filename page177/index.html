            <p>We’ve watched a lot of movies lately, but unless they’re “so bad they annoy me”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/29/i-wish-there-was-no-country-for-bad-movie-makers/, I haven’t reviewed them. Catching up a little…</p>

<!-- more -->

<p><em>There Will Be Blood</em>: Very good movie and story. Daniel Day-Lewis is a great actor and very deserving of his Oscar win. Except for a couple splashes of oil on the camera lens, it was very well-made too.</p>

<p><em>Juno</em>: it started really annoyingly with the dialogue clearly intending to create as many catch-phrases as possible, but thankfully that stopped and the movie improved. It wasn’t funny, although it tried to be, but it wasn’t your typical afternoon special movie either. Ellen Page was acceptable, but didn’t deserve the Oscar nomination.</p>

<p><em>Death at a Funeral</em>: I like British humor, but not the unfunny kind. This should have been a 10-minute short.</p>

<p><em>In The Valley of Elah</em>: Probably would have been better if not a true story, it just wasn’t interesting enough. But good acting.</p>

<p><em>Bee Movie</em>: Pixar clearly did not make this movie. Dumb story – bees sue humans for selling honey and not paying the bees – and just filled with stupid bee puns.</p>

<p><em>Dan In Real Life</em>: Entertaining, but the family was so “perfect” it was implausible – what family puts on a talent show complete with costumes to entertain themselves? Only one that has Dane Cook in it, I’m sure.</p>

<p><em>Things We Lost In The Fire</em>: The screenplay should have been lost in a fire.</p>

<p><em>I Am Legend</em>: I like Will Smith and this was as entertaining as anything he’s done. Mostly just a zombie movie, though.</p>

<p><em>Michael Clayton</em>: This movie should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Tom Wilkinson was far better as a crazy guy than Javier Bardem in that lousy movie that actually did win Best Picture. The story was interesting and the pacing and timeline always kept me interested.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>The Onion’s “man-on-the-street interviews”:http://www.theonion.com/content/amvo/poll_mccain_getting_even?utm_source=onion_rss_daily about McCain running close to Democrats in national polls:</p>

<p>bq. “The American people are getting harder and harder to predict when they start wanting a white man for president.”</p>

<p>Interestingly, McCain “technically isn’t a natural-born citizen”:http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23415028/, which is a requirement set in the Constitution to be President. He was born on a US military base in Panama. Congress has “a resolution up this week”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/18/us/politics/18web-hulse.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin to special-case McCain to officially consider him a natural-born citizen. Of course he’s a citizen and should be eligible to be President, but I find it interesting how “strict Constitutionalists” (read: right-wing Republicans) seem to pick and choose what the Constitution says and what it doesn’t say, similar to the way the interpret the Bible to say what they want it to say.</p>

<p>I’d be willing to bet that if Hillary or Barack were in a similar situation that the Republicans in Congress wouldn’t be questioning their eligibility – they’d certainly question their patriotism. McCain could be a “Manchurian Candidate”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manchurian_Candidate. After spending so many years in a Vietnam prison camp, we can’t be sure that he wasn’t brainwashed by the communists, can we?</p>

            <p>A friend of mine, “Adam Blum”:http://www.adamblum.com/, ran the “Boston Marathon”:http://www.bostonmarathon.org/Default.asp today in 3 hours 39 minutes, finishing 9,176 out of over 25,000 runners. Impressive! Congratulations, Adam!</p>

<p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/blog/pix/2008/04/adambostonmarathon.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I met Adam at my first job out of college in Bethesda, Maryland in 1991. He later left and went to a consultancy in Rosslyn, Virginia and eventually hired me. Years later, I went to Microsoft and moved to Seattle and soon after that, he also moved to Seattle to work for Microsoft. He’s gone on to several startups in Silicon Valley and we’ve only kept in touch loosely. He’s one of the smartest people I’ve ever worked with but in spite of that, he somehow really got into triathlons and now ultra-marathons. He does a marathon every weekend and “blogs about it”:http://coursetrained.blogspot.com/.</p>

            <p>She took “her first couple steps”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/29/first-steps/ a little over two weeks ago but today she learned she can do it on her own. Here’s a video of her this afternoon, but even that’s nothing, she was walking 20 feet and around corners this evening.</p>
