<p>“Roethlisberger signed a $102 million 8-year contract”:http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08063/862127-66.stm?cmpid=steelers.xml. He’s the highest-paid Steeler ever and possibly the highest-paid player in the NFL. That’s justified… he’s been one of the top 3 QBs in all of his only 4 years in the NFL, including a Super Bowl win. I hope the Steelers can improve their offensive line this year to protect Roethlisberger better than they have the last couple years. But they made it harder by letting Alan Faneca go. “He signed with the New York Jets”:http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08062/861895-66.stm?cmpid=steelers.xml becoming the highest-paid offensive lineman in NFL history with a $40 million 5-year contract.</p>

          <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/blog/pix/2008/03/seattle.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Today is the 11-year anniversary of my first day at Microsoft. I remember this because of the date: 3/3. How did I end up here? I had always wanted to move to San Francisco since visiting the area several times on business. My employer, a software consulting company, was trying to open an office in San Jose and they were going to have me open the office. They dragged their feet for almost a year and by that time, Microsoft offered me a job so I took it so I could at least get to the west coast. I figured getting to the west coast and having it completely paid-for by Microsoft would make it easier to eventually move to San Francisco.</p>

<p>My plan was to work at Microsoft for several years, say 5 or so, and then start my own software company in San Francisco. I met Gay, we started dating in 1998, I quit Microsoft in 1999 and somehow convinced Gay to start a software business with me. I’m still here in Seattle even though I told myself I’d never want to live in rainy Seattle for long. It turns out that I love Seattle, including the rain.</p>

          <p>Raul Castro, the new President, has “already signed two human rights treaties”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/01/world/americas/01cuba.html?ex=1362027600&amp;en=ca823ad5997eb8aa&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss:</p>

<p>bq. One of the pacts, the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, guarantees “civil and political freedom,” including the right to self-determination, peaceful assembly, freedom of religion, privacy, <em>freedom to leave a country</em>, and equal protection before the law.</p>

<p>Does that mean that Cubans can leave Cuba?</p>

        <article>
          <p>Our neighbors <em>finally</em> sold their house and moved. Price: $150,000. The new owners are cleaning it up so we got the chance to go inside and check it out. Bear in mind that the house has been cleaned up by the new owners.</p>

<p>We affectionately refer to them as “The Pigs” because they used to own two pot-bellied pigs that roamed the property and we never knew their last name.</p>

<p>h1. History (as we heard it)</p>

<p>When we met the father, Ed, we were walking our dogs and he called us over to introduce himself. A couple minutes into the conversation he announced that he doesn’t molest his children. He explained that no matter what we heard (we hadn’t heard anything… yet) and no matter what the court documents said, he did not molest his daughter. He explained that the neighbors are all out to get him and make him look bad.</p>

<p>The mother grew up in the house, so she’s lived there for 40+ years! She was given the house by her father who -lives in California now- +still lives on Vashon+. We later heard that their oldest daughter was taken away from them because he had molested her. She lives in Seattle or California and has never returned to the house.</p>

<p>Their 22-year old son lived there off and on and did petty crimes in the neighborhood; he stole our mail twice once getting a DVD (sorry Netflix!) and he broke into another neighbor’s classic Mercedes to get spare change and ferry tickets. We filed a police report and the first thing the officer said was “Jonathan’s back in town.” We’d see him in downtown Vashon on occassion hanging out in the park. He mostly seemed to live in a van parked on the property.</p>

<p>The parents divorced and she started dating some new guy, who started out looking okay but he devolved into a crystal-meth smoker. Gay once ran into him at the grocery store buying a single beer with change. Everyone knows classy people buy lots of beer with a credit card. :)</p>

<p>Other neighbors, Bill and Milly, a sweet older couple who have lived here for 30 years, have a long history with them and lots of police involvement. Ed explained to us that Bill was the biggest drug-dealer in Washington State and also a pimp running a large prostitution ring that included Ed’s own wife against her will. Crystal meth apparently makes you a paranoid delusional.</p>

<p>The saddest thing (besides the alleged child molestation) was the two youngest kids, Amanda (12?) and “Li’l Joe” (7?), lived in this house and rarely went to school. Amanda was like the pretty girl in The Munsters and very polite. Li’l Joe seemed to have a learning disability. Both stopped going to school and we’d see Li’l Joe playing barefoot in the mud in the front yard in the winters.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago we heard that they had sold the place but didn’t believe it. Then I ran into the guy who bought it. He buys property, fixes it up and flips them. We’ll see how much he puts into this place.</p>

<p>h1. Photos</p>

<p>You can only imagine the smell of this place. Be thankful that there’s no smell-o-vision. And this is very cleaned up, the yard used to be full of cars, broken appliances, furniture and tons of trash.</p>
