              <p><a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/MT/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=1933">My friend Isabel chastised me for not mentioning 3/11, the Madrid bombings.</a>  She is right, of course. It has only been a few weeks and it seems the continued success of al Qaeda in Madrid has been lost already in this country as Condolezza Rice only finally appears before our 9/11 commission today.
Undoubtedly, the Madrid bombing affected the outcome of the Spanish election, but not in the way it was framed immediately afterwards. From what I have read, Aznar’s government wasn’t popular, not just for its Iraq stance, but his botched handling of the bombing (blaming the Basques) did not help – reminds me all to well of our own President’s continued insistence of whether Iraq had anything to do with 9/11…“See if Saddam did this. See if he’s linked in any way.”
I’ve read estimates that say the 3/11 operation was financed on $1,000.  It has become very cheap to kill people.  I feel it in my heart that Britain will be next.  This is a misunderstood war, and the Iraq war has handed our enemy precisely the propaganda they need.</p>

              <p>For no apparent reason, I stopped blogging.  It was a slow decline I guess, and then when I noticed it had been so long, I decided to make it an even month without a post.
Actually, it wasn’t much of a vacation.  Frankly, I’ve been so dang busy there hasn’t been much time to post.  Between going from a 3 person company back to a 2 person company, and trying to hire another 3rd person, I’ve had a tremendous amount of work.  Kathy’s training officially ended today, so she is on the job and I’m breathing again.  Let’s just hope that means I’ll think of something worth blogging too…</p>

              <p>An interesting <a href="http://news.com.com/2010-7352_3-5185413.html?part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=news">article</a> about the importance of IP (Internet Protocol, not Intellectual Property). The world will indeed be great as long as competition exists. Unfortunately, over the last few years, the US Govt has consistently sided with big corps over small corps and the FCC seems to be willing to let any two large corps merge into a mammoth corp. If the government doesn’t figure this out and quick, we’ll be paying exorbitant rates  to monolithic corporations and it’ll take several decades to correct itself.

              <p>A couple weeks ago, we got a call from a friend asking us to volunteer to help out for a big festival/auction at the end of summer that he was organizing. Wanting to do something for the community and to help out our friend who was very busy, we agree. A few days later, he quits! Apparently, he was not happy with the direction it was going. <em>He was the leader!</em> If something’s going in the wrong direction, who but the leader is to blame? Yet he blamed everyone else. And how’d he quit? Warn anyone? Nope. He sends a resignation letter out of the blue. Then just days after that, he sends another one. Seriously. Two resignation letters for the same job. “I quit!” and “I doubly quit!”.</p>

<p>So here we are, two people who spend easily 80+ hours a week each (not counting the time we spend midnight to 7am dreaming about work) working on our own business and we volunteer to add another responsibility to our lives to help out a friend in need. We’re also in the process of planning our wedding that we’re having just 2 weeks before this event.</p>

<p>Now, we (and the others involved) have even more work to do because he left the project in shambles and we have to pick up the pieces. Are you ever surprised when your elders behave like children? Age and maturity have nothing to do with each other. And selfish people suck.</p>

              <p>Kurt Cobain committed suicide 10 years ago today. I remember talking about it at lunch with an older coworker and he said “Who was he and why does anyone care?”. I also still remember the day I bought <em>Nevermind</em> a few years earlier. And I remember my mom looking at my Nevermind t-shirt (that I still have) and saying “<a href="http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/B000003TA4.08.LZZZZZZZ.jpg">What a dumb picture</a>”.</p>

<p>Listening to NPR, which is doing a show on Kurt Cobain, people call in telling how Kurt Cobain affected their lives. While a lot of people criticize him for suicide, there’s a lot of people whose lives he saved through his music. As a former teenager myself, I can still understand what it’s like to be angry and depressed about life and the world and how music can be the outlet for it. I hope I don’t lose that understanding as I get older and have teenage kids of my own.</p>
