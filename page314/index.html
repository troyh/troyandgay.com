          <p><a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2001789135_microsoft120.html">Ballmer gets testy</a> with an individual shareholder at their annual shareholders meeting. The shareholder criticized them for hoarding $51 billion in cash and not paying out larger dividends. Ballmer claims they’re holding the money to support them in the event that the courts force them to change their business model. That’s like a bank robber arguing he needs to keep his loot to hire lawyers because the courts may try to take it away. Here’s an idea for Microsoft: stop breaking the law and you won’t have to worry about the courts. Here’s an idea to the US Government: start enforcing the laws to distribute the ill-gotten gains one company holds to the rest of the industry to create more jobs and improve the economy.</p>

          <p>T-Online, the online arm of Deutsche-Telekom, the German phone company, may <a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/artikel/455/21434/">buy AOL</a>? (<a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/urltrurl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sueddeutsche.de%2Fwirtschaft%2Fartikel%2F455%2F21434%2F&amp;lp=de_en&amp;tt=url">Translation</a>). T-Online has half the subscribers as AOL, but is the #2 online service worldwide. Certainly they’d only buy them for the number of subscribers. So maybe this means the <a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid14_gci554703,00.html">“walled garden”</a> that AOL users find themselves in would disappear? That’d be good for the internet.</p>

          <p>I just upgraded to a new version of a great little app that sits in my menu bar and tells me the current weather and the forecast called <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/heat-meteo">Meteorologist</a>. While checking out the new features, I find this in the About screen:</p>

<p>This is the final release of Meteorologist from Humongous Elephants and Tigers.  I worked on Meteo for quite some time while I attending the University of Illinois, but I am sad to announce that no future development will be done on my part (although many could have guessed that this was coming).</p>

<p>To those who hate my guts - you probably have good reason, and I hope your hatred is doused a little with pity.  I have been woefully behind on emails and updates.  I have plenty of excuses, but that doesn’t really matter.</p>

<p>Meteorologist is now officially out of my hands.  I will be hunting around to find someone to take up the torch, and to try to take up the good fight.</p>

<p>Best of luck to everyone,
Matthew Fahrenbacher</p>

<p>The author gets hate e-mail from people about it so he’s quitting development of it. It’s completely free software! The author does nothing but a positive thing and he gets hate mail about it! Never underestimate how mean people can be to other people.</p>
