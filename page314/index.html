            <p><a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/">74,000 recipes!</a>. Funny…. AllRecipes <em>finally</em> announced how many recipes they have. For over 4 years they said “Over 20,000 recipes” and I always thought at any time they’d say “Over 30,000 recipes”. But time came and went. Today, they finally announced a whopping 22,000 recipes. In the last year, we added 40,000 recipes. It took them 4 years to add 2,000. Sure, they’d probably argue quality over quantity (as if they’re the arbiters of quality)… yeah… and the internet would be better if there were a small number of “quality” web sites as opposed to the diverse huge set of web sites.</p>

<p>And I’ll refrain from talking about their confusing redesign and just note that there are fewer molecules in the universe than there are words on their home page (although the print is about as tiny as a molecule). And I think they could have probably squeezed one more ad in there somewhere. ;-)</p>

<p>But at least their employees have stopped calling us looking for a job. So they must be doing something right these days.</p>

            <p>I suppose I shouldn’t have been, but I was astounded at the Congressional reaction to the Massachusetts Supreme Court decision on the legality of gay marriage.  I do believe it will be impossible to get a Constitutional amendment to support the idea that marriage must be between a man and a woman, but I can’t believe they are even suggesting it.  I can’t stand the way they way the conservatives keep saying we need to “do this for the children” when I don’t know a single gay divorced family…  I especially like the way Hit &amp; Run, the Reason magazine weblog, describes it as causing “<a href="http://www.reason.com/hitandrun/003485.shtml">the equivalent of a divide-by-zero error in the circuitry of conservative brains, which are short circuiting en masse</a>.”</p>

<p>I really just don’t get what the problem is…marriage is sacrosanct to everyone that does it right?  Shouldn’t they be glad that the “prurient” gay heathens will now be monogamous?</p>

            <p>I thought the recent update to Panther solved my Bluetooth iSync problem (kernel panic!), but I just sync’d and <em>boom!</em>, another kernel panic. I hope the <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,4248,1387600,00.asp">forthcoming 10.3.2</a> fixes this once and for all!</p>

<p>Speaking of the Mac, <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.12/billjoy.html?tw=wn_tophead_3">Bill Joy loves his G5</a>. It’s surprising to see a very wealthy person who cares about the problems the world faces and even more surprising that he’s talking about it.</p>

            <p>Apple announced a <a href="">20” iMac</a> and a <a href="http://www.apple.com/powermac/">faster G5 PowerMac</a>. I didn’t see a single rumor about the 20” iMac, which is rare. In other Apple news, <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/11/18/1422255">apparently</a> Apple is the one who forced their employee to stop distributing <a href="http://www.cricketmedia.com/software/netflix/">Netflix Fanatic</a> and is rumored to be integrating it into <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/sherlock/">Sherlock</a>.</p>
