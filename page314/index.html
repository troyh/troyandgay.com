              <p>Some good internet news… <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/19/technology/19popup.html">pop-ups may soon disappear</a>; <a href="http://recipezaar.com">we</a>‘ve given up lots of revenue by refusing pop-ups because we hate them so much, so I’m hopeful that we may be able to stop feeling like suckers (pop-up ads pay 10 to 35 times more than regular ads). And better still, [Yahoo has confirmed it will replace Google with its own search engine. Google’s good, but it’s got <em>way</em> too much power – it’ll be nice to have competition again.</p>
