          <p>On this day last year, we <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2002/11/001080.php">hit 43,000</a> recipes. We’ve added 30,000 recipes in just the last year!</p>

<p>Today, I retired the first PC I ever bought as a professional developer in 1993. It was originally a $2000 Gateway 66MHz 486 with 16 MBs RAM. A few years later I upgraded it to a 80MHz Pentium (remember those <a href="http://www.intel.com/support/processors/overdrive/pentium/20284.htm">Overdrive</a> upgrades?) and a whopping 40MB RAM. That machine ran NT4 for years til 1999 when, unable to run Windows 2000, I put Linux on it as a lark just to see what Linux was like. I couldn’t believe how fast that slow machine got! So I decided to make it our mail server, discovered not only was Linux fast, it was the most reliable OS I’d  ever used. That was the turning point for us and Linux – today we have 15 servers running Linux.</p>

<p>The machine is still running fine and I’ve never had to replace any broken parts. The power supply fan was getting a little loud and I replaced the hard drive with a larger one. But other than that, it’s held up for over 10 years running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It’ll still be used for the odd test case, though. I just hate to throw a functioning computer away.</p>

          <p><a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2001789135_microsoft120.html">Ballmer gets testy</a> with an individual shareholder at their annual shareholders meeting. The shareholder criticized them for hoarding $51 billion in cash and not paying out larger dividends. Ballmer claims they’re holding the money to support them in the event that the courts force them to change their business model. That’s like a bank robber arguing he needs to keep his loot to hire lawyers because the courts may try to take it away. Here’s an idea for Microsoft: stop breaking the law and you won’t have to worry about the courts. Here’s an idea to the US Government: start enforcing the laws to distribute the ill-gotten gains one company holds to the rest of the industry to create more jobs and improve the economy.</p>

          <p>T-Online, the online arm of Deutsche-Telekom, the German phone company, may <a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/artikel/455/21434/">buy AOL</a>? (<a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/urltrurl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sueddeutsche.de%2Fwirtschaft%2Fartikel%2F455%2F21434%2F&amp;lp=de_en&amp;tt=url">Translation</a>). T-Online has half the subscribers as AOL, but is the #2 online service worldwide. Certainly they’d only buy them for the number of subscribers. So maybe this means the <a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid14_gci554703,00.html">“walled garden”</a> that AOL users find themselves in would disappear? That’d be good for the internet.</p>

          <p>I just upgraded to a new version of a great little app that sits in my menu bar and tells me the current weather and the forecast called <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/heat-meteo">Meteorologist</a>. While checking out the new features, I find this in the About screen:</p>

<p>This is the final release of Meteorologist from Humongous Elephants and Tigers.  I worked on Meteo for quite some time while I attending the University of Illinois, but I am sad to announce that no future development will be done on my part (although many could have guessed that this was coming).</p>

<p>To those who hate my guts - you probably have good reason, and I hope your hatred is doused a little with pity.  I have been woefully behind on emails and updates.  I have plenty of excuses, but that doesn’t really matter.</p>

<p>Meteorologist is now officially out of my hands.  I will be hunting around to find someone to take up the torch, and to try to take up the good fight.</p>

<p>Best of luck to everyone,
Matthew Fahrenbacher</p>

<p>The author gets hate e-mail from people about it so he’s quitting development of it. It’s completely free software! The author does nothing but a positive thing and he gets hate mail about it! Never underestimate how mean people can be to other people.</p>
