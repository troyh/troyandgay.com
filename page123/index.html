          </h3>
            <p>I’m building an iPhone app and wanted to put it on my iPhone to try it out on real hardware. I discovered that I can’t do this without getting a license from Apple which requires that you log into your Developer account at Apple.com, which I found shocking. You then have to fill out a form and promise to pay $99. Okay, not a big deal and $99 isn’t much. But then you have to be approved for the program. I assume that means they reject people. <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2008/03/14/iphone-developer-rejection-letter-mass-mailing/">They reject people</a> from building apps for their platform?! I’ve never heard of such a thing!</p>

<p>I can understand their approval process for selling your app on their App Store, but they won’t even let me make a crappy app and put it on my own iPhone. And you can’t just pay the $99 and get your license immediately. Again, this doesn’t mean they have to accept my app on their store and potentially ruin other people’s iPhones, this is just so I can put my app <em>on my own</em> iPhone!</p>

<p>It gets worse….</p>

<p>Then 24 hours later, I got this email from Apple:</p>

<p>What?! They really do look over my application and need to verify that I have a real company. Why? Again, this is just so I can try my own app out on my own phone.  Moreover, I’m planning to give this app away for free. Why do I have to have a corporation to do that? What good is this doing Apple? Who are they protecting themselves from?</p>

<p>What do they think I’m going to do? Build an app and to distribute it outside of the App Store, invite people over to my house so they can put their phone in my cradle and sync the app to it? Or I’d post my license key on a web site along with my source code so that people could download XCode and my source and then build and sync the app to their iPhone? And I’d do this to avoid paying Apple $0 for the App Store fee on my free app?</p>

<p>It’s even more crazy given that I can build a Mac OS X app and distribute it myself without Apple’s consent and I can charge $1000 for it if I want and Apple gets none of that money. But giving away a free app, or even selling it for $1 on the App Store, and Apple needs a thorough vetting process?!?</p>

<p>To make it even dumber, they require a fax. A fax! In 2009! Apple Computer requires a faxed document in 2009. The Washington State government deals in electronic documents and our lawyers deal in electronic documents. State government and lawyers have embraced PDFs but Apple, one of the biggest supporters of PDFs, isn’t quite sure about email and PDFs so they need a 1970s technology to deliver documents. Unbelievable. Now I’ve gotta go figure out how to fax my documentation to Apple rather than just email the PDFs to them.</p>

<p>Even after I do all this, I still have to wait. I have to wait to be given the chance to pay my $99 and then, apparently, I have to wait for them to issue me a license that I can use to transfer my app to my iPhone. <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=8658270">According to some</a>, this can take weeks and even months!</p>

<p>Whomever is in charge of the iPhone Developer Program at Apple should be fired.</p>

<p>Update: I figured there has to be a way to email the documentation to them so I called Apple to ask. Nope. Fax is the only way they will accept documents. I asked if I could FedEx the documentation to them and the person I talked to said no, only fax is acceptable. I asked why and they said that it’s because of “legal reasons”. In other words, a dumbass lawyer at Apple who doesn’t know what a PDF is and hasn’t used email in their life said fax is the only acceptable format (to their credit, Apple probably ditched telegrams a few years ago) and nobody at Apple questioned it. I imagine that lawyer then put his spectacles in his pocket and his fedora on his head, put the dust cover back on his typewriter, grabbed his briefcase, hopped into his Model T and drove home.</p>

<p>Update #2: The iPhone Developer Program customer service I talked to earlier called me back. Gotta give them credit for that. And they said that there is a postal address that I can send my documentation to. That makes sense, but I still don’t understand why a fax is preferable to email. Faxes are very low quality copies of a document, a PDF or even a scanned document is a much higher-quality version and even more difficult to fake. Apple seems to think that getting into the iPhone Developer Program is such a sacred thing that they need a big vetting process and be legally protected. It’s paranoid and downright stupid thinking on Apple’s part. They really look like idiots throughout the iPhone Developer Program.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>After Obama’s proposal to raise taxes on people making more than $250K I heard a lot of supposedly intelligent people, generally Republicans, calling it a disincentive to make more money and anti-American Dream. These people seemed to believe, or were at least trying to persuade people to believe, that your highest tax bracket applies to <em>all</em> your income. In other words, they’d have you believe that if you’re in the 39% tax bracket, all your income is taxed at 39% rather than just the dollars within that tax bracket.</p>

<p>Media Matters “exposed ABC News”:http://mediamatters.org/countyfair/200903030013?show=1 for publishing an article written by the brainless Emily Friedman implying that it is true, complete with an attorney and a dentist explaining that they are trying to figure out how to reduce their income to $249,999 so they pay less in taxes! And that’s an attorney and a dentist, supposedly educated people. I’d bet that 90% of the country does not understand our tax system. The NY Times economics blog, Economix, noticed ABC News’ idiocy too and “explained how taxes work”:http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/tax-fallacies-explaining-marginal-tax-rates/.</p>

<p>In case you don’t know, if you make more money, you have more money than people who make less even if your tax bracket is higher. Any time you hear someone whining that they pay a lot in taxes, remind them that they paid a lot in taxes because they made a lot of money! There’s no need to feel sorry for rich people… if they don’t like earning lots of money and paying taxes on their earnings, they have an easy way to solve their “problem”: give money away until they’re not rich and they’re paying lower taxes.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Today is my 12th anniversary of living in Seattle, and one year exactly since my “11th-year anniversary”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/03/11-years-in-seattle/. 12 years is a long enough time to live in one place so I’ve been thinking about finding a new place to live to see what that’s like. Because I’ve been thinking about it and talking about it, Gay’s been thinking about it too. For some reason I have yet to figure out, she wants to continue to live with me.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The East Coast is out because I lived there for far too long (26 years) and it’s a god-awful place: year-round lousy weather and too crowded. The Midwest is less crowded, but for a good reason. The Southwest is too dry and hot. Alaska and Hawaii are too remote.</p>

<p>That leaves the West Coast. Northern California would be great but it’s too expensive in the San Francisco area and you can’t get lots of acreage anywhere around there for less than many millions, so I’d have to live north of San Francisco. Unfortunately, there’s no desirable place to live north of Napa Valley, which is still very expensive (and lacks nice views, IMO). Oregon would be great, especially the Portland area. It’s a beer, wine and coffee town, it’s less expensive than Seattle and you can get sizable land for reasonable prices but still be fairly close to Portland.</p>

<p>But then I remember where I live. We have 4 acres with a view you can’t get in many places around the world, let alone the US. Seattle’s a great city and, while the ferries are annoying, it’s relatively easy to get into the city. And we can remodel this house to fix its problems for much much cheaper than it would be to buy a house anywhere (which would also require a remodel).</p>

<p>But then again, I haven’t seriously considered any other countries. It’d be great to give the kids an experience of living in another country. Although they wouldn’t fully appreciate it until they’re 10 years old or so.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We were talking to a guy about his web site and he claimed it was worth millions of dollars. Since his site has zero profits on very little revenue and low traffic (and is declining in traffic), we thought it was a joke. But he proudly showed us a “YouNoodle”:http://younoodle.com/ valuation certificate. They really give a printable certificate complete with a gold seal, suitable for framing, I suppose.</p>

<p>Sure enough, YouNoodle says his site is worth millions. I’d never heard of YouNoodle (for good reason, I guess). It’s a site for early stage startups to get in contact with investors and people who can help the startup. They ask you a few questions about your startup, presumably so that would-be investors can take a look at your startup to see if they’re interested. But they go a step further (too far) and determine your valuation, a real dollar value, in 3 years.</p>

<p>As if the concept for determining future value wasn’t ridiculous enough, the questions they ask are “How do the founders know each other?” and “How much money do you expect to make in the future?”. Those are good questions for potential investors to ask, but you’d have to have absolutely no understanding of business or economics or reality, for that matter, to conclude that those questions actually determine  value.</p>

<p>Incidentally, YouNoodle values this blog, which makes no money at all, at $7 million! Is it 1999 all over again?!?</p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/picture-1112.png"><img src="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/picture-1112.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Note the fine print:</p>

<p>bq. YouNoodle’s model is based on rigorous quantitative analysis of historical data and the application of the latest relevant theory.</p>

<p>“Rigorous quantitative analysis” means they asked a few questions and did no analysis at all and “the application of the latest relevant theory” means they used whatever theory they like best at the moment.</p>

<p>And note the even finer print:</p>

<p>bq. You should not rely on Startup Predictor for any financial decision and should always seek
the assistance of a professional for any tax, legal, accounting or investment advice.</p>

<p>In other words, this number is completely fictitious so don’t blame us if you’re stupid enough to believe it and make financial decisions based on it.</p>

<p>The value of a business (even internet businesses!) is determined by two things: profits (not revenue) and the growth of those profits projected into the future. Intangibles like “brand value”, patents, “eyeballs”, reputation, etc. either contribute to the profits today, which makes them valuable, or they don’t, which makes them worthless. Some simple math using those numbers, adding in any tangible assets, tells the owner of the business how much the business is worth to them, i.e., if they had the same amount of money today versus owning the business and earning profits in the future, they’d come out even. A dollar more today and they’re better-off with the cash now; a dollar less and they’re better-off with the business over the years. The projections of future profits and growth rates are guesses, but they should at least be based on realistic numbers.</p>

<p>Of course, the price of everything in a free market is determined by what a buyer is willing to pay. How does a buyer come up with a value? They do the same math assuming they owned the business and were earning the profits over the years. If the buyer’s value is higher (they believe they can do better than the current owner) than the seller’s value, they both should be happy and the buyer should buy it and the seller should sell it. If the buyer’s value is lower than the seller’s value, the buyer should not buy it and the seller should not sell it. That’s how businesses are bought and sold, at least by intelligent and rational people.</p>

<p>While on the topic, the value of a business has absolutely nothing to do with the cost it took to build it. As an example, I was talking to another guy about buying an iPhone app that he made which was an electronic version of the Washington State Ferry schedules. He was selling it but I figured he wasn’t making any money on it because the price was outrageous. His insistence on selling it was depriving everyone of a useful iPhone app for no good reason. My intention was to buy it and give it away for free, so I wasn’t going to pay much for it. After days of beating around the bush about price he claimed that he spent $130,000 building the app (yeah, sure he did) and he needs at least that much back to sell it. That was the end of our conversation. By his logic, I could spend $1 million building a lemonade stand and expect to be paid at least $1 million for my business without selling a single glass of lemonade, as if there were no such thing as “wasted effort”. Fortunately, this story had a happy ending: he decided to stop charging for the app and give it away for free. :)</p>
