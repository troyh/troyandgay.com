          <p>The other beer I had this weekend was Deschutes’ Hop Henge. I haven’t read anything about this beer yet, but it tastes like a Double IPA that was also dry-hopped. The aroma is wonderful and it’s got a nice bitter bite with a soft lingering bitter aftertaste. Another great great beer from Deschutes.</p>

          <p>I finally had my first World Wide Stout. This beer is unbelievable. The label reads “A very dark beer brewed with a ridiculous amount of barley”. It takes six months to age too. It’s an 18% ABV beer, which makes it 30% more alcohol than wine and even more potent than the 14% “Raison D’Extra”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/24/dogfish-head-raison-dextra/, but less than their “120 Minute IPA”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/06/08/dogfish-head-120-minute-ipa/. So one bottle is like drinking 3 glasses of wine. It’s almost irresponsible to call this a beer. Plus, it tastes more like a port than a beer. I shared it with Gay and we drank it out of wine glasses. It took me an hour to drink my half!</p>

<p>I haven’t had a beer like this since Sam Adams Triple Bock back in early 1990s. It’s a great beer for sipping, and I loved every sip of it.</p>

<p>I’m either in love with Dogfish Head or they put something else in the beer… last night I dreamt that I visited the Dogfish Head brewery.</p>

        <article>
          <p>For anyone Googling for a similar problem they’re having with DirecTV…</p>

<p>We have two DirecTV receivers and on one of them we were having a lot of pixelation, i.e., digital artifacts, on HD channels. It would get so bad it was unwatchable. This happened for months. I called DirecTV and they always shipped me a new receiver and it always solved the problem for a while. But the problem always returned eventually.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>It’s relatively easy to get a new receiver, DirecTV ships you a new one,  you replace your old with the new and put the old one in the same box and slap the FedEx sticker they provide on it and back it goes. But, to their credit, DirecTV wanted to get to the bottom of the problem so I was elevated to “Home Response Service” or somesuch name. This means I get better service, they come to your house quickly and the customer service repeatedly call you to make sure you’re happy.</p>

<p>Long story short, after an inability to solve the problem, the last DirecTV tech that came out decided to replace the “B-Band converters”:http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/global/contentPageNR.jsp?assetId=P4370042. Neither of us that it’d fix it but he had nothing else to try. It turns out that one of them rattled when you shook it, as if the electronics inside had become unglued. Since replacing them, the picture has been perfect!</p>

<p>The converters just hang off the back of the receiver in between it and the coax cable. My theory is that the electronics in the B-Band converter would sometimes sit right in the box and the picture would be okay, but if they were jiggled enough they’d get dislodged and the problem would come back. Usually when I replaced the receiver, the converter happened to sit right and eventually they’d get bumped and the problem would come back.</p>

<p>Fortunately, DirecTV’s newest HD DVR, the HR-23, has these converters built-in so this problem will disappear for DirecTV eventually. But those of us with the HR-22 or older receivers who have to use the extra converters will potentially have this problem.</p>

          <p>We ate well during the Super Bowl. Megan made 7-layer dip, a really good guacamole (nicely salty) and veggies and dip. Gay made “Primanti Bros”:http://www.primantibros.com/ sandwiches and cup cakes that we both decorated. Coincidentally, Megan had the same cupcake idea and she made similar cupcakes with the Steelers emblem on them.</p>

<p>The beers we had were “Full Sail Amber”:http://www.fullsailbrewing.com/amber.cfm that Jon &amp; Megan brought over and we had Sierra Nevadaa’s “Torpedo Extra IPA”:http://www.sierranevada.com/beers/torpedo.html (a double IPA which was new to me), Pike Pale (a low-alcohol beer well-suited for football games) and “Lagunitas IPA”:http://www.lagunitas.com/beers/ipa.html, but that was intended to be “Lagunitas Pils”:http://www.lagunitas.com/beers/pilsner.html. After the game we popped a bottle of “Schramsberg”:http://www.schramsberg.com/ champagne to toast the Steelers. Surprisingly, I was not hung-over in the morning. although that game was worth having a hang-over for.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>After playing the toughest schedule in the NFL and finishing 12-4 (the Cardinals had one of the easiest schedules and finished 9-7), the Steelers won Super Bowl XLIII, 27-23, and became the first team to win 6 Super Bowls (Note: they were also the first team to win 3 and 4 Super Bowls). I can’t believe it took 25 years to win their 5th and only 3 more years to win their 6th.</p>

<p><img src="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/2675536811.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Going into the game, I didn’t think much of the Cardinals. In fact, I was rooting for them in the NFC Championship against Philadelphia because I thought they’d be easy to beat in the Super Bowl. I figured the Steelers #1 defense would easily crush the Cardinals 2-player offense. Pundits theorized that ex-Steelers Offensive coaches Whisenhunt and Russ Grimm, who now coach the Cardinals, were a threat to the Steelers. But I didn’t think so because neither were very good for the Steelers – their offensive game and their offensive line sucked. I often wished the Steelers would fire Whisenhunt. Besides, the future Hall-of-Famer defensive coach Dick LeBeau knows as much about Whisenhunt’s offense as Whisenhunt knows about LeBeau’s defense. I thought the Steelers had the advantage on both sides of the ball and Cardinals would score a max of 10 points while the Steelers ran away with it. I was less worried about this Super Bowl than I was in the 2005 Super Bowl against the hapless Seahawks. <em>That’s</em> how confident I was!</p>

<p>But the Cardinals played well. I don’t understand why Pittsburgh couldn’t stop the same two plays over and over. The Cardinals offense amounts to either a quick slant pass or screen pass to Fitzgerald or Boldin. But they could complete those plays almost every time, one ended up being a 64-yard TD to put the Cardinals ahead late in the game. And, as they did all year, the Steelers offense had a poor running game and Roethlisberger was under pressure on almost every play  (which tends to work out well for him, ironically).</p>

<p>While the Steelers won with a last-minute drive and a last-second TD pass, the Steelers proved that defenses win Championships. The goal-line interception and 100-yard run by James Harrison was the most important play in the game.</p>

<p>Congratulations to the Steelers, to Santonio Holmes for the MVP, to James Harrison for one of the most memorable plays in Super Bowl history and to Mike Tomlin for being the youngest coach, at 36, to win a Super Bowl and only the second to win a Super Bowl within their first two years as coach.</p>
