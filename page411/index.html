I’d pretty much say that “and” is the best conjunction to ever come into my life – no I’d definitely say it – and the “.com” is the best extension too.  Thanks Troy, I love U…nix!</p>

              <p>The new caching mechanism has been running well for the last few days. Our main goal was to relieve the load on the database side, which we have definitely done. But of course, that load doesn’t magically go away so it was transferred to the web server side. That’s good as their are more web servers than database servers and the work that the web server has to do is much more straightforward than the database server’s work. But more optimization/improvements are going to be beneficial.</p>

              <p>After dinner, we came home and finished watching Harry Potter 2. As with the first movie, it was well-made, the cinematography and special effects were very good and was entertaining throughout the almost 2.5 hours. But again like the first movie, it’s definitely a kids’ movie. The characters are a little too shallow and the storyline is very simple with a happy ending. It’s a “thinking kids’ movie”, but a kids’ move nonetheless.</p>

              <p>We had <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=34221">dinner</a> with some Recipezaar members last night at The Ruins: GinnyP, MeanChef and Ginny’s husband, Michael, and another couple who were friends of Ginny &amp; Michael.</p>

<p>I believe this is the first time we’ve ever met Recipezaar members in person. Ginny &amp; Michael were nice enough to treat us all to dinner (which must have been very expensive!).</p>

              <p>Today is our 5th Anniversary together! On this day 5 years ago, we went on our first date (I think to a <a href="http://www.brainwashed.com/bedhead/">Bedhead</a> concert at <a href="http://thecrocodile.com/">The Crocodile</a> in Seattle). One-and-a-half years later we quit our jobs and started <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a>. What a quick and fun 5 years it’s been. :-)</p>
