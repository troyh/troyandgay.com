            <p>Another jump in Alexa. Up to <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details?url=recipezaar.com">9,150</a>. I hate to say it, but I enjoy that our biggest competitor, AllRecipes, is consistently falling in the same ranking. $20 million in debt and still losing $4 million/yr, AllRecipes should be humbled, but they are less than the nicest people in this biz and they’ve even tried to flex their muscle against us with copyright violation claims on recipes they stole from other people. I also think it’s funny that we’ve had more than one employee of theirs call us asking for a job. :-)</p>

            <p>After the longest outage in Recipezaar history (almost 4 hours), Gay &amp; I just got back from downtown Seattle after installing another new machine with a 120GB hard drive. This should be enough for the new caching system (for now). In case anyone doesn’t know, standing in a loud server room with the air conditioning blasting so much you get a headache from the cold, cramped between rack cases and no chair in sight is not a fun place to spend a few hours.</p>

<p>Since we had some time before the next ferry home, we stopped at a brewpub we discovered weeks ago in West Seattle. They have a really good Pale Ale that I really like and very good food for pub food. Beer is good. 5 minutes before the ferry left, we realized the time and bolted out the door and made the last few miles to the ferry dock in 4 minutes and was the last car on the ferry.</p>

            <p>Our new caching mechanism is great, but it requires a huge amount of disk space. We ran out of space in 12 hours after first installing it. And this was on a Sunday, which is a very slow day for the site. We made a quick-and-dirty change to pull disk space from another server. We’ll see how long that lasts. In the meantime, we’re working on getting more hard disk space. Good thing hard drives are cheap.</p>

            <p>To add to Gay’s analogy of running a 24/7 store, also imagine that you think your store is plenty big enough, your staff is sufficiently trained, the door is functioning at optimum performance in all your testing. You’ve planned and tested and  you’ve been building stores for your entire professional life. Then you put the “Open” sign up and within minutes your store is completely filled with people, all wanting different things at the same time, your staff is overworked and asking for higher pay and more benefits. Unfortunately, you’re not taking in any revenue from all these customers (you’re a store-builder, not a business(wo)man).</p>

<p>It can be extremely frustrating at times. Part of you wants to just shut it all down and give up. But the other part of you sees it as a challenge and you refuse to be beaten and you just know that if you work that much harder, you sacrifice yet another day/weekend/social event, you will win.</p>
