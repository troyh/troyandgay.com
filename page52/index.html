          <p>The second big doors were getting installed today and they were using a crane to do it, which I thought Hudson would love to see, so we got up early at 5:30a and packed everyone into the car and took the 7:55a ferry. Hudson woke up asking to see the crane lift the doors (“I want to see the big crane lift the doors”), so my talk about it last night worked.</p>

<p>We stopped at Top Pot for doughnuts on the way for everyone at the house, including 2 pink ones with sprinkles (the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Homer+Simpson+doughnut&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=ivnso&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OGbFTYOuBov2tgO79snDAQ&amp;ved=0CB0QsAQ&amp;biw=1132&amp;bih=1147">Homer Simpson doughnut</a>) for Havana and Hudson, of course. We got to the house at 8:30 and the north opening in the wall was already taken down. They told me it wasn’t as exciting as I imagined it’d be (they were right – I watched it on the security camera DVR). Havana and Hudson pretended to drive the crane truck while they prepared the opening for the door jamb. Mark gave me my very own (with my name on it) Shuchart/Dow hardhat too.</p>

<p>The crane moved very slowly so it wasn’t as exciting for Hudson after the first 10 minutes so he and Havana ran around the yard most of the time instead. By 10:30 the door jamb was in place and they started putting the doors on. That took an hour or so and they spent the rest of the day fastening the jamb in place, installing the lock hardware and boarding it up.</p>

<p>The doors look amazing, they did a nice job building them, which is a relief because it took us a while to pick the right builder from three possibilities. Schuchart/Dow helped us figure out what the differences between the builders would be so we knew what was worth paying for and what we didn’t care about, but you never know how they’ll turn out until you actually see them. They feel great to open and they don’t yet have the glass (“glazing” in industry-speak) in them, which will add quite a bit more weight to them, and should make them even smoother. I don’t think the kids will be opening them anytime soon.</p>

<p>They took up all the protective paper on the floors so the tile guys could grout the kitchen tile tomorrow, a Saturday, so we got to see the entire kitchen + family room floors together for the first time and can envision how it will look when it’s all done. The new doors let in a lot of light and make the floors look even better.</p>

<p>The tile in the master bathroom is mostly done, they were just finishing up the shower. We decided to use the same-sized tiles (2’ x 1’) in the shower as the rest of the bathroom as opposed to smaller 4”x4” versions because it will look better. The concern, though, is that the bigger tiles have fewer grout lines which, apparently, prevent the floor from being as slippery. The tiles are honed so they’re already less slippery, but when wet, you never know. I tested how slippery a small 4”x4” sample piece is that we had at home and the tile in our current shower tile is more slippery. We grabbed a big tile to bring home to test it for sure. But worst case, we can put a no-slip treatment on it if it’s too slippery.</p>

<p>The painting has started with priming the kids’ bedrooms and bathrooms and the master bath vanity cabinetry has arrived and should go in next week. The wood <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/04/22/lucky-wood/">we selected at Rhine</a> had arrived this week and the cabinet-makers have already picked up their part of it to build the basement cabinetry. 12th Ave Iron was there installing the butler’s pantry steel shelving. It looks great, but they couldn’t install it because they templated the space after the drywall was installed but before the mud was applied and the door trim was installed (Mark took responsibility, 12th Ave didn’t know), so it was off by 1/8” or so, which seems small to us, but they have to shave off the shelves a little to get them to fit. They’ve built new drawers for an existing closet in the dormer of our master bedroom and those are ready to be painted – the originals had no sliding hardware on them and didn’t quite fit anymore. The new electrical for <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/04/27/house-update/">the chandeliers</a> was completed this week too.</p>

<p>We talked with Mark about the landscaping plan and some concerns we have about it and then we left and went out to dinner at Elliot Bay. Hudson didn’t have a nap, but he was fine until we got in line for the ferry, when he started whining, which bothered Eva and made her cry, which Hudson thought was funny, so he kept making loud noises to scare her and kept her crying the whole way home. Kids are so delightful. By the time we got home and put them all to bed, Gay and I sat in a dark kitchen, shared an Imperial Stout, and enjoyed the silence.</p>

          <p>Movers came this morning and moved a bunch of stuff out of the house that we’ve (mostly Gay) been packing up the last few weeks. Our listing agent, <a href="http://www.seattlefineproperties.com/about-Bob-Bennion.asp">Bob Bennion</a>, recommended them and, as expected, did a professional job. The mover is <a href="http://www.bekins.com/moving/">Bekins</a>, which we’ve learned is still a family-owned business dating back to 1891 – our agent’s name is Paul Bekins, from a long list of Bekins’ involved in the family business. You don’t see that very often.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5697311298/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5149/5697311298_9bb31e2265.jpg" alt="IMG_0962" /></a></p>

<p>Then, Megan and Lori, who work for Bob, came over to get the details on the house and for us to sign the paperwork. They also brought a photographer, Buck (drives a Mini), to take photos of the house for the listing. It should go on the market next Wednesday.</p>

<p>We’re pricing it almost 10% below where all the agents suggested we list it at to get it to sell quickly. Coincidentally, it’s the exact price the house was listed at 10 years ago when we bought it! And that was in a buyer’s market and well before the real estate bubble. So someone is going to get all the improvements we’ve done to it for a 2001-level price.</p>

          <p>Fareed Zakaria:</p>

<blockquote>But the truth is this is a huge, devastating blow to al Qaeda, which had already been crippled by the Arab Spring. It is not an exaggeration to say that this is the end of al Qaeda in any meaningful sense of the word.

...
With the death of bin Laden, the central organizing ideology that presented an existential seduction to the Muslim world and an existential threat to the Western world is damaged beyond repair. We’re left with free-lance terrorists who will, of course, be able to inflict some harm. But the Somali pirates are able to inflict harm on civilians, and that doesn’t turn them into an existential threat to the Western world.

That existential threat is gone.</blockquote>

<p>We were watching 60 Minutes when a news crawl came across the screen announcing that Obama was going to deliver an address to the nation. We quickly checked the Internet and saw the headlines that Bin Laden is dead. </p>

<p>Things I love about the story so far:
<!-- more -->
He was killed, not captured. No 5-year media circus trial. He wasn’t found dead, we went and got him. </p>

<p>No Americans were killed in the operation, which involved a fire fight. We did it perfectly – Mission Accomplished! Allah didn’t care about helping him, even on a Sunday. </p>

<p>He was killed in a mansion. He wasn’t in a cave suffering for the Muslim struggle, he was living large in a mansion. Hypocrite. </p>

<p>Obama pointed out that Bin Laden killed Muslims in his attacks: “He’s not a Muslim leader, he’s a mass-murderer of Muslims.”</p>

<p>There must be tons of evidence inside that house pointing to the other idiots in al-Qaeda. Their days are numbered. </p>

<p>One of Bin Laden’s sons was killed. Like in The Godfather, you can’t leave sons to avenge his father’s death. </p>

<p>A woman in the house was killed because she was used as a human shield by Bin Laden’s security. Assholes from beginning to end. <strong>Update:</strong> the woman was one of Bin Laden’s wives and he himself used her to shield himself from gunfire. Classy guy.</p>

          <p>The Seattle Times published <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/pacificnw/2014828752_pacificpcapitolhill01.html?syndication=rss">an article</a> about our new neighborhood, about how it used to be filled with large Catholic families. It’s a bit overly-nostalgic for the “good ol’ days”, as if good childhoods are a thing of the past. </p>

<p>The Mona mentioned in the article is a teacher at the preschool we want to get Hudson into. And I can see the dome of the <a href="http://www.holynames-sea.org/">Holy Names Academy</a>, which is a beautiful building, from my office window.</p>
