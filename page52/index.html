          <p>Eva is 5 months old today. Her temperament is still very good and she’s sleeping for long stretches at night more and more often. She is much more active when put in one of her play circle things, spinning around on her own and playing with the toys. She’s not as ticklish as she was a month ago, it’s hard to get her to giggle anymore when we tickle her tummy or neck. She’s started eating solids on occasion and has been very good at it, not spitting it most of it up like the other kids did. She is more responsive when you call her name and turns to look at you.</p>

          <p>We had to be out of the house for the broker’s open house this morning and Gay’s mom was flying in this morning, so it was the perfect time to schedule the monthly Project Review meeting with Schuchart/Dow. We took the kids into Seattle to go to the house and pick up Ruth.</p>

<p>We got to the house at 10am and got to see the changes in the last week: the glass installed in the family room doors, grout in the basement bath tile, master bath vanities installed, the basement cabinetry installed, the butler’s pantry steel shelving installed and all the trim in the kids’ bedrooms has been painted. While we were there, the security company came over to install sensors on the new family room doors, the painters painted the trim in the master bath and the countertops were installed in the butler’s pantry.</p>

<p>Jim and Katie came over and we talked about the landscape plan and got some good advice from Jim, and then we had our Project Review meeting over a <a href="http://www.boulevard.com/BoulevardBeers/seeyoulator-doppelbock/">Boulevard Seeyoulator Doppelbock</a>.</p>

<p>While Mark and I adjusted a couple security cameras and mocked up the wood paneling in the basement theater, Gay took the kids and ran down to Renton to pick up her mom and brought her back to the house so she could see it for the first time.</p>

<p>Todd from Olson Kundig also stopped by to drop off the blueprints for the house on Vashon that we gave them over a year ago and to get a tour of the house so far.</p>

<p>We went to Elysian Brewery for dinner during <a href="http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2011/05/06/elysian-brewing-celebrates-15-years-on-capitol-hill-with-15-favorite-beers">their 15-year celebration</a>.</p>

          <p>Nothing makes me appreciate my kids’ mother than having to take care of them all day by myself.</p>

<p>Gay, I don’t know how you do it, especially with a 4-month baby too and managing the house renovation, I can barely manage it <em>with</em> your help. You’re on top of everything, from meals to clothes to school to activities for the kids. Having a nanny during the week helps, but you do everything the other 128 hours a week. That they’re great kids proves that I have very little to do with it. I’m glad they have you and since they always call for for mommy, not daddy, I know they are glad they have you too.</p>

          <p>The second big doors were getting installed today and they were using a crane to do it, which I thought Hudson would love to see, so we got up early at 5:30a and packed everyone into the car and took the 7:55a ferry. Hudson woke up asking to see the crane lift the doors (“I want to see the big crane lift the doors”), so my talk about it last night worked.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5696070979/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2526/5696070979_f10d26f327.jpg" alt="IMG_3304" /></a></p>

<p>We stopped at Top Pot for doughnuts on the way for everyone at the house, including 2 pink ones with sprinkles (the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Homer+Simpson+doughnut&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=ivnso&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OGbFTYOuBov2tgO79snDAQ&amp;ved=0CB0QsAQ&amp;biw=1132&amp;bih=1147">Homer Simpson doughnut</a>) for Havana and Hudson, of course. We got to the house at 8:30 and the north opening in the wall was already taken down. They told me it wasn’t as exciting as I imagined it’d be (they were right – I watched it on the security camera DVR). Havana and Hudson pretended to drive the crane truck while they prepared the opening for the door jamb. Mark gave me my very own (with my name on it) Shuchart/Dow hardhat too.</p>

<p>The crane moved very slowly so it wasn’t as exciting for Hudson after the first 10 minutes so he and Havana ran around the yard most of the time instead. By 10:30 the door jamb was in place and they started putting the doors on. That took an hour or so and they spent the rest of the day fastening the jamb in place, installing the lock hardware and boarding it up.</p>

<p>The doors look amazing, they did a nice job building them, which is a relief because it took us a while to pick the right builder from three possibilities. Schuchart/Dow helped us figure out what the differences between the builders would be so we knew what was worth paying for and what we didn’t care about, but you never know how they’ll turn out until you actually see them. They feel great to open and they don’t yet have the glass (“glazing” in industry-speak) in them, which will add quite a bit more weight to them, and should make them even smoother. I don’t think the kids will be opening them anytime soon.</p>

<p>They took up all the protective paper on the floors so the tile guys could grout the kitchen tile tomorrow, a Saturday, so we got to see the entire kitchen + family room floors together for the first time and can envision how it will look when it’s all done. The new doors let in a lot of light and make the floors look even better.</p>

<p>The tile in the master bathroom is mostly done, they were just finishing up the shower. We decided to use the same-sized tiles (2’ x 1’) in the shower as the rest of the bathroom as opposed to smaller 4”x4” versions because it will look better. The concern, though, is that the bigger tiles have fewer grout lines which, apparently, prevent the floor from being as slippery. The tiles are honed so they’re already less slippery, but when wet, you never know. I tested how slippery a small 4”x4” sample piece is that we had at home and the tile in our current shower tile is more slippery. We grabbed a big tile to bring home to test it for sure. But worst case, we can put a no-slip treatment on it if it’s too slippery.</p>

<p>The painting has started with priming the kids’ bedrooms and bathrooms and the master bath vanity cabinetry has arrived and should go in next week. The wood <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/04/22/lucky-wood/">we selected at Rhine</a> had arrived this week and the cabinet-makers have already picked up their part of it to build the basement cabinetry. 12th Ave Iron was there installing the butler’s pantry steel shelving. It looks great, but they couldn’t install it because they templated the space after the drywall was installed but before the mud was applied and the door trim was installed (Mark took responsibility, 12th Ave didn’t know), so it was off by 1/8” or so, which seems small to us, but they have to shave off the shelves a little to get them to fit. They’ve built new drawers for an existing closet in the dormer of our master bedroom and those are ready to be painted – the originals had no sliding hardware on them and didn’t quite fit anymore. The new electrical for <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/04/27/house-update/">the chandeliers</a> was completed this week too.</p>

<p>We talked with Mark about the landscaping plan and some concerns we have about it and then we left and went out to dinner at Elliot Bay. Hudson didn’t have a nap, but he was fine until we got in line for the ferry, when he started whining, which bothered Eva and made her cry, which Hudson thought was funny, so he kept making loud noises to scare her and kept her crying the whole way home. Kids are so delightful. By the time we got home and put them all to bed, Gay and I sat in a dark kitchen, shared an Imperial Stout, and enjoyed the silence.</p>

          <p>Movers came this morning and moved a bunch of stuff out of the house that we’ve (mostly Gay) been packing up the last few weeks. Our listing agent, <a href="http://www.seattlefineproperties.com/about-Bob-Bennion.asp">Bob Bennion</a>, recommended them and, as expected, did a professional job. The mover is <a href="http://www.bekins.com/moving/">Bekins</a>, which we’ve learned is still a family-owned business dating back to 1891 – our agent’s name is Paul Bekins, from a long list of Bekins’ involved in the family business. You don’t see that very often.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5697311298/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5149/5697311298_9bb31e2265.jpg" alt="IMG_0962" /></a></p>

<p>Then, Megan and Lori, who work for Bob, came over to get the details on the house and for us to sign the paperwork. They also brought a photographer, Buck (drives a Mini), to take photos of the house for the listing. It should go on the market next Wednesday.</p>

<p>We’re pricing it almost 10% below where all the agents suggested we list it at to get it to sell quickly. Coincidentally, it’s the exact price the house was listed at 10 years ago when we bought it! And that was in a buyer’s market and well before the real estate bubble. So someone is going to get all the improvements we’ve done to it for a 2001-level price.</p>
