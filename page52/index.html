              <p>I’ve noticed that I need to hold things farther away from my eyes when reading, so knew I’d need reading glasses soon. We went to our friendly neighborhood Costco for a vision test this afternoon and I got a prescription for reading glasses, picked out some frames and for just $117, should have my glasses next week.</p>

<p>I learned that I have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism#Ophthalmic_astigmatism">astigmatism</a>, but otherwise, my eyes are healthy and I don’t have a need for full-time glasses yet.</p>

              <p>Havana’s first day at Parkside was today. Gay and I went to parent orientation last Thursday evening to learn all the ins and outs of the school. She went to Parkside for a couple weeks of summer camp <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/08/06/first-month-in-the-house/">in August</a>.</p>

              <p>Our friends, Steve &amp; Renuka, live in Laurelhurst and invited us to the beach club there on Lake Washington. I assumed that it was just a beach, but you can actually go in the water. In fact, they have lifeguards, a floating diving platform and diving boards out on a dock! The place was packed with families. I had no idea such a place existed in Seattle!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/6141883142/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6183/6141883142_f3e4a67bff.jpg" alt="IMG_1347" /></a></p>

<p>Steve and Renuka brought a couple coolers full of food and drinks, we brought an appetizer and more drinks. The kids went to the beach, Hudson immediately found trucks to play with in the sand and Havana went with Owen and Claire into the water. Meg and Randy Bannecker and their kids also happened to be there so they joined us for dinner.</p>

<p>Steve cooked brats and burgers and we had a relaxing time not worrying about the kids running around. At one point, we couldn’t find Hudson and a couple girls brought him to us and told us he was walking around way out on the dock by himself – one day I plan to be a responsible parent, but I’m clearly still a long way from that.</p>

<p>The kids had a great time, and were very tired by the time we got home and went to sleep right away. It’s yet another example of why we’re glad we moved back into the city and close to amenities like this.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>The neighbor kid who was mowing our lawn hurt his foot while training for long-distance running, so had to stop mowing the lawn. I don’t mind, I like mowing the lawn so it was an excuse for me to get a new lawn mower. I ordered one from homedepot.com because they had free shipping for it and said it’d be here in 3-5 days. It ended up taking 10 days to get here and when it did, it was broken. The bolt that holds the handle was bent, preventing it from being tightened.</p>

<p>I called Home Depot and they said I could just pick a new one up at a local store, which I should have done in the first place.</p>

<p>We took it to the Home Depot in West Seattle that had the same  model and exchanged it. When we got home and opened the box, we discovered mouse poop inside right away. The box was partially opened at the store, so a mouse must’ve gotten into it. But, of course, it couldn’t get out, so it must still be inside. It turned out that there wasn’t just one mouse, but 6 mice and 2 were still alive.</p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_1260.jpg"><img src="http://troyandgay.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_1260.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>How do we get rid of a box with two live mice in it? We can’t just throw it away and introduce mice to the house.</p>

<p>Gay called Home Depot and, to their credit, offered to come pick up the box with the mice. We left it out while <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/09/10/laurelhurst-beach-club/">we went to the Laurelhurst Beach Club</a> and by the time we got home, it was gone. Thanks Home Depot! (But you really should get rid of your mouse problem.)</p>

He went there this summer for a couple weeks in August, so he’s used to it and loves it. His friends are Ryker and Josie and seems to play with the trains all day, is a little shy but seems to like singing songs.</p>
