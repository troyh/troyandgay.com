        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>This week, the Tacoma/Tahlequah ferry that runs from the south end of Vashon Island to Tacoma was stopped for three days because a ferry broke down and, since the ferries are currently undergoing maintenance (all at the same time), there was no ferry to replace it. So they just stopped running it. All that ferry traffic had to leave from the north end of the island, which was too much traffic for the ferries and that caused delays of up to 90 minutes. The Tahlequah ferry came back today, Thursday, but with a smaller ferry, causing more delays for those riders.</p>

<p>The Washington State Ferry system is a mess. Prices continue to go up and service continues to go down. It’s a perfect example of how poorly government-run businesses work. How did we get this way? The Seattle Weekly this week has “an article that explains”:http://seattleweekly.com/2008-03-05/news/how-puget-sound-s-last-pirate-gave-us-a-creaking-sinking-ferry-system.php. Long story short, a businessman who ran the private ferry system the first half of the 20th Century was prevented by the government from raising fares to cover his costs, so he sold the ferries to the idiots in the Seattle government who believed they could run them more efficiently and not have to raise fares. Today, it costs us $18 to get to the island ($21 in the peak summer season) and the fares go up and up and up and they’re still losing money running the ferries.</p>

<p>Even more crazy, the government thought the ferries would be temporary because Puget Sound would have a network of bridges within a few years. That never happened and it never seems to even be considered anymore even though the Evergreen Freedom Foundation says it would “save Washington State tax-payers $7.3 billion”:http://www.effwa.org/transportation/alternate_puget_sound_solution.php. Why not? Because the growth-fearing Vashon Island residents, myself excluded, “don’t want a bridge”:http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEEDA1138F932A25750C0A964958260.</p>

<p>That was 1992, though, when the economics of the ferries still seemed to be working – even though the government and the businessman who sold the ferries to it knew in the 1950s that a car ferry system was not economically viable. Because the island is so inaccessible, Vashon Island has only one (or two, depending on who you ask) good restaurants, a grocery store with monopoly pricing and higher gas prices. Yet, time and time again, the biggest complaints islanders have about Vashon is that there are not enough restaurants, the grocery store’s prices are too high and you have to go into Seattle to get cheaper gas. A bridge would solve those problems. I wonder how bad the ferries will have to get before Vashon Islanders agree that a bridge, and economic progress, can be a good thing.</p>

<p>I kegged a batch of beer today that I brewed almost four weeks ago, an IPA(India Pale Ale). It’s my first batch in six months. I want to brew more regularly now.</p>

          <p>We took the car to the Lexus dealer in Bellevue for its complimentary 1,000-mile checkup and the optional Lexus Personalized Settings change (some personalization settings require the dealer to do it).</p>

<p>Lexus tries to make their dealerships a more pleasant experience, even “making some into spas”:http://carsdiva.wordpress.com/2008/01/14/five-star-hotels-spas-and-car-dealerships/, and “Lexus of Bellevue”:http://www.lexusofbellevue.com/ is no exception. We pulled up to the service entrance, parked the car and went into the service area, which is a row of “offices” for the “Service Representatives”, who are all well-dressed and polite. The woman shook our hand, introduced herself, asked us to sit while she entered the work items into the computer. Once she was done, she asked us if we wanted to be taken somewhere while we waited. Rather than be given a trip to a shopping center, we opted to hang out at the dealer. We had free bottled water and a cookie, walked around the showroom (and were never harassed by a salesman), browsed through the Lexus shop, went outside to the putting greens and played fake golf, then came back in for some espresso and TV in one of the many lounge areas that are as nice as a decent hotel’s lobby. WiFi is available throughout the place and they even have a playroom for kids. There were several customers around the dealership reading one of several newspapers offered, some with laptops doing work, all looking very comfortable. It took two hours, but it was the most enjoyable two hours I’ve ever spent at a car dealer.</p>

<p>We were also recently at the Jeep dealer having work done on it and the difference is night-and-day. At the “Jeep dealer”:http://www.townandcountryjeep.com/, you drive the car into the garage with all the mechanics using power tools, so it’s hard to talk to the gruff service desk guy. You fill out your own paperwork telling them what you want them to do, they take your keys and they look at you like “Why are you still here?”. The dealership is like walking into the 1970s; you can have some coffee but it’s one of those Bunn commercial coffee makers you find in office lunch rooms. And they have one couch to sit on. Not surprisingly, no one was waiting at the dealership.</p>

          <p>With all the bleak talk about our economy and the lousy performance of the stock market over “the last year”:http://finance.google.com/finance?chdnp=0&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=1&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1204664400000&amp;chddm=98923&amp;q=INDEXSP:.INX (down 5.61%), I wondered if the stock market is <em>really</em> lower than it should be right now. I plotted the value of the S&amp;P 500 since January 2, 1990 and compared it to the desired 10% annual growth rate:</p>

<p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/blog/pix/2008/03/picture-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The green line shows what the stock market would have done had it done a stable 10% return every year. The blue line shows the actual prices of the S&amp;P 500. So, yes, the stock market is lower than where it “should be” right now. The dot-com bubble and crash were bad, but today we’re almost at the historical peak.</p>

<p>“Roethlisberger signed a $102 million 8-year contract”:http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08063/862127-66.stm?cmpid=steelers.xml. He’s the highest-paid Steeler ever and possibly the highest-paid player in the NFL. That’s justified… he’s been one of the top 3 QBs in all of his only 4 years in the NFL, including a Super Bowl win. I hope the Steelers can improve their offensive line this year to protect Roethlisberger better than they have the last couple years. But they made it harder by letting Alan Faneca go. “He signed with the New York Jets”:http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08062/861895-66.stm?cmpid=steelers.xml becoming the highest-paid offensive lineman in NFL history with a $40 million 5-year contract.</p>
