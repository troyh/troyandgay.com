            <p>We spent Sunday in San Francisco. We went to “21st Amendment”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/17/21st-amendment-brewpub-review/ for lunch then drove over the Golden Gate Bridge into Marin County and over to Tiburon.</p>

<p>After our little tour of Marin, we went back into the city to our hotel. We relaxed in the hotel room until dinner time. We went downstairs to try the hotel restaurant but they were closed on Sunday. We were too tired to walk around and it was getting late for Havana’s bedtime, so we decided to get room service instead.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>I’d heard of “The 21st Amendment”:http://21st-amendment.com from “The Brewing Network”:http://thebrewingnetwork.com/, a 4-hour once-a-week radio show (and “podcast”:http://www.thebrewingnetwork.com/archive.php) that is what Howard Stern would be if he only talked about beer and brewing beer (and I mean that in a good way, I love Howard Stern). I’m still not sure what the affiliation is between the show and this brewpub, but there’s something that links the two. I like the show when I can spare 4 hours to listen to it so I was very curious about 21st Amendment. On our visit to San Francisco, I finally got the chance and dragged my wife and infant daughter to the place to check it out.</p>

<p>I had the IPA and the Pale Ale, both were very good. But it took a long time to get our drinks after they were ordered. How long does it take to pour a beer? We went at 1pm on a Sunday and they only had five of their beers on tap. I really wanted to try their Double Trouble Imperial IPA(India Pale Ale), “The beer to bring world peace and end the war”, so I asked the waitress if I could buy their other beers to-go and she said we <em>might</em> be able to buy some of the regular IPA but no other beers. They have a slogan on the coasters and the t-shirts: “We drink what we can. We can what we drink.”, which is an ad for their canned beers. By that, you’d think they can their beers so you can buy them. But they only can <em>one</em> of their beers! The waitress said they sell growlers but that they were “all out of growlers”. What does that mean? Do they pre-fill growlers? That’d be weird.</p>

<p>I got a little sticker-shock at the price of a beer: $5.50! At a place they brew their own beer and have no middlemen they should be able to charge less, not more. The beer is good, but not $5.50 good.</p>

<p>What about the restaurant? The food was about average and the service was below average. I ordered the onion rings with my sandwich and they “hadn’t yet made the onion rings” so I had to get fries instead. Again, this was Sunday at 1pm and they hadn’t made the onion rings yet – when were they planning to make them? The place was fairly busy, we had to wait five minutes to be seated, but the hostess spent most of the time we were there reading the paper while other people were clearing tables and our waitress had to be flagged down to get anything.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We checked out of the hotel in Monterey Saturday morning and were on the road by 9am. We arrived in San Francisco, after a couple hours touring the area in between, at 3:30pm.</p>

<p>Our first stop was in Los Gatos, in the mountains before we reached Silicon Valley. The town was really cute so we parked, took out the stroller and walked around for a good while. They were having an Easter Egg hunt in the yard of the high school so we took Havana there where she saw chickens, bunny rabbits and ponies. We really like Los Gatos but it was still too early for lunch so we got back on the highway.</p>

<p>Next stop was Apple headquarters in Cupertino:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2335407243/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2145/2335407243_ed8f80f96e.jpg" alt="Apple Headquarters" /></a></p>

<p>And wouldn’t you know it, there’s a brewpub right next to Apple called “BJ’s Restaurant &amp; Brewhouse”:http://www.bjsbrewhouse.com/ so we went there for lunch. Gay’s getting sick of my brewpub tour, but when in Rome…. I ordered their seasonal ESB and later 4 samplers: Pale Ale, Irish Red, an Imperial Stout and their seasonal Oatmeal Stout. The ESB, pale and Imperial Stout and Oatmeal Stout were all very good. I’m usually not a fan of red ales and theirs was my least favorite of this group.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2336276130/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3260/2336276130_ed4d0bf811.jpg" alt="Beer samples at BJ's Restaurant &amp; Brewhouse, Cupertino, CA" /></a></p>

<p>I ordered a turkey club sandwich, Gay got a mini deep-dish pizza and Havana got an appetizer sampler of avocado egg rolls, a southwestern egg roll, mozzarella sticks and artichoke and spinach dip. The food was about what you’d expect at a brewpub or even a cut above most brewpubs. If I worked at Apple, I’d be at this place often (especially with their “curbside take out”:http://www.bjsbrewhouse.com/curbside.aspx). It turns out that BJ’s is a chain with locations across the country, but I’ve never heard of it since they have none in Washington (“yet”:http://www.bjsbrewhouse.com/locations.aspx). I may have to stop at the one in Eugene on the way home.</p>

<p>After lunch, back on the highway to visit Google’s headquarters and drive around Silicon Valley, through Palo Alto, around Stanford University, through Los Altos and then Mountain View. It’s kinda stupid to drive around looking for the buildings of tech companies, but I was last in the valley in 1995 or 1996, straight from Virginia, and I really liked it then. I wanted to see it again to see if it was like I remembered it was. It wasn’t. Lots of traffic and lots of strip malls. Still not Northern Virginia bad, but getting there. Living in Seattle for so long now must’ve raised my standards.</p>

<p>Enough of that, we headed north into San Francisco. We checked into the hotel, “Hotel Vitale”:http://www.hotelvitale.com/, at 3:30.</p>

<p>We had a sushi dinner at “Ozumo”:http://www.ozumo.com/. Pretty spendy, but Havana had her first sushi so it was priceless. I was probably 24 years old when I first had sushi, she’s had sushi at 42 weeks old. She’s off to a good food start.</p>

            <p>We drove to Avila Beach and then back to SLO to catch Highway 1 up the coast to Monterey. We arrived in Monterey at 4pm.</p>

<p>Our first stop on Highway 1 was the “Hearst Castle”:http://www.hearstcastle.com/ in San Simeon. They give tours of the castle, William Randolph Hearst’s house, but the tours are an hour and forty-five minutes and baby strollers are not allowed. We didn’t want to spend that much time there and I didn’t want to carry Havana around for that long either. So we didn’t take the tour. We walked through the little museum instead and Havana had some snacks outside.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3115/2333395611_3fd84b867a.jpg?v=0" alt="" /></p>

<p>Back in the car and up Highway 1 for a couple hours to “Carmel”:http://www.carmelcalifornia.com/. This was another curvy road, but not as bad as earlier roads and the view over the Pacific Ocean on a sunny day was worth it. We stopped in Carmel for lunch at a little Italian place. It was sunny out so we sat outside by ourselves and watched the people walk by. Havana had a grilled cheese sandwich, which was pretty tasty to me too. Gay and I had bruschetta for a starter and I had duck and goat cheese ravioli and Gay had gnocchi. Both were very good with a glass of wine.</p>

<p>We walked around the town a bit after lunch. Carmel is very quaint, one of the few towns I’d describe that way that we’ve visited on this trip. We then drove 5 miles up the road to Monterey to spend the night. We were tired and Havana went to bed early so we stayed in and ordered room service.</p>

            <p>We left Thursday morning at 9:30am and arrived in San Luis Obispo by 3:30pm. This was the best drive of the trip, good weather, little traffic and great scenery.</p>

<p>We had to stop for two Havana breaks, in “Gilroy”:http://www.ci.gilroy.ca.us/ (home of the famous “Garlic Festival”:http://www.gilroygarlicfestival.com/) for a diaper change and in “King City”:http://www.kingcity.com/ for lunch.</p>

<p>After checking into the hotel, we drove to downtown SLO for dinner at the “Downtown Brewery”:http://www.downtownbrew.com/new/. The food was so-so and the beer was too. Unfortunately, I left the camera at the hotel so no photos. There’s a Farmer’s Market every Thursday evening, so we walked through that for a while. It’s less of a Farmer’s Market and more of a street fair – there was very little produce, it was mostly local businesses with stands showing off what they’re selling.</p>

<p>We stayed at the “Embassy Suites”:http://embassysuites1.hilton.com/en_US/es/hotel/SLOCAES-Embassy-Suites-San-Luis-Obispo-California/index.do, which has a nice atrium. But at night, the bar in the atrium is open until 11pm and voices echo throughout the atrium, so we could hear the conversations from the bar better than our own conversation. And of course, in such a situation, there’s always one guy with a hearty laugh who laughs every few minutes. The noise went on until almost midnight. Havana could sleep through it, though.</p>
