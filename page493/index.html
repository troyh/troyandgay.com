            <p>1 year ago today, terrorists attacked the United States. Today, its all cleaned up, the Taliban in Afghanistan is out of power and a new government is in place, Al-Qaeda is significantly hampered, Osama bin Laden may or may not be dead, several top-level Al-Qaeda people are either dead or are in custody, and Bush is seriously interested in invading Iraq and removing Hussein.</p>

<p>Hopefully, in one more year, Osama bin Laden will be dead or captured, Al-Qaeda is a laughing stock, Islamic fundamentalists are shunned by Muslims, and Saddam Hussein is out of power in Iraq.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>The new submissions process for recipes went into effect. Recipes submitted on the site now go into the database rather than to text files. This makes it easier to work with the submissions, makes it possible to show users the status of their submissions and even edit their submissions, although we don’t yet do that. Eventually, all submissions (reviews and photos) will work this way too.</p>

            <p>Kelly Electric came out and finished up running ethernet through the house. We now have an ethernet jack in the office and ethernet running into the crawl space, where it is running up to the stereo closet so our 802.11b access point can be centrally-located. Eventually, we’ll put a machine in there connected to an input of the stereo to stream MP3s throughout the house stereo.</p>
