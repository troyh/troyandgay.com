            <p>Had dinner with Gary and Nancy at La Playa last night.  …incidentally the market dropped 4%, the second sharpest decline this year.  …and we discovered that our 401ks are in HALF since we left MSFT in 99.</p>

            <p>Zowie! If we get <a href="http://www.9thtee.com/turbonet.htm">TurboNET</a>
we can network our TiVo even easier than before because <em>Support for the TurboNET is now built-in to the TiVo software</em>!</p>

<p>And <a href="http://lukwam.com/tivo/">here’s a guy</a> who is publishing what is currently playing on, what is recorded on his TiVo, what he is subscribed to and his Season Passes at this very instant.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Jon Udell wrote an article (in May) about <a href="http://www.byte.com/documents/s=7181/byt1022183228615/0527_udell.html">Personal RSS Aggregators</a>. It’s a good description of how cool RSS is and personal RSS aggregators are the future of news delivery. I just found <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> which is nice.</p>

<p>Years ago at Stream, I did 3 projects in succession that were all “personal news services” and I was pretty excited about having computers pick news just for you. Back then, it was not very easy since you needed a lot of newsfeeds with a lot of meta info already pulled out, plus, without the , all the transport mechanisms were custom (remember Lotus’ NotesNet??). RSS makes it possible with real humans doing the news selection.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Another day of fighting fires: woke up and some idiot at alcatel.com is using WebCopier to archive the entire site; blocked him. Then memphis is completely maxed out handling a humoungous mail from cron on newyork after running the trigger/handler code. For some reason, apache on berlin simply stopped working and had to be restarted.</p>
