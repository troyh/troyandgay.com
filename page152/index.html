            <p>Palin says she’s going to “put ‘the government’s checkbook’ online”:http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/09/18/palins-transparency-proposal-already-exists-in-dc/ so everyone can see what the government spends money on. The problem is that it’s already there: “USASpending.gov”:http://usaspending.gov. And which Senator did it in 2006? Barack Obama.</p>

<p>It’ll be fun to watch how many more stupid things she says and does in the next six weeks. Forget vetting her, they should have just given her an IQ test.</p>

<p>We’ve seriously cut back on our Manhattan drinking since Gay’s been either pregnant or nursing for the last 24 months. But a Manhattan sounded good on a Friday evening. We did a little taste test between our favorite Maker’s Mark and “Bulleit”:http://www.bulleitbourbon.com/home.htm. I like Bulleit and have been having it straight on occasion (i.e., when I’m out of Maker’s Mark) but never in a Manhattan until now.</p>

<p>We still prefer Maker’s Mark, but Bulleit is the only other bourbon I’ve had that I could drink in a Manhattan. It has a more aggressive taste than Maker’s Mark and is fairly spicy similar to Woodford Reserve. But all around, being a bit sweeter, Maker’s Mark makes a more enjoyable Manhattan, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Maker’s Mark trivia that I recently learned: Maker’s Mark was created to be the best bourbon for a Manhattan.</p>

            <p>I finally got an “SLR”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera camera, a “Canon EOS 450D”:http://www.dpreview.com/news/0801/08012403canoneos450d.asp (or it’s “maverick-style” name Canon Digital Rebel XSi), in the hopes of taking better photos.</p>

<p>I posted the best ones in “their own Photoset”:http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/sets/72157607352909589/ on Flickr.</p>

<p>It’s not as convenient to carry as a tiny point-and-shoot, but the quality is much higher and I can get different lenses to take more interesting shots. Now I need to get an HD camcorder to take better-quality videos of the kids before they grow up.</p>

          </h3>
            <p><img src="http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z172/bruinbirdman/john-mccain.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>On the worst day in the stock market since 9/11, McCain announces his idea for solving our economic problems. He explains the cause:</p>

<p>bq. the old-boy network and the corruption in Washington is directly involved and one of the causes of this financial crisis that we’re in today.</p>

<p>I wonder if McCain has forgotten that he was part of that “old-boy network and corruption in Washington” for the last 26 years. I know he hopes we all forgot.</p>

<p>So his solution is to create a “a high-level commission”:http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/16/america/NA-POL-US-Elections.php to investigate similar to the “9/11 commission”:http://www.9-11commission.gov/. We’ll ignore the fact that the Bush administration ignored all the recommendations of the 9/11 commission report, but McCain thinks bureaucrats will solve the problems that, he believes, bureaucrats created.</p>

<p>He is correct that bureaucrats created the problem. Republicans and McCain hate regulation and the housing and banking crisis we’re experiencing was caused by the de-regulation that the Republicans have wanted for years and got in the mid-1990s. “McCain supported the de-regulation”:http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=s1999-105 that caused it! In fact, <strong>38 of the 39 Democrats in Congress voted against it and all 44 Republicans voted for it</strong>. This was a problem clearly created by Republicans, as McCain correctly pointed out.</p>

<p>Now, McCain’s own economic advisor has a solution:</p>

<p>bq. a McCain economics and policy adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said any plan should include regulation of all sorts of financial institutions, consumer protections, improved corporate governance and “systems stability” programs.</p>

<p>In other words, we just need to undo McCain’s mistake. Yet McCain  thinks we need a commission to spend several years thinking about it. Republicans have no understanding of economics beyond cutting taxes.</p>
