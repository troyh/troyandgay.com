          </h3>
            <p>“Speaking in Seattle”:http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/04/bill-gates-what.html, this statement on open source has to go down in history as one of Bill Gates’ dumbest statements ever:</p>

<p>bq. Open source, he said, creates a license “so that nobody can ever improve the software,”</p>

<p>The truth is that open source creates a license so that <em>anyone</em> can <em>always</em> improve the software. That’s the opposite of what he believes. Religion. On the bright side, he’s giving lots of money to scientists to cure diseases around the world. Then again, he won’t allow scientists that get grant money from his foundation to use open source software and requires that they purchase software from a certain software company.</p>

<p>He likes to claim that open source is anti-capitalist too. He may be a capitalist, but he’s no economist. If he were an economist, he would understand that Microsoft may not have made as much money if they sold open source software, but all the companies that spend millions on Microsoft software would have saved a lot of money. If they didn’t have to pay for software, they could employ more people or spend more on research and development. More R&amp;D and more employed people drives the economy forward, which is very capitalist.</p>

<p>To put it in perspective, Microsoft makes $51 billion a year in revenue selling software to businesses. Instead of paying for software, their customers could employ 510,000 additional people with salaries of $100K every year. But Microsoft employs less than 80,000 people, so Microsoft alone causes a net loss of 430,000 high-paid ($100K/yr) jobs per year or 1,290,000 people of average-salaried ($33K/yr) jobs per year to the world’s economy.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We had a rare date night last night and we went to “La Spiga”:http://www.laspiga.com/, an Italian restaurant. These days when we go out we go early so we can get home and to bed by 9pm. This works out well for me because restaurants have this many people in them at 5:30pm:</p>

<p>I love having a restaurant all to myself – you get attentive service and you don’t overhear conversations between people who think they have something important enough to say that the whole restaurant needs to hear it. To be fair, the place was more crowded by the end of our dinner and there were no loud-talkers.</p>

<p>The food was good, not great, but good. I had gnocchi and a rack of lamb, which was cooked perfectly. Gay had a tagliatelle pasta with a meat sauce and veal dish for a second. I don’t know much about Italian wines but the waitress recommended a good one, which it should be at $14/glass. Since Gay can’t drink, I order glasses of wine at restaurants (unless it’s a good beer place) and I’ve discovered that a glass of wine is expensive these days. It must be more common now to order glasses of wine at restaurants. One glass of wine cost more than my first course!</p>

<p>The best part of the restaurant is the decor. It’s a large place with old exposed timber beams, concrete walls with steel fixtures. Very modern but still very casual.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Our doorbell rang yesterday by a guy who introduced himself as “the one who bought the shit shack down the street”, referring to our beloved “neighbor house”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/02/29/pigs-house-what-150k-buys-in-the-seattle-area/. After I congratulated him on his purchase, he told me that he wanted to sell it now rather than fix it up because he doesn’t live on the island and didn’t want to do the work. He implied that the previous owner was going to buy it back from him and because “this is a nice neighborhood” and he didn’t want “that to happen again”, he’s offering the house for sale at $175K ($25K more than he paid).</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>He gave me a paper that he’s distributing to the neighborhood (bad grammar and all):</p>

<p>bq. My name is [name omitted] I am the owner of the little house at the beginning of the road [address omitted]. The house is now for sale to the people in the neighborhood. The original plan was to fix the house up and rent it out, plans changed. I have turned my focus towards other investments.</p>

<p>bq. If you are interested you can call me at [phone number omitted]</p>

<p>bq. Thanks. [name omitted]</p>

<p>He’s trying to sell me a house that he refers to as “the shit shack”. Wouldn’t “rustic cozy fixer-upper” be a more appealing description to a potential buyer?</p>

<p>His problem is that he paid $150K for property that is worth half that and he’d have to spend $50K or more to put a cute little house on it to sell it. And could he get more than $200K for it? Whatever he was thinking about property values here was clearly wrong. I feel sorry for the guy because he’s very young (20?) and now has a $150K mortgage to pay off <em>and</em> he has to pay property taxes on it.</p>

<p>I have no interest in buying it because the place is far cleaner than it used to be, so my problem is solved, and anyone who buys it is going to maintain or improve it so they can profit later. The only reason I’d buy it is so that it could return to a wooded area, which is going to happen anyway if no one buys it.</p>

<p>The previous owner can’t be stupid enough to buy it back. Or can they? They didn’t maintain the property because they got it free from her father, but once they put money into it, they have a strong incentive to maintain it. That’s my theory at least. It’ll be interesting to see what happens.</p>

            <p>We’ve watched a lot of movies lately, but unless they’re “so bad they annoy me”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/29/i-wish-there-was-no-country-for-bad-movie-makers/, I haven’t reviewed them. Catching up a little…</p>

<!-- more -->

<p><em>There Will Be Blood</em>: Very good movie and story. Daniel Day-Lewis is a great actor and very deserving of his Oscar win. Except for a couple splashes of oil on the camera lens, it was very well-made too.</p>

<p><em>Juno</em>: it started really annoyingly with the dialogue clearly intending to create as many catch-phrases as possible, but thankfully that stopped and the movie improved. It wasn’t funny, although it tried to be, but it wasn’t your typical afternoon special movie either. Ellen Page was acceptable, but didn’t deserve the Oscar nomination.</p>

<p><em>Death at a Funeral</em>: I like British humor, but not the unfunny kind. This should have been a 10-minute short.</p>

<p><em>In The Valley of Elah</em>: Probably would have been better if not a true story, it just wasn’t interesting enough. But good acting.</p>

<p><em>Bee Movie</em>: Pixar clearly did not make this movie. Dumb story – bees sue humans for selling honey and not paying the bees – and just filled with stupid bee puns.</p>

<p><em>Dan In Real Life</em>: Entertaining, but the family was so “perfect” it was implausible – what family puts on a talent show complete with costumes to entertain themselves? Only one that has Dane Cook in it, I’m sure.</p>

<p><em>Things We Lost In The Fire</em>: The screenplay should have been lost in a fire.</p>

<p><em>I Am Legend</em>: I like Will Smith and this was as entertaining as anything he’s done. Mostly just a zombie movie, though.</p>

<p><em>Michael Clayton</em>: This movie should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Tom Wilkinson was far better as a crazy guy than Javier Bardem in that lousy movie that actually did win Best Picture. The story was interesting and the pacing and timeline always kept me interested.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>The Onion’s “man-on-the-street interviews”:http://www.theonion.com/content/amvo/poll_mccain_getting_even?utm_source=onion_rss_daily about McCain running close to Democrats in national polls:</p>

<p>bq. “The American people are getting harder and harder to predict when they start wanting a white man for president.”</p>

<p>Interestingly, McCain “technically isn’t a natural-born citizen”:http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23415028/, which is a requirement set in the Constitution to be President. He was born on a US military base in Panama. Congress has “a resolution up this week”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/18/us/politics/18web-hulse.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin to special-case McCain to officially consider him a natural-born citizen. Of course he’s a citizen and should be eligible to be President, but I find it interesting how “strict Constitutionalists” (read: right-wing Republicans) seem to pick and choose what the Constitution says and what it doesn’t say, similar to the way the interpret the Bible to say what they want it to say.</p>

<p>I’d be willing to bet that if Hillary or Barack were in a similar situation that the Republicans in Congress wouldn’t be questioning their eligibility – they’d certainly question their patriotism. McCain could be a “Manchurian Candidate”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manchurian_Candidate. After spending so many years in a Vietnam prison camp, we can’t be sure that he wasn’t brainwashed by the communists, can we?</p>
