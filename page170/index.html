<p>On ONN, Al Qaeda “refutes the 9/11 conspiracy theories”:http://www.theonion.com/content/video/9_11_conspiracy_theories that claim the US Government brought the WTC down. Favorite quotes of the Al Qaeda operative:</p>

<p>bq. “How would you like it if you spent two months in a mountain cave sleeping on rocks planning something really special only to have someone take the credit away from you?”</p>

<p>bq. “Why would they kill 3,000 of their own infidels?”</p>

<p>bq. “Why is Osama bin Laden safe in, uh, somewhere?”</p>

<p>bq. “It’s like talking to a goat!”</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Southwest Airlines pays people to get the FAA to avoid safety inspections on their planes and passes the savings on to their customers. I dislike government regulation because corporations being regulated quickly learn to schmooze regulators and regulators, being government employees, have no incentive to do a good job due to small and rare pay raises and job promotions, are easy prey. But given that a failure in an airplane causes many deaths, the FAA is a regulatory agency that I like. That is, until I hear that “the FAA works with the airlines and against safety”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/04/business/04plane.html?ex=1365048000&amp;en=3d8a1a9e7465655d&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss.</p>

<p>The safety guy in the FAA, Nicholas Sabatini, brushes off safety problems with progress made by the airlines and the manufacturers:</p>

<p>bq. Mr. Sabatini repeatedly cited statistics showing progress in aviation safety, saying the rate of fatal accidents had dropped by more than 60 percent in the 10 years ended Sept. 30, 2007.</p>

<p>He’s happy with 40% as many fatalities as a decade ago and thinks that’s an excuse to ignore safety concerns. I wonder if the rate would have dropped by more than 60% if he had been doing his job. He should be fired, but he won’t be:</p>

<p>bq. One committee member, Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Texas Democrat, asked Mr. Sabatini if the manager who had told Southwest to keep flying was still being paid. “Yes, ma’am,” he replied.</p>

<p>bq. “What do you have to do to get fired, then?” she asked.</p>

<p>Bush should be awarding several FAA officials medals of honor any day now.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Illy and Ouzo went to the vet today for the usual up-selling of additional services. Illy was supposed to get a tooth extracted but it turned out to be okay so it wasn’t removed. So they both only had a teeth-cleaning. Eight hours later they were home and lethargic as the anesthesia wore off. And I’ve never seen their teeth so clean. If only they’d brush their teeth more often.</p>
