          <p>Last year, Microsoft continued its winless record when it was found guilty of abusing its monopoly in Europe. And it sounds like the <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,4149,1549352,00.asp?kc=EWRSS03119TX1K0000594">EU is going to crack down on them</a>.</p>

          <p>Anyone watch <a href="http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/aaron.brown/index.html">Aaron Brown</a>? He’s the most wishy-washy news anchor I’ve ever seen. Instead of making statements, he hedges his bets by saying things like “It’s good news, or it’s not”, “It’s expensive, but maybe it’s inexpensive”, “It’s a nice day, or not”, “Sugar is sweet, or it could be sour”, “Earth is round, or maybe it’s flat”, etc. Hey Aaron: You’re annoying, or maybe you’re irritating.</p>

          <p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/nm/20040313/pl_nm/campaign_kerry_dc">Kerry requests monthly debates</a> so we can gauge for ourselves who is the best person for the job. But Bush refuses with a pathetic and downright insulting excuse! I’d rather see monthly live debates than 8 months of polished commercials daily. Bush, once again, lets America down. This guy thinks we work for him. We should <em>demand</em> that he debate so that the American people have more info to make their Nov 2 decision.</p>
