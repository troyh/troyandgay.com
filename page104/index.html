              <p>My dad’s still <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/10/31/my-dad-in-the-hospital/">in the hospital</a> and they just got the results of the bone scan this morning and the cancer has not spread to his bones, which is very good news! He’s leaving the hospital today and will have his kidney removed in the near future. I think we have to wait until then to find out if the tumor is cancerous and if it has spread to other organs.</p>

              <p>Today’s my 40th birthday. The government gave me a free hour and the NFL gave the Steelers the day off so they could celebrate my birthday too.</p>

<p>I had The Reverend Belgian Quadrupel Ale (to celebrate my 4 decades) from <a href="http://www.averybrewing.com/">Avery</a> while watching football and barbecuing the steaks. With dinner, we opened a bottle of <a href="http://www.kvintners.com/">K Vintners</a> El Jefe that we bought two years ago on a visit to Walla Walla.</p>

              <p>My dad had hernia surgery this week. At midnight on Friday/Saturday my dad felt bad and told my mom he wanted to go to the emergency room. He had a burning sensation in his chest and thought he was having a heart attack so they did an EKG and a CAT scan. His heart is fine but they happened to discover a tumor on his kidney. He’d be spending the weekend in the hospital and we’d all have to wait until Monday for a “bone scan” to determine if the cancer had spread to his bones.</p>

              <p>Hudson has finally learned to walk all by himself. Once<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4052544481/"> he figured out how to stand up by himself</a>, he just started walking everywhere. I don’t want to get into the habit of comparing the two, but Havana was walking before her first birthday so Hudson took two months longer. Part of this is that boys just develop more slowly than girls but Havana got a lot more attention and encouragement to walk from both of us since there was no older sibling to compete with for time and attention.</p>
