            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>We met with Tom and Dan this afternoon their third round of drawings. Today the firm, Olson Sundberg Kundig Allen, <a href="http://www.djc.com/news/ae/12012172.html">announced its name change</a> to the shorter Olson Kundig. A big change for a firm that has been around as long as they have. But it’s easier to say!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4114715147/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2579/4114715147_29f4d6ddbd.jpg" alt="Topography" /></a></p>

<p>The latest drawings included one was what we essentially designed at <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/11/05/architect-meeting-2/">the last meeting</a> and there were two modified versions of it. One of the alternatives had a different placement for the kitchen that we liked. We changed to that and spent some time taking the stuff we liked from last week’s design. The next drawing may be pretty close to the actual schematic design.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>We should have one more drawing and, assuming we don’t have any new ideas or changes, we will start working in the 3rd dimension. Even seeing it in two dimensions, I can tell it’s going to be a very cool house. But we’re wary of the cost. We want the house to have a rustic/unfinished look but, ironically, it costs more to look unfinished than it does to just nail up cheap 2x4s and slap drywall on them. And big glass walls are expensive. We’ll be involving contractors at some point to get an idea of the cost and to see how many compromises we’ll have to make to keep it under budget.</p>

<p>After Thanksgiving, Tom’s taking a month-long motorcycle trip from Seattle to Patagonia so we probably won’t get much done between now and the end of the year.</p>

<p>Using the survey data, they made a model of our property laser-cut out of cork, as can be seen in the photo above. Each “step” is 2 feet, so our property has more of an incline than you’d expect from looking at it in real life. The blocks represent different parts of the house and the sticks represent trees. One of our concerns with placing the garage farther north on the property was that it will be a steep climb (20 feet!) from the garage to the house. But we think we can build the garage a few feet higher and make the grade more smooth to lessen the climb.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Earlier this year, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2009233610_webdomestic18.html">Washington State passed  legislation</a> to bestow equal rights on same-sex couples that married couples have. As it has been in 31 other states, a Christian group called “Protect Marriage” launched an attack on it in Washington by putting it to a popular vote under the guise of “democracy”. Referendum 71 was born. A popular vote sounds like American democracy but anyone who went through high school understands (or should understand) that The Constitution of the US was written to, among other things, protect the minority from the tyranny of the majority.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>It’s important to note that this law in Washington is not about marriage, it just grants the same legal rights to same-sex couples that married couples are given. So it really has nothing to do with the hot-button word “marriage” – the Christians simply didn’t want people to have equal rights like hospital visitation rights, have access to shared health insurance, rules of inheritance, etc. Besides,  <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_dira.htm">the more religious a person is, the more likely they are to be divorced</a> so if the Christians want to protect marriage, they should stop throwing stones from inside their glass houses.</p>

<p>Washington State residents, however, defeated the bigots and approved Referendum 71, upholding the law. I’m proud to live in the state that is the first to uphold basic civil rights for same-sex couples!</p>

<p>Inter-racial marriage was legalized nationally in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia">a Supreme Court decision in 1967</a> but only <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/28417/most-americans-approve-interracial-marriages.aspx">accepted by the majority of the US population as late as 1983</a> and is still only at 77% today. <a href="http://contexts.org/socimages/2009/11/05/support-for-same-sex-marriage-by-age-and-state/">This graph</a> clearly shows that same-sex marriage opposition decreases as older generations die-off, so just as with the end to slavery, civil rights, women being allowed to vote, equal rights for same-sex couples will come to America. The only question is whether people born in the next few generations are embarrassed by their ancestors’ bigotry or not.</p>

<p><strong>Note to gay-bashers who happen upon this blog via Google:</strong> I am not gay. This site is called “TroyandGay” because it is the personal site for two people; one named “Troy” and the other named “Gay”, both heterosexuals. We simply support equal rights because we are Americans, we believe in equality for everyone, even people who are not exactly like us and we believe the Constitution should be upheld. So please spout your anti-gay rhetoric to someone who doesn’t yet know you’re a moron.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>We met with the architects this afternoon for the next round after <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/10/16/new-architect/">round 1</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4081743278/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2491/4081743278_edddf2bfc9.jpg" alt="Olson Sundberg Kundig Allen office" /></a>

<p>It could have gone either way after the last meeting – this round could turn out to be a good step forward or it could be just like the meetings with our previous architects where there was little new and the meetings were mostly a waste of time. Fortunately, it went great. We had a productive 2 hours and basically have the layout of the house decided, just like that! I can’t believe that after less than four weeks and just one iteration we’re way past where Miller-Hull was after 10 weeks and five meetings.</p>

<p>Today, Tom and Dan had three more evolutions of the initial four designs and one was pretty close to what we wanted. We explained what we liked and didn’t like about each of the designs and over the course of the meeting we hashed out some changes to that design. Tom’s very talented, he can listen to us and immediately start drawing and has good ideas on the spot. There’s still some minor details and the exact sizes of rooms to work out, but I think we’re pretty close on a floor plan.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to see the elevations, to start thinking in three dimensions and getting an idea of what the house will actually look like.</p>
