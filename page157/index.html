<p>Everything looks good. He still has the normal baby rash, which is pretty hideous, and far worse than the rash that Havana had.</p>

              <p>Ouzo will get his first chemotherapy treatment tomorrow morning. We won’t know how well it works other than to monitor his behavior but the doc thinks the tumor wouldn’t have to shrink much to alleviate the problem. And it has to stop growing, of course.</p>

<p>We should be able to pick him up tomorrow after his treatment.</p>

              <p>We talked to “the vet”:http://www.vcavsc.com/ this morning. Ouzo’s abdomen looks good except for one small tumor in his spleen. They’re going to try to get a sample from that and check it out. They are also going to check his lymph nodes in his neck that are a little bigger than normal. Other than that, he seems to be feeling fine and is eating well and playing with the vets. It’s only a matter of time, unfortunately. He could live days, weeks or months.</p>

<p>We’re going to get him home as soon as possible so we can spend some more time with him while we can. At least Havana got to know him.</p>

<p>Ever since Havana moved into her own room, Ouzo slept outside her bedroom as if he was guarding her. And, not realizing there was a baby monitor in our bedroom, he’d come get us if she ever cried. On the bright side, we can spoil him all we want with people food.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>In other news, Ouzo has a serious condition. For the last week or two he hadn’t been eating or would only eat a little of his food. He’s done this before over the years and we’d give him some wet food or put something more tasty on his food and a couple days later he’d be fine again. But that didn’t work this time. The night we were leaving for the hospital to deliver Hudson, Kelly noticed that he had a “growth” underneath his chin that we hadn’t noticed before.</p>

<p>Kelly took him to the vet the next morning and they decided they couldn’t figure out what it was. They took an X-ray and discovered a lot of fluid in his chest cavity. This was beyond their skills and referred us to a specialist in Seattle. Kelly then took him to <em>that</em> vet. We still haven’t heard anything from the vet.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> We talked to the vet tonight and it doesn’t look good. He has a tumor at the base of his heart and it’s inoperable. They can’t do a biopsy on it because it’s on his heart. So they’re going to do an ultrasound on Wednesday to see if there are any more tumors in his abdomen which, ironically, would be good because they could then do biopsies on those to determine if it is cancer and what kind of cancer it is. If it’s a cancer that responds to chemotherapy, we can try chemotherapy to see if that helps the tumor on his heart.</p>
