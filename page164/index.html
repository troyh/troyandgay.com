<p>“This beer”:http://www.dogfish.com/brewings/Limited_Edition_Beers/Raison_DExtra/19/index.htm was sitting in the fridge for a couple weeks, I was reluctant to try it because I generally don’t like beers with weird ingredients (I’m talking about you Belgium!) and it’s a brown ale and I have yet to find a brown ale I like. It’s also brewed with raisins and maple sugar so I assumed it’d be cloyingly sweet. But it wasn’t… it was definitely sweet, but very well-balanced. And it was especially good in today’s sun after mowing the lawn. Unfortunately, I only had one bottle to drink.</p>

<p>The most important points to me:</p>

<p>bq. You’ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle.</p>

<p>That works, my life is proof of it. :)</p>

<p>bq. No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.</p>

<p>bq. Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</p>

            <p>Belgian beer company InBev NV is “offering to buy Anheuser-Busch”:http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aNVBWD26Kq3w&amp;refer=home. I hope they do, because I would love the irony of all the ‘mericans swilling Bud Light supporting a European company, based in a country that speaks a form of French (<em>sacrebleu!</em>), and they wouldn’t even know it. SABMiller, another European company, already owns Miller beer and MolsonCoors is not entirely American anymore. So with Anheuser-Busch, the last of the big three, no longer an American company we can finally say that American beers don’t suck.</p>

<p>We left at 9:30am on Tuesday, got to the US/Canada border at noon and, after a stop in Blaine, WA for lunch, got home by 3pm.</p>

<p>We left Vancouver Sunday and drove a couple hours north to Whistler. It’s a beautiful drive through the mountains and along the water. The highway was littered with spans of construction making the highway wider for the 2010 winter Olympics.</p>

<p>The house we’re in is in the mountains surrounded by tall evergreen trees. It’s much nicer to wake up to a view of mountains and trees and the sound of light rain than the street noise in Vancouver. Havana slept a lot better too.</p>

<p>We drove up the road a mile or so to Whistler Village for lunch at the Whistler Brewhouse, another MJG restaurant and only slightly better than the Yaletown Brewery in Vancouver. Havana and the waitress sure got along well, though. We wanted to take the gondola up the mountain but it was so cloudy and rainy that the view would have been limited. We ended up just walking through the village.</p>
