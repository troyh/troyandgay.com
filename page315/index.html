          <p>Spam is not limited to email.  (Background: the way Google works is sites are rated higher in results based on the number of other sites that link into it, so it is to your advantage to have other sites link to yours.)  <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/08/001611.php">Every week</a> or <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/04/001367.php">so</a> some <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/03/001266.php">slimey site</a> will come along and post a “comment” on one of our blog entries from, oh say, MARCH with a link to their site, thereby gaining a free link to their site and better PageRank in Google.  Some folks are dealing with this using a shared <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/">BlackList</a>, and we are currently just not displaying URLs in comments.  I ran across this <a href="http://chujoe.net/archives/000182.html">hilarious account of someone’s attempt to bill a blog spammer for unauthorized advertising</a>.  I think this will be my newest strategy!</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Troy accurately characterizes our Friday afternoon problem.  Every few weeks we have to deal with one of these sorts and it really drives us nuts.  a) that we have to spend time dealing with an ass and b) that our strict commitment to allowing free speech (within reason) on our boards means that we can’t just kill them.  Imagine spending thousands of dollars and years of your life building a house and then asses move in, in eat your food and insult you, but you’re and ACLU lawyer so you let them stay.  It is beyond frustrating.  (Though I think I have become better than Troy at not letting them affect me.)</p>

<p>I’d like to make explicit a few more of the rules we’ve discovered running a community website:</p>

<p>Anyone who says “I’m leaving” isn’t; it is simply a ploy to gather sympathy.</p>

<p>Don’t feel bad when the jerks leave, because the site will flourish in their absence; and don’t celebrate too long because another will rise up to replace them.</p>

<p>Most people believe free speech should only be protected as long as it is speech they agree with.</p>

<p>Anyone who gets two warnings is incapable of seeing their errors and will inevitably get a third.</p>

<p>Less is always more.  Don’t feed the trolls.  Or as we like to say on Recipezaar: Plaid ribbons.  The more you post the more you give the jerks to quote.  Say less and the less they will have to argue with.  In fact not responding at all is usually the most effective response of all.</p>

<p>more to come…</p>

          <p>I ran the farthest I’ve ever run on Tuesday and promptly proceeded to get sick.  Friday night was the worst with the coughing and the not sleeping.  I’ve lost my voice and can’t swallow well. I coughed so hard, I threw up in the shower today, which is very, very weird.  I hate being sick most for the fact that it has cut into my training, and yesterday that I spent napping would have been great for a Fall run.  Troy has been a good nurse and I feel I am finally coming out of it.</p>

          <p>Well, Troy seems disappointed that we don’t argue enough in this blog, <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/11/001810.php#001810">this post</a> certainly worked: <em>Not only did Gay completely miss the point, she also forgot the point and refuses to get the point. Women!</em></p>

<p>Frankly, we rarely disagree on issues so it is difficult to present other perspectives on cue, and together I think we present a more rounded picture of our life and interests than each of us would individually.  More than anything he seems disappointed that I post less frequently than he does.  To me it is personal, and getting into a personal space for posting is rare.  Perhaps, we never discussed what the point of this blog is because I think we might have different visions.</p>

<p>There. We disagree.</p>

          <p>Gay found <a href="http://www.sauria.com/~jjl/blog/archives/000204.html">this</a> that mentions this site. The (not so) funny thing is that the idea behind TroyAndGay.com was that we’d both write about the same things so you’d get both our perspectives on things. But nope, Gay won’t write about anything that I’ve written about and if I mention something she also mentioned she gets angry.</p>
