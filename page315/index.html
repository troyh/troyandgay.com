          <p>Uh oh, two packages being delivered via FedEx ground this week. Why is “ground” always FedEx these days? Fortunately, they’re both shipping from California and are both scheduled to be delivered on Thursday. Thursday is when the “good FedEx driver” is working my area. I’m optimistic that the FedEx problems (<a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/10/001753.php">1</a>, <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/10/001786.php">2</a>, <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/11/001799.php">3</a>) are behind us and they’ll be back to their reliable service.</p>

<p>One package is a <a href="http://www.overclockercafe.com/Reviews/cases/X-DreamerII/">tricked-out case</a> for our new combination firewall/mail server and the other is a really nice <a href="http://www.hp.com/rnd/products/switches/switch2524-2512/summary.htm">managed switch</a> that will replace our (almost full) switch at our colocation site. I’m pretty excited about the switch. And check out <a href="http://www.hp.com/rnd/support/warranty/index.htm">the warranty</a> on it – free next-day replacement for as long as I own it. Granted, it’s a switch so there’s little that can go wrong, but it’s reassuring.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/11/001814.php#001814">Spam is annoying</a>, but the thing I love about it is that instead of getting lawyers involved, technologists are fighting back. It’s going to make the internet a less open place, but it’s far better than having more laws and bigger government, in my opinion.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.time.com/time/2003/inventions/invmusic.html">Time Magazine</a>: Other inventions this year may have more altruistic intentions (like Dean Kamen’s water purifier) or be more visible on street corners (like those ubiquitous camera cell phones). But for finally finding a middle ground between the foot-dragging record labels and the free-for-all digital pirates and for creating a bandwagon onto which its competitors immediately jumped, Apple’s iTunes Music Store is Time’s Coolest Invention of 2003.</p>

          <p>Spam is not limited to email.  (Background: the way Google works is sites are rated higher in results based on the number of other sites that link into it, so it is to your advantage to have other sites link to yours.)  <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/08/001611.php">Every week</a> or <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/04/001367.php">so</a> some <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/03/001266.php">slimey site</a> will come along and post a “comment” on one of our blog entries from, oh say, MARCH with a link to their site, thereby gaining a free link to their site and better PageRank in Google.  Some folks are dealing with this using a shared <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/">BlackList</a>, and we are currently just not displaying URLs in comments.  I ran across this <a href="http://chujoe.net/archives/000182.html">hilarious account of someone’s attempt to bill a blog spammer for unauthorized advertising</a>.  I think this will be my newest strategy!</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Troy accurately characterizes our Friday afternoon problem.  Every few weeks we have to deal with one of these sorts and it really drives us nuts.  a) that we have to spend time dealing with an ass and b) that our strict commitment to allowing free speech (within reason) on our boards means that we can’t just kill them.  Imagine spending thousands of dollars and years of your life building a house and then asses move in, in eat your food and insult you, but you’re and ACLU lawyer so you let them stay.  It is beyond frustrating.  (Though I think I have become better than Troy at not letting them affect me.)</p>

<p>I’d like to make explicit a few more of the rules we’ve discovered running a community website:</p>

<p>Anyone who says “I’m leaving” isn’t; it is simply a ploy to gather sympathy.</p>

<p>Don’t feel bad when the jerks leave, because the site will flourish in their absence; and don’t celebrate too long because another will rise up to replace them.</p>

<p>Most people believe free speech should only be protected as long as it is speech they agree with.</p>

<p>Anyone who gets two warnings is incapable of seeing their errors and will inevitably get a third.</p>

<p>Less is always more.  Don’t feed the trolls.  Or as we like to say on Recipezaar: Plaid ribbons.  The more you post the more you give the jerks to quote.  Say less and the less they will have to argue with.  In fact not responding at all is usually the most effective response of all.</p>

<p>more to come…</p>
