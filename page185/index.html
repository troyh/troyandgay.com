              <p>While on vacation, I got email from Rebekkah Denn, the food writer for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, who was doing an article on all the food sites in Seattle. I replied to her in email and “the article is online now”:http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/food/355475_foodwebs19.html. This isn’t the first time we’ve been asked this question and it amazes me how far people go to rationalize the premise that Seattle is a center for food-related online businesses. Even in her list of top 10 sites, four are in New York (About.com/food, KraftFoods.com, food.aol.com, and epicurious.com) but only two are in Seattle. Seattle, Starbucks and microbreweries had nothing to do with why we started Recipezaar. If anything, Microsoft is the reason there are online companies here.</p>

<p>Email correspondence:</p>

<p>bq. We’re on vacation in California right now, what’s the timing on your article?</p>

<p>bq. To answer your question, we think it’s just a coincidence that there are/were so many food-related sites started in Seattle. When we started, we didn’t even know about AllRecipes or Food.com and quickly learned that the makers of MasterCook software were also in Seattle. No idea why, really. I know that AllRecipes took one or two  MasterCook employees, but other than that, I don’t think there’s any relation between any of us.  I’m guessing it’s just that there are so many tech people in the area.</p>

<p>bq. Quickly, Recipezaar came about because Gay and I were bored at Microsoft and wanted to start our own business. This was in 1999. After various ideas, we decided to do a recipe site since there were tons of them around but all were pretty lousy – we felt we could build the better product. So we tried. :-)  Recipes made sense to us as a self-funded startup because 1) we didn’t need to store inventory (low startup costs), 2) recipes can’t be copyrighted so we couldn’t be sued the way Napster was at the time (low legal fees), 3) recipes are structured information that, if understood by the computer, could be made more useful to people than just text on a page and 4) it was all software, which is our only skill. We weren’t great cooks (still aren’t), as you might expect. As we always said “We just like to eat”. ;-)</p>

<p>bq. If you want to talk more, email’s fine with us if you aren’t in a hurry to write your article. We’re on vacation, so email could be sporadic for the next week or so with us. If you want to talk by phone, we can schedule some time.</p>

<p>bq. On Mar 12, 2008, at 11:28 AM, Denn, Rebekah wrote:</p>

<p>bq. Dear Troy –</p>

<p>bq. I understand you and Gay aren’t with recipezaar now, but wondered if you might share some thoughts with me on its origins. I’m working on an article for our food section at the P-I,
noting how many successful recipe and restaurant sites were founded in the Seattle area, and trying to get some idea of why. Is it just that we had so many tech people here, and were
a logical place for any website about any topic? Or was there anything else to it?  (I would have assumed the former, but I don’t see the same concentration of successful
food sites in the Bay Area, say, or New York.)</p>

<p>bq. If you have any thoughts, or if you don’t mind telling the story of how Recipezaar came about one more time, I’d love to talk. E-mail works, but if phone is easier, my cell is [removed].</p>

<p>bq. Best wishes,</p>

<p>bq. Rebekah</p>

              <p>We were planning to go home on Monday but decided to go to Los Gatos instead. After a quick stop at Starbucks, we headed south out of the city. We hit rush hour traffic so exited the highway and drove through Silicon Valley (again).</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>We found ourselves in Sunnyvale so drove by Yahoo! for old time’s sake since they’re likely to be acquired by Microsoft soon and Yahoo will surely disappear for one reason or another. We were then headed right by Apple again so we stopped in to see if we could get into the company store since we were there on the weekend when it’s closed. We could get in and found they sell the usual swag (pens, keychains, clothes, etc.), so we bought some shirts and coffee mugs.</p>

<p>We eventually made it to Los Gatos to our hotel, appropriately named “Hotel Los Gatos”:http://www.jdvhotels.com/hotels/los_gatos/. We had lunch at their Greek (!) restaurant, Deo Deka. This is the best Greek food I’ve had in many many years.</p>

<p>After lunch, we checked into the hotel and took off again for a little drive around Los Gatos and nearby Saratoga. We drove around the area some more before getting Havana to bed and room service for dinner.</p>

              <p>We spent Sunday in San Francisco. We went to “21st Amendment”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/17/21st-amendment-brewpub-review/ for lunch then drove over the Golden Gate Bridge into Marin County and over to Tiburon.</p>

<p>After our little tour of Marin, we went back into the city to our hotel. We relaxed in the hotel room until dinner time. We went downstairs to try the hotel restaurant but they were closed on Sunday. We were too tired to walk around and it was getting late for Havana’s bedtime, so we decided to get room service instead.</p>

              <p>I’d heard of “The 21st Amendment”:http://21st-amendment.com from “The Brewing Network”:http://thebrewingnetwork.com/, a 4-hour once-a-week radio show (and “podcast”:http://www.thebrewingnetwork.com/archive.php) that is what Howard Stern would be if he only talked about beer and brewing beer (and I mean that in a good way, I love Howard Stern). I’m still not sure what the affiliation is between the show and this brewpub, but there’s something that links the two. I like the show when I can spare 4 hours to listen to it so I was very curious about 21st Amendment. On our visit to San Francisco, I finally got the chance and dragged my wife and infant daughter to the place to check it out.</p>

<p>I had the IPA and the Pale Ale, both were very good. But it took a long time to get our drinks after they were ordered. How long does it take to pour a beer? We went at 1pm on a Sunday and they only had five of their beers on tap. I really wanted to try their Double Trouble Imperial IPA(India Pale Ale), “The beer to bring world peace and end the war”, so I asked the waitress if I could buy their other beers to-go and she said we <em>might</em> be able to buy some of the regular IPA but no other beers. They have a slogan on the coasters and the t-shirts: “We drink what we can. We can what we drink.”, which is an ad for their canned beers. By that, you’d think they can their beers so you can buy them. But they only can <em>one</em> of their beers! The waitress said they sell growlers but that they were “all out of growlers”. What does that mean? Do they pre-fill growlers? That’d be weird.</p>

<p>I got a little sticker-shock at the price of a beer: $5.50! At a place they brew their own beer and have no middlemen they should be able to charge less, not more. The beer is good, but not $5.50 good.</p>

<p>What about the restaurant? The food was about average and the service was below average. I ordered the onion rings with my sandwich and they “hadn’t yet made the onion rings” so I had to get fries instead. Again, this was Sunday at 1pm and they hadn’t made the onion rings yet – when were they planning to make them? The place was fairly busy, we had to wait five minutes to be seated, but the hostess spent most of the time we were there reading the paper while other people were clearing tables and our waitress had to be flagged down to get anything.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>We checked out of the hotel in Monterey Saturday morning and were on the road by 9am. We arrived in San Francisco, after a couple hours touring the area in between, at 3:30pm.</p>

<p>Our first stop was in Los Gatos, in the mountains before we reached Silicon Valley. The town was really cute so we parked, took out the stroller and walked around for a good while. They were having an Easter Egg hunt in the yard of the high school so we took Havana there where she saw chickens, bunny rabbits and ponies. We really like Los Gatos but it was still too early for lunch so we got back on the highway.</p>

<p>Next stop was Apple headquarters in Cupertino:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2335407243/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2145/2335407243_ed8f80f96e.jpg" alt="Apple Headquarters" /></a></p>

<p>And wouldn’t you know it, there’s a brewpub right next to Apple called “BJ’s Restaurant &amp; Brewhouse”:http://www.bjsbrewhouse.com/ so we went there for lunch. Gay’s getting sick of my brewpub tour, but when in Rome…. I ordered their seasonal ESB and later 4 samplers: Pale Ale, Irish Red, an Imperial Stout and their seasonal Oatmeal Stout. The ESB, pale and Imperial Stout and Oatmeal Stout were all very good. I’m usually not a fan of red ales and theirs was my least favorite of this group.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2336276130/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3260/2336276130_ed4d0bf811.jpg" alt="Beer samples at BJ's Restaurant &amp; Brewhouse, Cupertino, CA" /></a></p>

<p>I ordered a turkey club sandwich, Gay got a mini deep-dish pizza and Havana got an appetizer sampler of avocado egg rolls, a southwestern egg roll, mozzarella sticks and artichoke and spinach dip. The food was about what you’d expect at a brewpub or even a cut above most brewpubs. If I worked at Apple, I’d be at this place often (especially with their “curbside take out”:http://www.bjsbrewhouse.com/curbside.aspx). It turns out that BJ’s is a chain with locations across the country, but I’ve never heard of it since they have none in Washington (“yet”:http://www.bjsbrewhouse.com/locations.aspx). I may have to stop at the one in Eugene on the way home.</p>

<p>After lunch, back on the highway to visit Google’s headquarters and drive around Silicon Valley, through Palo Alto, around Stanford University, through Los Altos and then Mountain View. It’s kinda stupid to drive around looking for the buildings of tech companies, but I was last in the valley in 1995 or 1996, straight from Virginia, and I really liked it then. I wanted to see it again to see if it was like I remembered it was. It wasn’t. Lots of traffic and lots of strip malls. Still not Northern Virginia bad, but getting there. Living in Seattle for so long now must’ve raised my standards.</p>

<p>Enough of that, we headed north into San Francisco. We checked into the hotel, “Hotel Vitale”:http://www.hotelvitale.com/, at 3:30.</p>

<p>We had a sushi dinner at “Ozumo”:http://www.ozumo.com/. Pretty spendy, but Havana had her first sushi so it was priceless. I was probably 24 years old when I first had sushi, she’s had sushi at 42 weeks old. She’s off to a good food start.</p>
