          <p>We’re working on getting our house on the market and that required that we replace the failing windows. We’re replacing 13 of them, some worse than others, and 5 of them were done today. They would have done all of them but they mis-measured 8 of them (identical ones) so they arrived with windows that were too big. </p>

<p>The lucky new owner is going to get lots of brand new windows.</p>

        <article>
          <p>We went to the house this morning to check on progress. The cabinetry, tile and wood trim is still being installed and we saw paint samples that <a href="http://www.nbdesigngroup.net/">Nancy and My</a> had the painters do. Some more were being done when we arrived. It sounds like they’ve finalized most of the colors.

<p>We also checked on the exterior fog coat sample, this time didn’t include a bonding agent, as <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/04/08/long-friday-at-the-house/">we discussed last week</a> with Ryan, Mark and Katie. We’re trying to avoid using a bonding agent. We tried to wash it off with a garden hose and it did appear to come off a little, which implies it won’t adhere to the aggregate in the stucco. Nancy is going to try to find a color that will match or complement the grey/white color of the aggregate so when it does wash off the aggregate, it will look natural.</p>

<p>We hadn’t had lunch and were too hungry to wait for dinner so we went to <a href="http://seriouspiewestlake.com/">the new Serious Pie</a> for an appetizer and a beer – <a href="http://www.schoonerexact.com/">Schooner Exact</a>’s pale ale, which we’ve never had – while we waited for takeout pizzas. I love the new Serious Pie; it still has communal tables but it’s much bigger and in a better location, also closer to our house. It also appears more kid-friendly so I’m looking forward to taking the kids there often. Havana and Hudson even liked the egg pizza (my favorite!), which I didn’t expect.</p>

<p>On the way to the ferry, we stopped at <a href="http://www.thebeerjunction.com/">The Beer Junction</a> to re-stock the fridge with beers (and I picked up an <a href="http://www.ommegang.com/">Ommegang</a> glass), and then back home.</p>

        <article>
          <p>We’ve been working on getting our Vashon house ready to put on the market, working on the landscaping plan budget and working with the metal fabricators designing the hardware for the barn doors for the attic. I called Mark to talk about the barn door hardware design and he listed all the work that was going on at the house. Lots of stuff had been done since we were there on Friday: </p>

<p>Kitchen cabinetry installation was finished and the drawers and doors were going on, the countertops for the kids’ bathrooms was installed with their sinks, the tile on Hudson’s bathroom is almost done, Twisted Metalworks was there measuring for the office wall, the Ipê wood was delivered, the painters put all the colors on all the walls and ceiling and Nancy and My were there yesterday reviewing them and the finish carpentry was continuing. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5617042461/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5028/5617042461_8d2b9de961.jpg" alt="Ipê flooring is here!" /></a></p>

<p>It’s amazing how much progress can happen in just a few days. Plus, Mark had our electrician come out today to look at installing the security cameras that the security company will provide.</p>

        <article>
          <p>We had lots of meetings scheduled today: the landscape designer, Scot, came over to go over his budget estimate, Ryan from Superior Stucco came over to talk about the exterior stucco and two visits by security companies.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5603008485/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5064/5603008485_0ae87435ce.jpg" alt="IMG_6631" /></a></p>

<p>Since we’d be in Seattle all day, we decided to give Kelly the day off and take the kids with us and go out to dinner. They had fun playing in the house with all the people working and running around the front yard. Eventually, they got bored so it was time for the big gun: watching a movie on the iPad.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p><a href="http://www.froulaalarms.com/cms/">Froula Security</a> was first and I walked him around the house so he could bid on a security system. Because the house has exceeded a threshold in value, the insurance company requires us to put security cameras around the house during construction. I don’t get it, cameras aren’t going to stop crimes; at best, they help police find the stupid criminal who didn’t know to cover their face. Froula seems like a professional operation, unlike ADT.</p>

<p>Scot arrived and we went through the project estimate line by line so we can get an idea of how much each part costs and work on a budget.</p>

<p>We ordered pizzas for lunch from <a href="http://madpizza.com">Mad Pizza</a> for the crew and then talked with Ryan about the stucco. Schuchart/Dow went out for other bids on painting/coloring the exterior and there were dissenting opinions on what is best to do – each said they can do the right thing, of course. In the end, we decided to continue our plan to fog coat the stucco to color it but we’re not sure whether to use a bonding agent, which will decrease breathability, or not under the fog coat. Ryan will do a test without the bonding agent next week.</p>

<p>We talked with Mark and Katie about various other things and carried the paint samples they made this week around to each room. Nancy and My had been there yesterday looking at the colors and they gave us a list of rooms and their chosen colors. They are having the colors they liked painted on the walls and ceilings before a final decision is made. It’s hard for us to pick one color over another when it gets down to exact shades, so we’re relying on their eyes to pick them. This is something they’re very good at and even when we initially disagree, we later realize they’re right.</p>

<p>The ADT salesguy came over (with a very odd hat) in the afternoon to scope out camera locations and to give us an estimate. I don’t understand ADT… their salespeople are contracted out, they’re not ADT employees and don’t drive ADT cars and vans. And I got mail from the ADT guy from an aol.com address, not an adt.com address. It seems unprofessional for one of the big names in home security.</p>

<p>The Schuchart/Dow woodworkers, including a new guy Jake, were busy putting trim around the 2nd floor walls, doors and windows and are almost finished. They were also preparing the family room floor for the Ipe wood flooring that will start late next week or early the following week after it’s arrived and has been cured. Except for the master bathroom and closets, the theater and a couple pieces for the kitchen island, the cabinetry boxes is all installed. Mark from Twisted Metalworks was there again finishing up the attic brackets.</p>

<p>Once we were done at the house, we had planned to take the kids out for dinner. It was such a nice day it would have been nice to stay in the city. Hudson didn’t get a nap, though, so he was tired and wouldn’t last through a dinner at a restaurant. We decided to just go home so he could get to bed early. We made the 4:40p ferry, had a quick dinner and Hudson was asleep by 6.</p>

        <article>
          <p>My iPad 2 finally arrived. I ordered it on the Monday after the Friday it was released, when<a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/03/11/ipad-2-day/"> I didn’t get one at the local store</a>. Almost 4 weeks later, it arrived. My SmartCover arrived a couple weeks ago.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5595740383/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5109/5595740383_7538d711cd.jpg" alt="iPad 2" /></a></p>

<p>It’s quite a bit faster than the older iPad and I really like how the SmartCover props it up for typing. But why doesn’t iTunes sync the app organization?!? It took me an hour to rearrange all my installed apps.</p>
