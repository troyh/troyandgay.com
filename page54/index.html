            <div class="post-content">
              <p>The neighbor kid who was mowing our lawn hurt his foot while training for long-distance running, so had to stop mowing the lawn. I don’t mind, I like mowing the lawn so it was an excuse for me to get a new lawn mower. I ordered one from homedepot.com because they had free shipping for it and said it’d be here in 3-5 days. It ended up taking 10 days to get here and when it did, it was broken. The bolt that holds the handle was bent, preventing it from being tightened.</p>

<p>I called Home Depot and they said I could just pick a new one up at a local store, which I should have done in the first place.</p>

<p>We took it to the Home Depot in West Seattle that had the same  model and exchanged it. When we got home and opened the box, we discovered mouse poop inside right away. The box was partially opened at the store, so a mouse must’ve gotten into it. But, of course, it couldn’t get out, so it must still be inside. It turned out that there wasn’t just one mouse, but 6 mice and 2 were still alive.</p>

<p>How do we get rid of a box with two live mice in it? We can’t just throw it away and introduce mice to the house.</p>

<p>Gay called Home Depot and, to their credit, offered to come pick up the box with the mice. We left it out while <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/09/10/laurelhurst-beach-club/">we went to the Laurelhurst Beach Club</a> and by the time we got home, it was gone. Thanks Home Depot! (But you really should get rid of your mouse problem.)</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>We were going out for our Tuesday date night for dinner and then going to Eric’s movie showing, so we figured we’d have too many drinks tonight for driving, so we decided to use a taxi. While waiting for Gay to get ready, I remembered that <a href="http://www.uber.com/">Uber</a> launched in Seattle a couple weeks ago, so we decided to give it a try.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I launched their iPhone app and it showed my location on a map with the usual iPhone blue dot. It also shows the location of all the Uber cars so I saw that they have 5 cars in the city (4 in Seattle, 1 in Bellevue) right now. I set my location (the app was slightly off with my address) and it said a car could be there in 12 minutes. I hit the Request Pick-up button and a couple minutes later got an alert on my iPhone that the car would be there in 5 minutes. A few minutes later, I got another alert that the car is arriving, so I walked out the front door, looked down the street and there was a black Town Car. That was a lot easier than calling for a taxi to come to our house! Why haven’t any taxi services delivered an iPhone app to make it easier to use them?</p>

<p>He opened the door for us, we got in, he asked us where we wanted to go and we were off. He didn’t know the address so I said I’d look it up using Yelp on my iPhone, but he beat me to it using <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/aroundme/id290051590?mt=8">AroundMe</a> on his iPhone. That’s an app I need.</p>

<p>The car was very clean and the driver was very friendly. When we got to the restaurant, he pulled right up in front of the door, we just got out of the car and that was it. We didn’t have to give our credit card or calculate a tip, we just walked out of the car and into the restaurant. Very nice. A few minutes later, my iPhone beeped with acknowledgment that the ride was complete. Later, when I launched the Uber app again, it asked me to rate the driver. All in all, a very smooth operation. The total cost was $23.44, but they round down to the dollar, so the total, including tip, was $23. They emailed me a receipt as well.</p>

<p>On our way home, we took a taxi to compare the price to Uber. Being downtown, we just walked to the street and hailed a taxi right away. So that was much faster than calling for an Uber car. The taxi was what you’d expect: dirty, old and not very comfortable. The driver was friendly enough and got us home quickly. Before we could get out of the car, I had to give the driver my credit card, wait for him to run it, hand me the receipt for me to add in a tip and sign and then get out of the car. It occurred to me that he could have done all this while on the way, rather than do it all at the end. It cost us $10.75 for the trip and I gave him a $2 tip, so $12.75 total. Not nearly as easy or comfortable an operation as Uber, although if we had taken Uber home, I would have had to use the app beforehand to call for a car rather than walk out in the street and hail a taxi that are easy to find downtown.</p>

<p>I’ve never used a Town Car service, but I’ve used a limo twice in my life and both times I had to call days in advance and go through the “sign-up” process with the company. The limos came on time both times and were generally good service, but much much more expensive. Uber can sit between the taxi and Town Car markets, but eventually, both will (or should!) work on making their services as easy to use as Uber making it harder for Uber to compete between the two. The number of taxis in the city will always make them more efficient, therefore cheaper, than Uber but they won’t be as nice a car as Uber. Town Car and limo services will have to cater to even higher-end markets (weddings, big parties, etc.) or compete directly with Uber. Right now, though, Uber has set the bar for a nice and easy experience. The only problem with Uber is that you don’t know how much it will cost before you try it. That’s always an impediment to getting people to try something. They should work on setting standard pricing so you know how much it will cost before you take the trip. They could at least let you set your destination and give you a cost estimate. A cocktail or glass of champagne for the ride couldn’t hurt either.</p>

              <a class="post-link" href="/our%20life/2011/08/30/why-comcast-sucks.html">Why Comcast Sucks</a>
            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>We’ve been Comcast customers for over 10 years (Technically, we’ve been customers before that as we were AT&amp;T @Home customers that was acquired by Comcast). We recently moved and got Comcast at the new house. Because of Comcast’s “internal systems”, as their customer service people refer to it, this requires that they close the old account and open a new account. To Comcast, I’m both a new customer, who they like, and an ex-customer, who they don’t like. Because they’ve separated the accounts, they don’t realize that those two customers are really the same person. This exposes Comcast’s sucky-ness in three ways…</p>

<p><strong><!-- more -->The billing department sucks.</strong> We’ve been on their auto-payment system for years, as long as they’ve offered it. They automatically charge our credit card each month for the bill so we don’t have to deal with it and there’s no chance of a late payment. But when that account was closed and the new one was opened, the auto-payment has to be setup again. What?!? I’m the same exact person, this is stupid, just transfer it over! It gets worse… auto-payments don’t kick-in until the 2nd month. Even their billing people don’t know why this is, they just know that that is how it works and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. So our first payment at the new house was not automatically paid, so they charged us a $7.99 late fee. I called to complain that it’s not their fault they can’t keep the auto-payment in place, not my fault, so I shouldn’t have to pay for it. They agreed and refunded me the $7.99 fee.</p>

<p><strong>Their accounting department sucks.</strong> Because my old account was closed, every few days I get a call from Comcast telling me that I have Comcast equipment and that I must return it to them or they’ll charge me $100 for it. To return the cable modem, I have to drive 20 minutes north of Seattle to drop it off at their building. Because it’s so inconvenient, I put it off. It’s stupid that I have to take it to them in the first place given that their service people are driving around my neighborhood constantly. You’d think they could pick it up at my house (when they could meet their newest customer). After the second voice mail message, I called them and told them to come and get it if they want it back so badly. They set up a time to pick it up 3 weeks in the future, so I keep getting the harassing phone calls every few days and I assume I will until they finally pick it up.</p>

<p>What’s really dumb about this is that the cable modem is worthless to them. The thing is 5 years old, they’re not going to give it to another customer. And after 5 years of $100/mo internet service, I’ve more than paid off the thing to them. So threatening me with a $100 charge is simply harassment (and poor customer service).</p>

<p><strong>Their installers suck.</strong> When their installer showed up, I explained where I want the cable modem installed and showed him how easy it was to run the cable. The drop from the utility pole is behind the house, so once he took the cable from there, all he had to do was run it around the house and into a hole that was already drilled in the foundation. He didn’t have to dig a trench and put it in because I told him that we’d do that when we do the landscaping. Once in the basement, I told them he didn’t even have to secure the cable because I’d do that as I run all the cable through that room. He argued with me that he’d rather drill a hole through the foundation in the back of the house and run the cable through two walls to get it into the room where I wanted it, all so he didn’t have to run cable around the house. I asked him why he wanted to do all that when all he had to do was run it around on the ground to the front of the house. He didn’t say anything, but he must have realized my way would be easier, because the then went and did that.</p>

<p>Most business try to avoid angering customers in the first place, but Comcast’s model is to anger the customer and then work on fixing that later. How does Comcast stay in business?!</p>

<p>To put Comcast in perspective, we also have DirecTV and we had none of these problems. They didn’t close one account and re-open another account. They didn’t make me return the satellite dish or set-top boxes to them. <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/07/05/directv-dish-installation/">They installed a new dish</a> on the new house for free (although that wasn’t hassle-free). They didn’t make me setup auto-payments again or charge me a fee for missing a payment caused by their stupid system.</p>

<p>We also had Qwest DSL service at the new house during construction because the contractor needed a phone line and internet service (DSL kills those two birds with one stone). I cancelled Qwest altogether and they happily closed the account without a problem. And I still have their DSL modem that they said they’d pick up, not demand that I take it to them, but they never showed up and they haven’t yet made any threatening phone calls to me demanding that I return it. If DSL was any good, I’d drop Comcast in a second and go back to Qwest.</p>

<p>Update Sep 3: I got another call from Comcast telling me to return the cable modem or else. The person who said they’d take care of this and have the calls stop didn’t succeed (I assume didn’t try).</p>

<p>Update Sep 4: A guy in a t-shirt and jeans, not a Comcast logo to be seen, rang our doorbell and said he was here to pick up a cable modem. They weren’t scheduled to pick it up until Sep 9, but earlier is better. I gave it to him and signed the form, so everyone should be happy now. We’ll see if the calls stop.</p>
