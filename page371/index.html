            <p>So <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/text/2003/jul/17/071708371.html">who did Tenet name</a> as the White Houser responsible for the misleading uranium claim in the State of the Union Address? My money is on either Rumsfeld or Wolfowitz. Both of those guys strike me as guys who truly believe the ends justify the means.</p>

            <p>Is the availability of MP3s today preventing music from being the soundtrack to our life? <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/17/technology/circuits/17tune.html?ex=1373860800&amp;en=eae8900c59d0728a&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">Rogier Van Bakel</a> thinks so.</p>

            <p>It’s clear that the White House was so eager for war they would do anything to justify it to the American people. And it’s terrifying to think that many people think it’s okay to go off and kill thousands of innocent (non-American) people for faked reasons. I want my government to protect me from other countries who think it’s okay to kill Americans, but now my own government is one of those “whackos” that they’re protecting us from. No wonder the US is hated worldwide. But fortunately, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/17/national/17VOIC.html?ex=1373774400&amp;en=0967d1233f195953&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">people are slooowwllly starting to question our government</a>. If Clinton was put through the ringer for lying about sex, the very least we need to do is put the Bush Administration through the ringer for lying to the entire country about sending hundreds of thousands of Americans potentially to their deaths. I have faith in the American system and I’m a natural optimist, but it’s hard to not think that the American public will get bored and move on to something else.</p>

            <p>Got up early, went for a nice bike ride and then worked for a few hours. Then we had to head into Seattle to go to Bellevue to the Apple store and pick up an <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">iMac</a>. A friend bought it 1.5 years ago and it died (apparently due to a power surge one night) and it cost him $500 to fix it. So he said I could have it if I paid for the repair. Duh! That’s half-off even a used one and this one just got a brand new motherboard! He even saved the box and left the protective stickers on it.</p>

<p>We also stopped at his office. This was the first time I’ve been back to Microsoft since I left in ‘99. Microsoft is a weird place – everything looks <em>exactly</em> the same everywhere you go. The doors in all the buildings are identical, the offices, the desks, the blinds, etc. The lobbies look slightly different and there’s different artwork on the walls, but it’s so sterile and, well, bland. I felt like I never left yet I’d never been in this building before. I wonder if there’s subliminal sounds piped through the buildings (“you are happy… you like it here…. you are the smartest… you are changing the world….”). It felt better to get back in our dirty car. <img src="/img/smile.gif" alt="" /></p>

He looks like our garbage man who is also named Wayne.  UPDATED: tv news confirms this is our garbage man.  Unfortunately he was a good garbage man.</p>
