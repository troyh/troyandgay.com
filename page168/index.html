          <p>Our doorbell rang yesterday by a guy who introduced himself as “the one who bought the shit shack down the street”, referring to our beloved “neighbor house”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/02/29/pigs-house-what-150k-buys-in-the-seattle-area/. After I congratulated him on his purchase, he told me that he wanted to sell it now rather than fix it up because he doesn’t live on the island and didn’t want to do the work. He implied that the previous owner was going to buy it back from him and because “this is a nice neighborhood” and he didn’t want “that to happen again”, he’s offering the house for sale at $175K ($25K more than he paid).</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>He gave me a paper that he’s distributing to the neighborhood (bad grammar and all):</p>

<p>bq. My name is [name omitted] I am the owner of the little house at the beginning of the road [address omitted]. The house is now for sale to the people in the neighborhood. The original plan was to fix the house up and rent it out, plans changed. I have turned my focus towards other investments.</p>

<p>bq. If you are interested you can call me at [phone number omitted]</p>

<p>bq. Thanks. [name omitted]</p>

<p>He’s trying to sell me a house that he refers to as “the shit shack”. Wouldn’t “rustic cozy fixer-upper” be a more appealing description to a potential buyer?</p>

<p>His problem is that he paid $150K for property that is worth half that and he’d have to spend $50K or more to put a cute little house on it to sell it. And could he get more than $200K for it? Whatever he was thinking about property values here was clearly wrong. I feel sorry for the guy because he’s very young (20?) and now has a $150K mortgage to pay off <em>and</em> he has to pay property taxes on it.</p>

<p>I have no interest in buying it because the place is far cleaner than it used to be, so my problem is solved, and anyone who buys it is going to maintain or improve it so they can profit later. The only reason I’d buy it is so that it could return to a wooded area, which is going to happen anyway if no one buys it.</p>

<p>The previous owner can’t be stupid enough to buy it back. Or can they? They didn’t maintain the property because they got it free from her father, but once they put money into it, they have a strong incentive to maintain it. That’s my theory at least. It’ll be interesting to see what happens.</p>

          <p>We’ve watched a lot of movies lately, but unless they’re “so bad they annoy me”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/29/i-wish-there-was-no-country-for-bad-movie-makers/, I haven’t reviewed them. Catching up a little…</p>

<!-- more -->

<p><em>There Will Be Blood</em>: Very good movie and story. Daniel Day-Lewis is a great actor and very deserving of his Oscar win. Except for a couple splashes of oil on the camera lens, it was very well-made too.</p>

<p><em>Juno</em>: it started really annoyingly with the dialogue clearly intending to create as many catch-phrases as possible, but thankfully that stopped and the movie improved. It wasn’t funny, although it tried to be, but it wasn’t your typical afternoon special movie either. Ellen Page was acceptable, but didn’t deserve the Oscar nomination.</p>

<p><em>Death at a Funeral</em>: I like British humor, but not the unfunny kind. This should have been a 10-minute short.</p>

<p><em>In The Valley of Elah</em>: Probably would have been better if not a true story, it just wasn’t interesting enough. But good acting.</p>

<p><em>Bee Movie</em>: Pixar clearly did not make this movie. Dumb story – bees sue humans for selling honey and not paying the bees – and just filled with stupid bee puns.</p>

<p><em>Dan In Real Life</em>: Entertaining, but the family was so “perfect” it was implausible – what family puts on a talent show complete with costumes to entertain themselves? Only one that has Dane Cook in it, I’m sure.</p>

<p><em>Things We Lost In The Fire</em>: The screenplay should have been lost in a fire.</p>

<p><em>I Am Legend</em>: I like Will Smith and this was as entertaining as anything he’s done. Mostly just a zombie movie, though.</p>

<p><em>Michael Clayton</em>: This movie should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Tom Wilkinson was far better as a crazy guy than Javier Bardem in that lousy movie that actually did win Best Picture. The story was interesting and the pacing and timeline always kept me interested.</p>

        <article>
          <p>The Onion’s “man-on-the-street interviews”:http://www.theonion.com/content/amvo/poll_mccain_getting_even?utm_source=onion_rss_daily about McCain running close to Democrats in national polls:</p>

<p>bq. “The American people are getting harder and harder to predict when they start wanting a white man for president.”</p>

<p>Interestingly, McCain “technically isn’t a natural-born citizen”:http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23415028/, which is a requirement set in the Constitution to be President. He was born on a US military base in Panama. Congress has “a resolution up this week”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/18/us/politics/18web-hulse.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin to special-case McCain to officially consider him a natural-born citizen. Of course he’s a citizen and should be eligible to be President, but I find it interesting how “strict Constitutionalists” (read: right-wing Republicans) seem to pick and choose what the Constitution says and what it doesn’t say, similar to the way the interpret the Bible to say what they want it to say.</p>

<p>I’d be willing to bet that if Hillary or Barack were in a similar situation that the Republicans in Congress wouldn’t be questioning their eligibility – they’d certainly question their patriotism. McCain could be a “Manchurian Candidate”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manchurian_Candidate. After spending so many years in a Vietnam prison camp, we can’t be sure that he wasn’t brainwashed by the communists, can we?</p>

          <p>A friend of mine, “Adam Blum”:http://www.adamblum.com/, ran the “Boston Marathon”:http://www.bostonmarathon.org/Default.asp today in 3 hours 39 minutes, finishing 9,176 out of over 25,000 runners. Impressive! Congratulations, Adam!</p>

<p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/blog/pix/2008/04/adambostonmarathon.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I met Adam at my first job out of college in Bethesda, Maryland in 1991. He later left and went to a consultancy in Rosslyn, Virginia and eventually hired me. Years later, I went to Microsoft and moved to Seattle and soon after that, he also moved to Seattle to work for Microsoft. He’s gone on to several startups in Silicon Valley and we’ve only kept in touch loosely. He’s one of the smartest people I’ve ever worked with but in spite of that, he somehow really got into triathlons and now ultra-marathons. He does a marathon every weekend and “blogs about it”:http://coursetrained.blogspot.com/.</p>
