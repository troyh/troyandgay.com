          </h3>
            <p>It’s Gay’s second Mother’s Day. Havana and I let her sleep in a little this morning while we made breakfast. I’m taking care of Havana <em>all</em> day today, which I will be doing every 365¼ days – that kind of tireless dedication is what it takes to be a good husband and father.</p>

<p>Havana in her crib right now for her morning nap:</p>

<p>(It’s blurry because she’s learned to fiddle with the focus)</p>

<p>Havana talked to her grandparents (my parents) on Skype, which means she stares at the screen and walks around and they talk to her. Havana will always grow up with the video phones that were promised to my generation, and she won’t think anything of it. Tekmology! I’m making Gay dinner tonight… I’m making her “Pastitsio”:http://www.recipezaar.com/59733, which is the most complex thing I can make:</p>

            <p>Gay’s mom, dad and aunt came over from Spokane on Friday and we had a full house and good food for Havana’s 1st birthday party on Saturday. Havana got tons of presents too. Thanks to everyone!</p>

<p>I hardly took any photos but hopefully we can get the photos from others’ cameras and post them in “the photoset”:http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/sets/72157604879923100/. Our wedding photographer was also there taking photos, which I’m sure turned out better than mine.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Today is Havana’s first birthday. We survived the first year and, more importantly, so did she.</p>

<p>She’s had an eventful year… she’s done a lot of traveling: Hawaii in September, Oregon wine country in October, Cannon Beach, Oregon and Mexico in January, a drive to central California and back in March and a trip to Florida in April. She learned to say a few words and a little sign language, she learned to crawl, climb stairs and a few weeks ago, to walk and even stand up on her own.</p>
