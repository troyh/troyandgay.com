<p>I get monthly marketing emails from Maker’s Mark which talk about happenings at Maker’s Mark. In May, a Democratic Party in Kentucky invited Hillary Clinton to the Maker’s Mark distillery for a tour. Maker’s Mark welcomed her and they mentioned it in their monthly email. Apparently, they were bombarded with hate mail for allowing Hillary to visit. They got so much that they had to issue an apology on “their blog”:http://blog.makersmark.com:</p>

<p>bq. As you know from the email we sent out Friday, one of the presidential candidates paid us a visit over the weekend. We’ve gotten some pretty passionate emails from a few of you and wanted to make sure you knew we weren’t endorsing anyone.</p>

<p>bq. The Marion County Democratic Club invited Mrs. Clinton to Marion County and to our distillery. We extended her the same kindness we would any visiting dignitary, be it a political person or other celebrity, including Ambassadors.</p>

<p>bq. Anyway, we hope we didn’t offend anyone. We have always promised to let the Ambassadors know first about new and interesting things happening with us and the distillery. We thought letting y’all now about her visit fell into that category.</p>

<p>Commenters on the blog demonstrated their intellect:</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>bq. Don’t blame Bill [Samuels, son of the founder] and the gang; no one knew she was coming until late. Lil’ ole’ me was treated like a dignitary and I very much appreciated the MM staff’s eagerness and attention to giving me world class service (made me blush). I got better treatment than Hillary…umm…err…no one tossed tomatoes at me!</p>

<p>bq. I will add that Bill’s Bourbon aged a lot nicer than Hillary and dispel rumors that hapless bipartisan ambassadors tried dipping her in red wax.</p>

<p>bq. With Hillarys visit to Makers Mark distillery I hope we do not end up with a batch of sour mash because she has that effect on things ha ha.</p>

<p>bq. My initial thought that you invited her made me very unhappy.</p>

<p>bq. This was one of those life time trips ruined by Hillary.</p>

<p>And look how “D Morgan” shows how two-faced “southern hospitality” is:</p>

<p>bq. It wouldn’t have been right to turn her away. It’s just good Southern hospitality to treat even the worst among us with courtesy. Even when you slam someone, you do so with courtesy. For example, where I’m from, you can say the most vile thing imagineable about someone, and as long as you end it with “bless his/her heart,” then you’ve been polite.</p>

<p>I understand that bourbon is not and should not be political and that Maker’s Mark is a business, not a political tool. But I had always thought that Maker’s Mark appealed to, and was marketed to, the more intelligent and open-minded segment of society. I assumed Maker’s Mark customers were the kind of people who would appreciate that a strong, intelligent, capable and one of the greatest Americans visited the distillery, regardless of their political views. The kind of people who would not be up-in-arms if John McCain visited the distillery. But after the firestorm that Maker’s Mark received, enough to make them apologize and profess their lack of support for Hillary, I’m disappointed that their customers are just more of the same ignorant and close-minded people that reinforce America’s stereotype.</p>

<p>This doesn’t change the taste of Maker’s Mark or my appreciation of the product, but when I see it in my bar I can’t help but be reminded of what the red wax on the bottle really signifies.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> There’s “photos of the event”:http://s296.photobucket.com/albums/mm173/kmissik/. Even more interesting that this wasn’t just a drop-in, this was a real event. Even more insane that Maker’s Mark downplayed the event and apologized to their hillbilly customers.</p>

              <p>Continuing to feed my new addiction for Dogfish Head beers, I tried the limited-release “Burton Baton Imperial IPA”:http://www.dogfish.com/brewings/Occasional_Rarities/Burton_Baton/22/index.htm. Gay found this again at “Esquin”:http://www.esquin.com/ and bought me two 4-packs, since it’s only $2.99/bottle, not the $8.99/bottle ($90/gallon!) that some of their beers get.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2571256296/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3044/2571256296_21f89e634c.jpg" alt="IMG_3239.JPG" /></a></p>

<p>This one is interesting because it’s their 90 Minute IPA aged in oak casks. I don’t know how long it’s aged and they don’t say. It’s also interesting to me because it is an Imperial IPA, probably my favorite beer style. Simply put, it’s a fairly traditional Imperial IPA with a nice woody flavor to balance out the bitterness. Quite tasty.</p>

<p>The label reads: “This special ale is a two-thread blend of young and wood-aged Imperial IPA. Please share it with loved ones and hoard it from the non-believers.” I did share a sip with Gay, a loved one. But thanks to her pregnancy, a sip was all she got. It’s hard to beat a wife (no pun intended!) who finds and buys her husband exotic beers that she can’t even drink.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>After mowing the lawn and washing the car, I sat down for a “Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA”:http://www.dogfish.com/brewings/Occasional_Rarities/120_Minute_IPA/15/index.htm. I’ve had the 60 Minute and the 90 Minute, but have never found the 120 Minute until Saturday at the Thriftway in West Seattle on the way to Megan and Jon’s wedding shower. So I bought a bottle. Just one bottle because it costs $8.99 per bottle! This and Dogfish Head’s Raison D’Extra, which I didn’t realize is so pricey, are the most expensive beers I’ve ever had. It’s also the strongest beer I’ve ever had… it’s 20% alcohol! Wine is only 14-15%.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2564347385/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3184/2564347385_975967c380.jpg" alt="Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA" /></a></p>

<p>In spite of all the hops in it and the extreme dry-hopping, there was very little hop aroma. Maybe my nose was less sensitive after the the aromas of gas and cut grass from mowing the lawn, but I just couldn’t detect much at all in the beer. The flavor is a very citrus-y flavor and a bitterness (120 IBUs!) that makes the back of your tongue curl. Yum! Interestingly about the alcohol level, after drinking it I was glad that I didn’t have a Raison D’Extra because the last time I had one I could really feel the alcohol. But this beer has <em>more</em> alcohol, but felt like much less.</p>

<p>The label reads:</p>

<p>“What you have here is the holy grail for hopheads. This beer is continually hopped over a 120-minute boil and then dry-hopped every day for a month. Enjoy now or age for a decade or so.”</p>
