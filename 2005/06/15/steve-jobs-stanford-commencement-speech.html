  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Steve Jobs <a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html">spoke at Stanford’s graduation</a> last weekend. For someone who is famously private, he’s surprisingly candid about his life and career. Here’s some good advice:</p>

<blockquote>Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle.</blockquote>

<p>When I was a kid and accidentally discovered how much fun I had making software, I watched Apple become a great company (the first time) and saw Steve Jobs as a true visionary. His recent return to Apple proves it all over again. I’ve always admired his ability to get to the point in his businesses and deliver great stuff. After reading his speech, I admire his ability to do the same with life.</p>
