  <article class="post-content">
    <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/maryandlinda.jpg" alt="mary and linda" />Our neighbor Mary married us, and now she and her partner Linda (on the right) are looking to adopt.  They put up <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~marinmartinez/">their adoption website</a>, which tells all about them. Birth mothers can browse potential adoptive families, and select the one they want their babies to go to.  Things have changed greatly (and for the better) since I was adopted.</p>

<p>Mary &amp; Linda are wonderful people and fabulous neighbors.  Troy and I have had long conversations with Mary about love and marriage and family, for her to feel comfortable endorsing our own union last year, so I know a lot more about them than you do most people you share a street with and an occasional party invitation.  Any baby would be super lucky to be a part of their lives, so if you know of anyone who might not be in the right situation for a child now, I encourage you to think about them.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
