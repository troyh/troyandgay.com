  <article class="post-content">
    <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/t49635oij78.jpg" alt="bcta" />After a string of real stinkers (we’re still arguing about who put <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chasing_liberty/">Chasing Liberty</a> on our Blockbuster queue), we’ve resumed my “Alice’s” film fest by seeing <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bob_and_carol_and_ted_and_alice/">“Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice”</a> (a follow up to <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/alice_doesnt_live_here_anymore/">“Alice Doesn’t Live Here Any More”</a>).  Troy thought a wife-swapping (I say “husband-swapping”) movie was in poor taste so soon after our own wedding, but the movie less about swinging,  than the emptiness in certain truth-telling in relationships, not just Bob &amp; Carol’s but also Carol &amp; Alice’s….  The most hilarious scene is the one with Ted &amp; Alice in the bedroom trying to negotiate sex.  It would be difficult to put my finger on another movie that highlighted more clearly the difference between men and women.</p>
