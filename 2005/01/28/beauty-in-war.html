    <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/desertfox.jpg" alt="desert fox" />One of my relatives is in Iraq (I’m being vague because you really aren’t supposed to talk about where anyone in the military is or what they are doing, even though he is civilian, it seems safer).  This is a picture of a fox he spies every day on his lunch walk.  You can see the base airport in the background.  He’ll only be there for a few months, and thanks to email and digital cameras he is still quite close to home.  I’m really thankful for this picture (instead of the suicide bombing last week), because when I read the news and think of him, I can think of him on his walks, following the growth of this desert fox and her cubs. </p>
