  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I have tremendous respect for Martha Stewart for what she has accomplished as a woman in business.  <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002592161_martha30.html?syndication=rss">She has been talking more openly about her conviction and why she (rightly) chose to do the jail time in her column</a> and on her show.  Every entrepreneur goes through rough patches.  Marthaâ€™s advice is inspiring:</p>

<p>Great employees will quit; competitors will appear out of nowhere; critics will disparage you unfairly; fire will rage through your warehouse. Or perhaps your confidence will simply waver when too many little problems mount up together.  Be prepared for these occasional dark nights and remain steadfast. However bleak things may at first appear, if you are a good person doing things for the right reason, there is always something to grasp onto to help you carry on or start over.</p>
