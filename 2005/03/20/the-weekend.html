    <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/DVDPlayerScreenSnapz001.jpg" alt="" />Kathy left on Saturday morning after a productive and fun week together. We ate and cooked a lot (and took over 100 photos to prove it!). We planned to watch <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&amp;cf=info&amp;id=1808405432">The Incredibles</a>, but we only got the Extras DVD, so we watched <a href="http://www.miramax.com/quietamerican/">The Quiet American</a>, which was good, even though we all fell asleep at one point or another during it (although that was probably caused more by the wine than the movie).</p>

<p>On Saturday, after returning from the airport, we dropped the movies off at Blockbuster and they gave us the correct DVD for The Incredibles. We watched it that night and loved it! It may be my favorite <a href="http://pixar.com">Pixar</a> movie yet.</p>

<p>I spent the rainy weekend doing a lot of miscellaneous work that Iâ€™ve needed to do while Gay, who was running around for weeks without rest, relaxed and went for a 19-mile run Sunday morning.</p>
