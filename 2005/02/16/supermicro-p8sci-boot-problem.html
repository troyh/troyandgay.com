    <p>I’m posting this to help people who have the same problem I did and search for a solution can find it by searching for “Supermicro P8SCI boot problem” instead of wasting days like I did with no info….</p>

<p>We got two new identical servers last week that have the new <a href="http://www.supermicro.com/products/motherboard/P4/E7221/P8SCi.cfm">Supermicro P8SCI</a> motherboard in them. After installing linux on them, they wouldn’t reboot reliably. Roughly 70% of the boots failed – the machine just crashed right after the GRUB loading stage. This was the same on both machines, which made me believe it was a software problem rather than a hardware problem – hardware can be flakey, but two machines failing the same way is unlikely.</p>

<p>After a weekend of trial-and-error trying to figure out if the problem was GRUB or the linux kernel or a hardware problem and doing a lot of internet research, we took it to the vendor on Monday, <a href="http://siliconmechanics.com">Silicon Mechanics</a> (who is great!), and after a few hours they discovered that the BIOS console redirection was causing it. Supermicro hadn’t heard about the bug yet – it’s a new motherboard for them and I’m probably one of the few people who use the BIOS’ console redirection. We turned off console redirection and they boot fine.</p>

<p>On the bright side, we had them install <a href="http://www.intel.com/design/servers/ipmi/">IPMI</a> cards in the machines. I’ve never used IPMI, but is supposed to be a better replacement for console redirection (among other things). So maybe some good did come out of all this wasted time.</p>
