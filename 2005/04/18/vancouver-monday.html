    <p>Gay went for an hour-long run this morning along the waterfront and brought back coffee and coffee cakes for breakfast. We then went out for a walk <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=vancouver,canada&amp;ll=49.273617,-123.118662&amp;spn=0.005236,0.007596&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en">along the waterfront</a> and sat in a park right on the water with a great view of the Yaletown highrises – Yaletown is condoland!</p>

<p>Then for a long lunch at <a href="http://www.markjamesgroup.com/restbrew/yaletown/yaletown.html">Yaletown Brewery</a> where we drank beers and sat out in the sun and talked. One thing that always surprises us at Vancouver restaurants is that they never rush you out, I bet we could have sat there for hours just drinking water if we wanted.</p>

<p>We walked around a little more and happened into a wine cellar near the hotel and got a few bottles of wine to take home. We wanted the same great wine we had last night at dinner, <a href="http://www.cedarcreek.bc.ca/">Cedar Creek</a>’s Pinot Noir. And we found it and a couple others that were recommended by the salesgirl.</p>

<p>We asked why all the wines are Canadian – French and Californian wines are hard to find here. The salesgirl explained how Canada’s laws work. Get this: the store is government-run (but nice, not what you’d expect from a government operation), the government sets the prices on all the wines and does not allow stores to mark the price up at all, the government takes 67% of the cost of a bottle in tax and only allows British Columbian wines to be sold. The purpose of all this control is to foster tourism to the <a href="http://www.winesnw.com/okanagan.html">Okanagan Valley</a>, BC’s “Napa Valley”, if you will. That’s socialism for ya… you’d think if they were trying to duplicate Napa Valley’s success, they’d do what Napa did: encourage wineries, make great wines and the rest just happens. What is it about capitalism that socialists don’t get? ;)</p>

<p>Back at the hotel, my love for <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=2709">my Airport Express</a> continues…. I had the good sense to bring it along, thinking that the hotel’s non-WiFi internet would give us too short an ethernet cable. I was right, and we didn’t want to be tied to the desk in the room to use our laptops. So I plugged in the Airport Express, plugged in the short ethernet cable and voilá, we have WiFi in the room (and so do our neighbors).</p>
