This is the best photo I took while in Vancouver. It’s a shot of downtown driving north on the South Granville Bridge. I forgot to bring the camera with us everywhere we went except for this day when we spent the day with our friend, <a href="http://flee.com">Frank</a>, who now lives in Vancouver full-time.</p>

<p>In addition to C, we ate at <a href="http://www.vijs.ca/index_in.htm">Vij’s</a>, of course, for great indian food. This was my favorite meal of the trip. We also ate at <a href="http://www.vanmag.com/0409/U_diner.html">Chambar</a>, a new (~8 months) Belgian restaurant. I’m not a big fan of Belgian beers, but I did have a <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/470/1862/">Leffe</a> (or two) on draught which was very good.</p>

<p>The weather was beautiful the entire time, no rain at all. And we came home to great weather the rest of the week in Seattle.</p>
