  <div class="post-content">
    <p>We drove up to Vancouver today for a mini-vacation and to belatedly celebrate  <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=3044">Gay’s birthday</a> since we didn’t really do anything since we were so busy with work. We came to Vancouver last year for Gay’s birthday and had so much fun that we thought we’d do it again this year.</p>

<p>This time we took the “truck route” across the border through <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?oi=map&amp;q=Sumas,+WA">Sumas, Washington</a>. Friends who go to Canada often tell us this is the smart thing to do. Unfortunately, they didn’t tell us that it was smart to bring a passport when going this route, so we caught a bit of gruff from the border patrol (fortunately, I had a voter’s registration card which seemed to make them marginally happy).</p>

<p>We got to <a href="http://www.opushotel.com/">our hotel</a> at 6:30pm and went right to dinner at <a href="http://www.crestaurant.com">C</a>. A (chilly) walk along the marina back to the hotel and here we are. :)</p>
