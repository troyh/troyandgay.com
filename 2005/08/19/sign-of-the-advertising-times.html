  <article class="post-content">
    <p>For the first time, VeloNews.com <a href="http://www.velonews.com/pr/prn/articles/8724.0.html">made more money</a> from advertising on their web site than their print issue. How many offline/online publications can say that? Not many, if any. Granted, this was the Tour de France month but it’s an interesting sign of the times, I think. What they seem to have found is something I’ve never heard a print publisher hint at: that advertising on the web can grow dynamically throughout the month while print publications have to forecast interest in their issues and sell ads based on that.</p>

<p>I had always assumed that the print publishing world was doomed simply because people would demand the more timely, more dynamic online version, i.e., it’d be reader-driven. But if this is the start of a new trend, the print publishing world’s demise may be driven by the publishers, not the readers.</p>
