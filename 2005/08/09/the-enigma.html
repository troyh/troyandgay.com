    <p>Before I get to Part 2 of our <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=3103">vacation</a>, I wanted to post this before I forgot.</p>

<p>While in Monaco, it was hard to miss this yacht. It was quite impressive and after a little internet research, we found out it is the <a href="http://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/megayachts/0804top100/index4.html">31st largest yacht in the world</a>, built by <a href="http://oracle.com">Oracle</a>’s yacht-fanatic founder and CEO <a href="http://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressroom/html/ellisonl.html">Larry Ellison</a>. Note the half-court basketball court on the back.</p>

<p>Even more interesting to us was that when we were in <a href="http://www.zihua.net/">Zihuatanejo</a>, Mexico in 2000, this same boat was in the bay and we were told it was Larry Ellison’s boat (then it was, he since sold it). We were in a boat near the yacht when we noticed people playing basketball on the court and two guys, each in a dingy, waiting in the water to retrieve any basketballs that went overboard.</p>
