    <p>Hurricane Katrina <a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/12500225.htm">will hit New Orleans today</a> after killing seven people in Florida and will likely kill many more. My parents live in Florida, a place hit by several hurricanes every single year that always kill people. Youâ€™d think fewer people would die from hurricanes given the advance notice of them. Yet, in <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001443.html">2004 alone</a>, 218 people were killed from hurricanes.</p>

<p>Yet my mom fears for <em>my</em> life because I live in an earthquake-prone area. You have to go  <a href="http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/eqlists/us_deaths.html">back to 1965</a> (40 years!), to match that number of deaths from earthquakes. Between 1965 and 2005, 220 people have been killed in earthquakes in the US. And 188 (85%) were killed in just three of the largest earthquakes.</p>
