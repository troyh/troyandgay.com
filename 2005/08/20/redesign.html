    <p>It’s been a year since the last redesign, right after we were married. I’ve been sick of the design for many months but was too busy and even when not, I never sat down to do a redesign. Tonight, Gay went to a friend’s bachelorette party and I opened a bottle of wine and sat down and just did it. And there it is. Let’s see if it can last a year before I get sick of it. To lessen the chance of it getting boring quickly, I can switch out the photo easily and, assuming I have a good photo to use, I will. I hope.</p>
