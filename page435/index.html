          <p>Dedicatednet’s customers running Microsot SQL server suffered a denial of service attack from 9:30-11:30p last night, and by extension Recipezaar suffered an outage too.  Couldn’t be luckier about the timing – so late on a friday night – but scary nonetheless when we couldn’t even figure out what was going on.  Blame .</p>

          <p>Wow, <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/030122/rosen_resignation_4.html">Hilary Rosen resigned from the RIAA</a>. We know she was frustrated with the idiots at the head of the big 5 record companies who fought electronic distribution of music, but could this be the beginning of the turnaround for the RIAA? Don’t fight progress, you’ll always lose.</p>

          <p>In <a href="http://www.americanpressinstitute.org/news.cfm?id=832">The next front[ier] in the disruption of traditional media</a>, we see a journalist who realizes that journalism can largely be done by anyone. <strong>This is even more true with recipes</strong>:
_I currently subscribe to more than 20 RSS feeds on my NetNewsWire aggregator. Three come from traditional news-media companies. The rest are offered by hobbyists and niche publishers. These feeds are no less interesting, insightful or engaging than the mainstream media feeds. These self-syndicated writers have become part of my daily media habit. A Big Media Company hoping to get on my deck will start in 20th place and will need to beat out the new breed of syndicated writers. _</p>
