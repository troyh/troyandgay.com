I don’t have much to say about it, but I am love with their logo graphic and I don’t know why.  I sort of <em>get</em> that it tries to communicate the multitude of brands the conglomerate represents, but I prefer to think of it as a pixilated detail of some meaning-free photo.  I’m sure it cost at least $100k to produce, and my spirits lift contemplating the hours spent debating it within the bureaucracy – “don’t you think that red block just makes us look ‘fat’?” – but for me, it was worth it.  It is one of the prettiest things I’ve seen in a while…and yes, it probably does make me forget for an instant that they are <a href="http://www.altria.com/about_altria/01_04_02_kraftfoodsnorthamerica.asp">Marlboro &amp; Lunchables</a>.</p>

              <p>The LA Times has a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-music4mar04,1,7646945.story?coll=la%2Dhome%2Dtodays%2Dtimes">story</a> about Apple’s upcoming Mac-only music download service. I’m sure it’ll be easy to use, AAC is better than MP3 and it sounds like Apple’s smart enough to allow burning to CDs. But 99&amp;#162 for a song is outrageous, especially if I can’t listen to the song several times first. And we’ll see how big the content library is… if it’s just the big artists, forget it; we know what their music sounds like. And without the tiny labels, it’s not worthwhile to me. But again, I just don’t see how this will stop Kazaa, Gnutella et al.</p>

              <p>My replacement Apple Combo Drive arrived today! I was shocked, I just <a href="/archives/2003/02/001251.php#001251">talked to Apple on Friday</a> and today’s Monday and it arrived this morning. The drive (a Philips CDD5301, same as the old one) came well-packed in thick foam and included the relevant pages from Apple’s tech docs about how to install it. The instructions were very clear with photos and everything. Apple never ceases to amaze me with the total package they deliver.</p>

<p>I was skeptical that the new drive would work since solid state hardware rarely just dies. But I popped the new drive in, powered up, stuck a CD in and the Finder immediately popped up! <em>Woo hoo!</em> To test it, I watched the extras DVD from <em>The Godfather</em> DVD set and burned a CD with iPhoto. Worked perfectly. Now I just need to remember to send the old drive back so I’m not charged for it. And I hope this one works for longer than 10 days.</p>

<p>To send the defective drive back, all I have to do is rip off the “EZ Label” that exposes the return label, go to Airborne.com and schedule a pickup. This couldn’t have been easier. And it’s all free to me. All in all, I’m <em>very</em> impressed with Apple’s customer service. Sure beats arguing with Dell customer service. I thought I’d be without my Mac for days or weeks but I only had to turn it off for 10 minutes to replace the drive and I’m done.</p>

              <p>I ordered <a href="http://half.ebay.com/cat/buy/prod.cgi?cpid=77639&amp;domain_id=1856&amp;meta_id=1">Knuth’s Sorting and Searching</a> from <a href="http://half.ebay.com">Half.com</a> to replace my lost copy. Not a bad thing considering it only cost $20 and it’s the 1998 edition whereas my old one was the 1973 edition. One day, when I get rich, I’m gonna buy the entire Knuth Art of Computer Programming box set! This is my first purchase from Half.com so I’m a little worried about the outcome. And why doesn’t Half.com (an eBay company) accept PayPal (another eBay company) payments?!</p>

              <p>Salon is running an article on how <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/03/03/desktop_linux/index3.html">Linux desktops are just mimicking Windows</a>. Nothing terribly new in the article, just more people realizing that simply copying the Windows UI is not the secret to success against Windows. Linux desktops actually have to be better than Windows; easier-to-use and more crash-resistant. But the article is incorrect that a lower price is not going to help. Lower prices <em>always</em> helps. And eventually Linux on the desktop just may meet the “good enough” bar and coupled with a lower price, Windows is in real trouble. I think that’s the most likely scenario. I have no confidence that Microsoft will come up with something so revolutionary and innovative that they quell the <a href="/archives/2003/02/21/">Linux uprising</a>.</p>
