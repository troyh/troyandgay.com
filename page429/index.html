            <p>I just “upgraded” to Red Hat 8.0 on my dual-boot Windows machine. Linux on the desktop is still a long way away from matching Windows. Windows, of course, is about as klunky and confusing as you can get, but Linux is just trying to match it, warts and all. Gnome even uses Windows’ illogical Alt+F4 to close apps! And then it doesn’t use the Windows key to bring up the Start, ahem, Red Hat menu. Is anyone thinking? And my Palm V doesn’t work with it either, although it did work with Red Hat 7.2.</p>

<p>But the most frustrating thing was switching resolutions; Red Hat 7.2 did the “test” to make sure my monitor and video card actually worked before finalizing  the new resolution, but 8.0 just says “okey dokey” and then the next time you reboot (or logout or restart the GUI) you’re left with a resolution you can’t use. I had to reinstall to fix this. Backwards.</p>

<p>On the bright side, it includes the great file manager Nautilus that, in my opinion, is even better than the Mac’s Finder (not surprising though, since Nautilus was built by Eazel, which was founded by ex-Apple people). And “BlueCurve” is not the  ugliest thing in the world, definitely a step up from the grotesque Gnome GUI and you don’t feel like a 3-year old like you do with XP’s PlaySkool GUI. And it’s just jaw-dropping how much faster Linux is than Windows… on the same (600MHz PIII w/ 256MB RAM) machine, Windows XP chunks away at even the most trivial of tasks while everything pops up instantly on Linux.</p>

<p>I love Linux on the server, it simply can’t be beat there. But the Mac is still light years ahead of anything else on the desktop.</p>

            <p>Had take-out dinner from Express Cuisine for the first time and then watched <a href="http://www.foxsearchlight.com/onehourphoto/">One Hour Photo</a>. Why is it that Robin Williams, a “comedian”, is lousy at comedy but great in dramatic roles? From <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/movies/detail/movie/168072">Awakenings</a> to <a href="http://dontcloseyoureyes.warnerbros.com/">Insomnia</a> to this movie, he’s just great. Who takes photos on film these days, though?</p>

Po has his faults as a writer, and this book has many.  I actually feel like I have this question answered (for now), so I was really looking for the sound of others who have made “the choice” and how they knew it – I certainly didn’t at first.  Can’t say the book provides what I was looking for (or what I think most who might be asking the question) but there are a couple of good nuggets: Like how the values of the business we work become our own unconsciously, and…  </p>

<p>_“Let me describe the kind of person I was much more likely to meet.  i met people like this in droves…they’d gotten accustomed to making “very good” bank.  Filthy rich? No. But did they have enought to quit and change their life? Sure.  they wanted to. Ten times a day they’d fantasize about doin it.  But they couldn’t. Couldn’t seem to cut off that pipeline of cash.  they’d come to me because they’d heard i walkd away from money.  They want to know how I did that.  They want the golden key to unlock their golden handcuffs.  No matter how much they earned it was never quite enough to free them.  Similar to the way ethical objections [at a job] rarely triggered a change by themselves [in individuals to quit], having enough money to change rarely triggered the change by itself.  It had to get personal. Something else had to pull the trigger.</p>

<p>“Was I bent on encouraging people to change their lives? Because I’ve watched my generation stop reading book, stop reading the newspaper, stop voting in local elections? Because i’ve watched money/salary because a proxy for respect, and then a synonym for respect, an then the only kind o frespect that counts? Because i have seen us jude books we have not read, politicians we have not heard, musicians we have not listened to, politicians we have not debated, and fellow citizens we have not met? Because I have seen us torn apart by jealousy for what others our age have accoplished, rather than celebrating those accomplishments? Because I have seen us glorify those who make decisions over those who enact decisions, prefer being a consultant to being fully engaged, being an investor to being invested in, being an adviser over being politically involved, being an expert over being partisan, being a news analyst over being a news gatherer – all in fear of the inflexible boredom of commitment?</p>

<p>“[People who find their thing] are not always happy, and not always content, and not always jazzed.  it’s not a high.  it still feels like work, it’s hard, but Mondays never come too soon.  it seem like their purpose – for now.  they don’t daydream about living some other life.  Their like or dislikefor their job doesn’t hinge on what happened that day, or even that month.  they’re not always comparing their life to some other imagined life in their head.  Maybe that’s the most consistent thing they report – the mind chatter stops…“_</p>

<p>My friend Steve’s friend Bill sent out (by way of our friend Terri) this very helpful “legend” to the “what to do in case of attack” brochure at <a href="http://www.ready.gov">Ready.gov</a>.  There must be a design company somewhere that specializes in the “emergency instructions in the back of airline seats”.    </p>

            <p>Saw <a href="http://www.mulhollanddrive.com">Mulholland Drive</a> last night. David Lynch is odd. Definitely a movie that needs to be watched at least twice. I only partially understood it until I read <a href="http://dir.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2001/10/23/mulholland_drive_analysis/index.html">this</a>.</p>
