            <p>Saw <a href="http://www.orangecountymovie.com/">Orange County</a> last night. This must be one of the shortest movies ever made at 77 minutes. It was okay, somewhat funny, but always entertaining. <a href="http://www.caaien.com/jackblack/">Jack Black</a> was funny as usual. But I recommend the DVD as it has extras that are almost funnier than the movie, especially the “interstitials”. The “Advanced English” class that discusses literature in terms of Hollywood is classic Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Teacher: “Can anyone name an important figure in Romeo &amp; Juliet”
Student: “Claire Daines”
Teacher: “Claire Daines. Good.”</p>

<p>Teacher: “Today we will discuss the classics. Can anyone name a classic?”
Student: “Smells like teen spirit?”
Teacher: “Nirvana. Good classic.”</p>

<p>Sean: “I thought this class was advanced English”
Teacher: “Am I speaking French, Sean?”</p>

            <p>I finally went against the geek in me and ditched <a href="http://sendmail.org">sendmail</a> from our internal mail server and moved to the simpler <a href="http://www.postfix.org">Postfix</a>. The reason being that I simply couldn’t figure out how to configure sendmail to send mail to another server as a relay. Seems so simple and I even read the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/sendmail2/">bat book</a> to try to figure it out, but was unsuccessful. Postfix did it with one configuration setting.</p>

<p><a href="http://fetchmail.org">Fetchmail</a> still pulls down our mail from our public mail server to our internal server and it worked without a hitch with Postfix. And Postfix was amazingly easy to install, it even makes itself a replacement for sendmail by aliasing the sendmail binaries to itself. I wish I’d done this years ago!</p>

            <p>When I used Windows I loved <a href="http://www.textpad.com">TextPad</a>, because it does everything I need for writing code and html for Recipezaar.  Since I’ve been on the Mac, I’ve been looking for a replacement.  <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml">BBEdit</a> Pro does what I need – though not as elegantly as the simple TextPad – but $150 seems like a lot to pay for an editor (the free Lite version does not do syntax highlighting).  [Update: BB just canceled the free Lite version and now sells the cheaper Text Wrangler, but that doesn do syntax highlighting either.]  I thought <a href="http://www.ragesw.com/webdesign.php">Web Design</a> was the answer but despite Preferences which suggest you can set extensions for appropriate syntax highlighting, I can’t get the darn thing to open any file with an extension other than html/xml/php.  [Update: I emailed the maker and got a response in 8 hours and an offer for a private build to fix my problem – I love developers like that – I might just have my answer.]  Troy uses vi, but I know <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/02/21/vi_intro.html">this much</a> about vi, which is just good enough to get my cvs comments in and it drives me nuts.</p>

            <p>I’ve been out of the loop… Lance Armstrong and his wife <a href="http://www.lancearmstrong.com/lance/online2.nsf/html/03laka">announced a trial separation</a> on February 22. <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-dc&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns">They claim</a> this won’t affect his Tour de France.</p>

<p>They speculate that this will be a convenience to their Marketplace sellers (surprisingly “Third-party merchants were responsible for 21% of the items sold through the Amazon site in the fourth quarter”) but me thinks Amazon might have something else up its sleeve…</p>
