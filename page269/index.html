              <p>Watching football today (Redskins game via DirecTV’s Sunday Ticket) and just saw two commercials for Coors Light. In one, they argue that other beers are shipped warm but Coors Light is “always shipped cold”. Assuming it’s true that they use refrigerated trucks (doubtful), it doesn’t matter because it makes absolutely no difference in the taste of beer… in fact, it may be worse if the store doesn’t also store it cold because temperature changes are harmful to beer. It’s best to ship it at room temperature, store it at room temperature and then chill it and serve it.</p>

<p>In the other commercial, they point out that “other beers” are heat pasteurized at 140ºF while Coors Light is “brewed at 34ºF”. This is misleading because Coors Light is also heat pasteurized… almost all commercial beers are pasteurized, regardless of whether or not it is brewed at 34º. And they don’t <em>brew</em> the beer at 34º, they <em>ferment</em> it at 34º – they brew it at 200º+ like all beers, otherwise they can’t get the sugars out of the barley. But, of course, this has absolutely no effect on how “cold the beer tastes”.</p>

<p>And they end both commercials with “Because we know you like cold beer”. The sad thing is that Joe Six-Pack sees these commercials and thinks this is all logical. And Joe Six-Pack also thinks that colder is better for beer. That’s only because Joe Six-Pack has no taste… people perceive colder things to taste better (like they perceive hotter coffee to taste better) than warmer, but that doesn’t mean it tastes better than other beers. And by the way, Joe Six-Pack has a perfectly good method for getting their beer colder: a refrigerator.</p>

              <p>In 1954, the “RAND Corporation”:http://www.rand.org/ made a “model”:http://users.net1plus.com/scottm/HomeComputer.jpg of what the home computer would look like in 2004.

              <p>I never thought I’d see this in a million years, but there is at least one person at Microsoft who wants it to shrink in size (most ‘softies think bigger is better): <a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/">Mini-Microsoft</a>. He’s right, the company is <em>way</em> too big at 50,000 employees. The “mighty Microsoft” has half the employees that IBM has but only makes 1/3 the revenue. Something’s wrong.</p>

<p>And he discusses the Company Meeting, which I also learned was a much smaller affair than in previous years. When I was there, they would rent out the Kingdome and <em>all</em> employees would take the day off and go listen to Gates and the execs speak and see demos of products other groups are doing. It was a huge pep rally and, I have to admit, fun. But I always thought it was a colossal waste of money. Some people were affected by it in a positive way, but mostly, everyone was cynical about the war cries that execs put out (and the crashing of Windows during half the demos was demoralizing).</p>

<p>As an aside, in reading that I was reminded of one of the most annoying things to me when I was there: the “Microsoft-isms”. I still hear some of these today from friends. Things like “the high-order bit” (the most important thing), “Sked-plus me” (schedule a meeting with me online using Schedule+/Outlook), “action item” (something you need to do after discussing it at a meeting), “OOF” (Out Of Office, where the ‘F’ comes from I never found out) and at our wedding a friend, I think asking why I proposed to Gay after all these years, actually said “What flipped the bit?”. :) I imagine it’s like sports fans who shorten everything to one syllable… “the M’s”, “the ‘hawks” and “the Sons” are what Seattle sports fans use to refer to the Mariners, the Seahawks and the Supersonics (“Sonics” wasn’t even short enough).</p>

<p>Oh, and he references a now ex-softies’s blog: “Eighty-percent”:http://www.eightypercent.net/. That reminds me of probably the thing I hated the <em>most</em> when I was there arguing about features. PMs, when they are painted into a corner with their idea, throw their hands up and say “But 80% of all users….”  This drove me nuts. No matter what it was, 80% of all users did what this employees does, with no empirical evidence to back it up; it was just a “gut feeling”. It was wrong, of course, and it was always 80% – some PM years ago must have heard a developer talk about the “80-20 rule”:http://management.about.com/cs/generalmanagement/a/Pareto081202.htm  so they applied it to everything (albeit backwards) and other PMs thought it sounded intelligent, so it carried on.</p>

I agree, CDs are better in every way: they sound better, they don’t restrict my freedom to listen to my music wherever I want, and they’re a decent and reliable backup.</p>

              <p>I see lots of people struggling with Windows (and IE) on a daily basis. It’s sad considering they have a solution. But what’s terrible is that they just take this punishment as if “computers are just this way” or “I’m just not computer savvy”. It’s crazy. What other industry survives with such unhappy customers? When will Microsoft start paying attention? When people stop using Windows! …</p>

<p>The WSJ’s “Walt Mossberg”:http://ptech.wsj.com/ptech.html: _The single most effective way to avoid viruses and spyware is to simply chuck Windows altogether and buy an Apple Macintosh. Apple’s operating system, Mac OS X, is harder for the criminals to infect…</p>

<p>There has never been a successful virus written for Mac OS X, and there is almost no spyware that targets the Mac. Plus, the Mac is invulnerable to viruses and spyware written for Windows. Not only is it more secure, but the Mac operating system is more capable, more modern and more attractive than Windows XP, and just as stable.</p>

<p>Macs are as good as, and often better than, Windows PCs at doing the most common computing tasks: Web browsing, e-mail, word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, photos, music and video. The Mac version of Microsoft Office can handle Windows Office files with ease, and it produces files that Office for Windows handles effortlessly. Apple’s computers are also gorgeous._</p>

<p>And “David Pogue”:http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/16/technology/circuits/16stat.html echos the same in the NYT in his review of the new “iMac”:http://apple.com/imac: <em>In the long run, they’ll benefit most from the iMac’s stealth feature: Mac OS X. Not only is this operating system rock-solid and, for a first-timer, much easier to understand than Windows, so far it’s also 100 percent free from viruses, Trojan horses, spyware and all the grief that comes with them. This month, Microsoft is rolling out to the much larger Windows XP audience an 80-megabyte bundle of security patches called Service Pack 2. Mac maniacs are fond of pointing out that most of the new Windows security features were built into Mac OS X from Day One.</em></p>
