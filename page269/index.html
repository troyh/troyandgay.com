              <p><img src="http://www.americanrecordings.com/slayer/disco_reign.gif" alt="" />We’ve been watching lots of movies again recently. Nothing worth mentioning, but we saw “River’s Edge”:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091860/ last night. I hadn’t seen that movie since I was a teenager (feels like yesterday), but that movie is even better than I remembered. It must be the movie before Keanu Reeves got a lobotomy to remove all emotion. The reason I watched when I was a teenager is because it featured music by “Slayer”:http://www.americanrecordings.com/slayer/, and heavily, this was when Slayer was a nobody band, but one of my favorites (yes, I was a teenage boy once). And it was a lot of fun hearing those songs I hadn’t listened to in a lonnnng time. Anyhooo…. Crispin Glover was really good and Dennis Hopper was great, makes me wanna see “Easy Rider”:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064276/, but the uncaring of the characters to their friend’s murder and the way they all react was done better than any movie since. “The <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em> of the 80s”, the trailer said.</p>

<p>Watching “Godfather III”:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099674/ now…..</p>

              <p>Powell said the huge explosion in North Korea is “not a nuclear test”:http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;e=2&amp;u=/ap/20040912/ap_on_re_as/nkorea_explosion. That confused me, I thought for sure they’d use this to prove that North Korea is a threat. Why would they quickly work to diminish fears that would certainly help Bush’s re-election?</p>

<p>Maybe “Richard Reeves”:http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/ucrr/20040912/cm_ucrr/whatifwehadnotgoneintoiraq has the answer: <em>Among the many people quoted in the Atlantic is Jeffrey Record, a professor of strategy at the Army War College, who summed up a good deal of the thinking in Washington now: “Are we better off in basic security than before we invaded Iraq? The answer is no. An unnecessary war has consumed American Army and other ground resources, to the point where we have nothing left in the cupboard for another contingency – for instance, should the North Koreans decide that with the Americans completely absorbed in Iraq, now is the time to do something.”</em></p>

              <p>For the first time, Microsoft has stated in their SEC filing that “Linux servers outpaced Microsoft’s for the first time in terms of growth percentage.”:http://money.cnn.com/2004/09/09/technology/techinvestor/hellweg/  And, significantly, linux installations are under-reported since many linux servers are bought without an OS – we have ~20 (I’ve stopped counting) linux servers and none register as linux servers since they were all purchased without an OS and we installed the OS ourselves.</p>
