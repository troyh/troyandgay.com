            <p>We happened across the movie <a href="http://theway-themovie.com/">The Way</a> tonight on Apple TV and decided to rent it. It was pretty good. I decided that, when the kids are old enough to hike long distances and before they are too old to want to spend a summer with us, we’ll take the kids to Spain and walk at least part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Way_of_St._James">El Camino de Santiago</a> trail. It seems like a cool way to visit some towns in Spain. Documenting it here as a <a href="http://troyandgay.com/tag/promise/">promise</a> to myself.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Our street’s 26th Annual Progressive Dinner was tonight. This was our second, <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/01/29/progressive-dinner-2011/">we went last year</a> for the first time. This year, we hosted the appetizer course and Gay made a few dishes. People started arriving at 5pm and we all left to the main course down at the Farrell’s house at 7. By 9:30 or so we were at the Zorn’s for dessert and the awarding of the Garden Award, which means we got rid of it from last year! We were among the last to leave and we were home at 10:45pm. We already know most of the people but we met a couple of neighbors we hadn’t yet met. It’s a great street to live on!</p>

            <p>Boy, was I wrong about Obama and GM. <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2008/11/10/we-should-let-gm-and-ford-die/">I thought</a> giving GM a bailout was going to be a huge mistake. Not only are they surviving, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/business/gm-back-on-top-in-world-automaking.html">they’ve regained the top position</a> in number of cars sold (Volkswagen is #2?!) and all those auto industry jobs were saved. Impressive, especially considering it’s only been 2 years. We’re all still owners of GM do we still need to be paid back, but it seems possible now. Sometimes government does work.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We woke up to snow this morning after waiting Monday and Tuesday for snow that never came. There was 2” of snow already. We had gone to REI yesterday to get Eva some winter clothes and for sleds. After lunch, Gay bundled the kids up while I tied cord to their new sleds, which were bought yesterday. I pulled Havana and Eva on the long sled and Gay pulled Hudson on his own sled to the hill next to St. Joseph’s at 19th &amp; Aloha.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/6724350309/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6724350309_d24432ab54.jpg" alt="Sledding" /></a></p>

<p>A bunch of people were already there, mostly older kids. After just a few successful trips down the hill from halfway up, I took all three on the long sled. I ran down next to them with the cord to guide them. I fell, they crashed. Eva fell on her face in the snow so she had had enough. Hudson didn’t want to go again either. I took Havana down one last time. Before leaving, I ran into the Tully’s on the corner for coffees and we walked back home.</p>

            <blockquote>Long ago I was brought into this life, a little lamb
Courageous, stumbling
Fearless was my middle name
But somewhere there I lost my way

Everyone walks the same
Expecting me to step the narrow path they've laid
They claim to walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
