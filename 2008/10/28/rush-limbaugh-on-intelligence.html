    <p>Rush Limbaugh “explains”:http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_102208/content/01125113.guest.html why some conservatives don’t like Sarah Palin:</p>

<p>bq. These are the people who are embarrassed by Sarah Palin ‘cause she’s not an intellectual and she didn’t go to Harvard or have a college degree from approved universities and she drops her g’s from words like morning and says mornin’.  She’s embarrassing.</p>

<p>Rush Limbaugh and his lemmings are trying to make the argument that having an education, speaking clearly and being intelligent are now bad things. I can imagine Republican households all over the country telling their children that school isn’t important, books are evil, understanding the world around you is pointless and communicating coherently is unnecessary. That’ll make America great!</p>

<p>The new Republican Sarah Palin motto: Bein’ dum iz gude.</p>
