    <p>For the first time in a long time, we had a date tonight. We went to “Spring Hill”:http://www.springhillnorthwest.com/ in West Seattle for dinner, a place we’ve been trying to get to for months, and we were rewarded with a great dinner. I can’t remember the last time we had this good a dinner. They make a Maker’s Mark cocktail called “Gold ‘N Brown”, which is Maker’s Mark with ginger beer and charred cedar bitters – essentially a Manhattan with ginger beer instead of vermouth. I can’t say that I liked it, however. I felt I had to try it, but I’m not a fan of ginger, especially ginger beer.</p>

<p>We had raw oysters and the “beef steak hot &amp; cold” for appetizers, which was steak tartare (very good) and a small piece of ribeye steak with potato cracklings. For dinner, I had the duck breast, which came thinly-sliced and perfectly-cooked. It came with a fresh cabbage sausage and sat on a quinoa waffle, which tasted like an ordinary Belgian waffle, and mushrooms. Gay had the trout, the best fish I’ve ever had that wasn’t salmon.</p>

<p>On the way home we stopped at Metropolitan Market and picked up some gourmet goodies, like Hempler’s pepper bacon from the deli, some bratwursts, prosciutto and sandwich meat, cheese, wine and some beers I can’t get on Vashon like Fuller’s ESB, a “Full Sail’s 21st anniversary Doppelbock”:http://www.fsb21.com/ and this year’s “Jubelale”:http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/BrewPub/OnTap/5811.aspx, which is one of the best winter treats in the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>We got home at 9:45pm, which is late for us and we stayed up until midnight so we could see OJ Simpson be handcuffed and escorted to prison. It’s poetic that he was convicted 13 years to the day after his acquittal and will finally face prison for a far-lesser crime thanks to far-greater carelessness (both the crime and his defense). There are few events for which I can say “I remember where I was when…”. His acquittal was one of them and I was not happy then so I enjoyed this verdict.</p>
