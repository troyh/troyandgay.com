    <p>Andrew Sullivan “wonders”:http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/10/how-anti-intell.html about Palin’s love of education:</p>

<p>bq. Here’s one way to look at the question: how has Palin brought up her own kids? Her eldest son is a high-school drop-out. Her eldest daughter has had, so far as one can tell from press reports, very uneven attendance in high school, and no plans for college. Her other daughters seem to spend a lot of time traveling the country with their mom at tax-payers’ expense. I’ve seen them at several rallies with the Palins this fall. Are they not in school? The least one can say is that none of her children seems to have been brought up thinking that college is something to aspire to. And her new son-in-law just dropped out of high school as well.</p>

<p>It’s not surprising she doesn’t care about education, she’s dumb as a post herself and doesn’t care because lots of Americans look up to her as the poster-child for how far stupid people can go in America. But if she doesn’t care about her own kids getting an education, how much would she care about my kids getting a good education?</p>
