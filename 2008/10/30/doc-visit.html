    <p>After we went to renew my driver’s license and get a flu shot, Havana and Hudson had doctor’s appointments today; Havana had her 18-month checkup and Hudson had his 2-month checkup. They also each got a couple shots.</p>

<p>We walked down a fall-colored California Ave to <a href="http://www.igougo.com/entertainment-reviews-b18277-Seattle-Circa_Grill_and_Alehouse.html">Circa</a> for lunch, which usually has some nice beers on tap. I had <a href="http://www.bbaybrewery.com/">Boundary Bay</a>’s Harvest Ale, their Oktoberfest beer, which I liked a lot and was a nice Fall beer, and Gay had a “Grimbergen”:http://www.grimbergenbier.be/beers “Abbey Ale”, which I assume is really their Dubbel. It was good, but had a weird grape flavor to it.</p>

<p>I had a burger, Gay had a chicken sandwich and Havana had chicken tenders and fries:</p>
