  <article class="post-content">
    <p>To their credit, some McCain supporters, including a McCain campaign spokesman, ran a couple out of their rally in Woodbridge, VA who were passing out bumper stickers implying that Obama is a “socialist with ties to radical Islam”:</p>

<p>Video removed because it auto-starts which is really annoying. <a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1463341016/bctid1866657225">See it here</a>.</p>

<p>I wonder how many of these morons who claim Obama is a socialist even know what socialism is. The idiots in this video obviously don’t. They used the Communist hammer and sickle, clearly confused between communism and socialism.</p>
