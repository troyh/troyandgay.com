  <article class="post-content">
    <p>The NYT writes about “the annual Black Friday insanity”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/29/business/29black.html?_r=1&amp;hp:</p>

<p>bq. A 34-year-old Wal-Mart employee was killed, the police said, after being knocked down and trampled by a wave of shoppers who broke down the doors of the store at the Green Acres Mall in Valley Stream, N.Y. Several other shoppers were hurt, including a 28-year-old pregnant woman who was taken to the hospital, police said, after the stampede occurred just after 5 a.m.</p>

<p>In lighter news, there’s plenty of stupid people:</p>

<p>bq. “I’ve been doing this for 17 years; this year, it feels smaller,” said Tracey Darwish, 37, who was waiting in line at the Wal-Mart in Columbus to buy Madden ‘09, the football video game for PlayStation 2, for $39, marked down from $59. Ms. Darwish said that in the past she would “spend thousands of dollars on Black Friday” – even withdrawing money from her retirement account.</p>

<p>She waited in line for Wal-Mart to open to buy Madden ‘09 for $39. Yet anyone can go to Amazon and buy it “for $39.99”:http://www.amazon.com/Madden-NFL-09-Playstation-2/dp/B0012N40A0/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1227895680&amp;sr=8-2. But even dumber, she takes money out of her retirement account to buy Christmas gifts. What an idiot.</p>

<p>This woman is “cutting back” by buying an electronic corkscrew, because when times are tough and you’re unemployed, opening a bottle of wine can be unbearable with the non-electronic corkscrews:</p>

<p>bq. Rosemary O’Brien, 55, of Newport, R.I., glanced over the selection of silver-wrapped electronic corkscrews at Bloomingdale’s, retailing for $39.99. She said that she was trying to cut back after her business, Freedom Yachts, recently closed.</p>

<p>And she’s betting on not having to pay the bill:</p>

<p>bq. “I am paying a lot with credit cards, and I’m hoping the banks go out of business and I won’t have to pay them back,” Ms. O’Brien said.</p>

<p>In other words, she’s hoping that <em>all</em> banks go out of business, not just her bank. And Americans wonder why they’re all in debt and can’t get ahead.</p>
