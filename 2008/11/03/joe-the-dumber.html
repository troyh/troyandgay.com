    <p>I realize that Joe The Plumber is not named “Joe”, he’s not a plumber and he lied about planning to buy a plumbing business. That aside, it’s amazing how his ignorance about business and taxes has been bandied about by McCain as a legitimate issue. Here’s a portion of “the transcript between him and Obama”:http://www.tampabay.com/news/perspective/article858299.ece:</p>

<p>bq. Joe: I’m getting ready to buy a company that makes about $250,000 … $270-$280,000 a year.</p>

<p>bq. Obama: All right.</p>

<p>bq. Joe: Your new tax plan’s gonna tax me more, isn’t it?</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>bq. Obama: Well, here’s what’s gonna happen. If you’re a small business which you would qualify as, first of all, you’d get a 50 percent tax credit, so you get a cut on taxes for your health care costs. So you would actually get a tax cut on that front. If your revenue is above $250,000, then from $250,000 down, your taxes are gonna stay the same. It is true that for…say, from $250,000 up, from $250,000 to $300,000 or so…</p>

<p>Obama makes a good point that I think is lost on a lot of people. Most people hear that the top tax bracket is 35% and they conclude that they are paying 35% in tax. We have a progressive tax system, you only pay the tax in each bracket for the dollars you make within that bracket, not on all of your dollars. I learned this when I filed my first tax return when I was 15, why do most people still not understand this?</p>

<p>bq. Joe: Well, the reason why I ask you about the American Dream I mean, I work hard. I’m a plumber, I work 10-12 hours a day…</p>

<p>bq. Obama: Absolutely.</p>

<p>bq. Joe: …and I’m, you know, buying this company and I’m gonna continue to work that way. Now, if I buy another truck and adding something else to it and, you know, build the company, you know, I’m getting taxed more and more while fulfilling the American Dream.</p>

<p>Joe, if you buy another truck or anything else for your business, that’s a business expense. You don’t pay taxes on business expenses, you pay taxes on the profit your business earns.</p>

<p>I don’t think this hypothetical plumbing business makes $250K/year in profit. If that were true, I’m in the wrong industry! But let’s assume it’s true. If the plumbing business that you want to buy is generating $250-$280K/year in profit, you’ll be a wealthy man once you buy it, so you’ve accomplished the American Dream. Congratulations! Even if you pay a higher tax rate, so what? You’re rich. You’ll still be rich after you pay taxes.</p>

<p>If you’d prefer to no longer be wealthy and have to pay higher taxes, you have a great option that all wealthy people have: give money away until you’re not wealthy and you’ll pay lower taxes. That is, if you have no understanding of simple math, you should do that.</p>

<p>But the reality is that this hypothetical plumbing business makes $250-280K/year in <em>revenue</em>. You aren’t taxed on revenue, you’re taxed on profit. The profit is likely quite a bit less than $250K, so you’d have no tax increase at all.</p>

<p>It amazes me how the Republican Party has convinced non-wealthy people that they should feel sorry for wealthy people and their higher tax bill. Our schools really need a better math program.</p>
