    <p>We left this morning on the 11:10am ferry. After 2.5 hours, Havana was tired of sitting in the car so we stopped in “Kalama, WA”:http://www.cityofkalama.com/ to let her out to walk around. We went to the little playground in town and Havana sat on a rocker horse and watched two other kids run around the jungle jim.</p>

<p>After another three hours, we arrived in Eugene, checked into the hotel and went out to dinner at a very crowded “Steelhead Brewery”:http://www.steelheadbrewery.com/eugene.htm. After six hours in the car, barely anything to eat all day and a cranky baby, the Steelhead brewpub was perfect: we got a big table in the corner and the place was loud so Havana could make all the noise she wanted and people-watch and we could relax with beer and food.</p>

<p>One of their seasonal beers was an Imperial IPA that they call “Hoppasaurus Rex”. It was slightly fruity and deliciously hoppy and the place was so busy, I almost finished it before our appetizers came and watched Havana bounce in her highchair and watch all the activity outside the window. We had a quesadilla appetizer and for dinner I had the Bleu Burger with onion rings and their Monkey Juice Pilsner, a hoppy pilsner.</p>
