    <p>We drove to Avila Beach and then back to SLO to catch Highway 1 up the coast to Monterey. We arrived in Monterey at 4pm.</p>

<p>Our first stop on Highway 1 was the “Hearst Castle”:http://www.hearstcastle.com/ in San Simeon. They give tours of the castle, William Randolph Hearst’s house, but the tours are an hour and forty-five minutes and baby strollers are not allowed. We didn’t want to spend that much time there and I didn’t want to carry Havana around for that long either. So we didn’t take the tour. We walked through the little museum instead and Havana had some snacks outside.</p>

<p>Back in the car and up Highway 1 for a couple hours to “Carmel”:http://www.carmelcalifornia.com/. This was another curvy road, but not as bad as earlier roads and the view over the Pacific Ocean on a sunny day was worth it. We stopped in Carmel for lunch at a little Italian place. It was sunny out so we sat outside by ourselves and watched the people walk by. Havana had a grilled cheese sandwich, which was pretty tasty to me too. Gay and I had bruschetta for a starter and I had duck and goat cheese ravioli and Gay had gnocchi. Both were very good with a glass of wine.</p>

<p>We walked around the town a bit after lunch. Carmel is very quaint, one of the few towns I’d describe that way that we’ve visited on this trip. We then drove 5 miles up the road to Monterey to spend the night. We were tired and Havana went to bed early so we stayed in and ordered room service.</p>
