    <p>My highlights of 2008, in chronological order:</p>

<p>I’m not much of a car person, but “buying a Lexus LS 460”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/01/05/new-car-2008-lexus-ls-460/ was a treat. It’s still a pleasure to drive and we took it to “Cannon Beach, Oregon”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/01/11/drive-to-cannon-beach-oregon/, “California”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/19/los-gatos-to-eugene-oregon/, “Vancouver”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/18/vancouver-3/ and “Whistler”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/19/whistler/. I hope to use it to take more driving trips in 2009. We took a “trip to Mexico”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/02/01/mexico-vacation/, not in the car, which was relaxing because we spent most of the time doing nothing.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>“Havana learned to walk”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/04/16/havana-walking/, we celebrated “her 1st birthday”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/04/30/happy-birthday-havana/ and “threw her a party”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/03/havanas-1st-birthday-party/. She’s really grown-up this year and I have a lot of fun playing with her and watching her learn.</p>

<p>We took a “trip to Florida”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/04/14/florida-trip/. I didn’t (and still don’t) like Florida much at all, but it was good to see my parents, brother and sister-in-law.</p>

<p>“Getting a Kindle for Father’s Day”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/06/15/fathers-day-2008/ has encouraged me to read a lot more and I’ve done that. I read 20 or 25 books this year, which must be a record for me. I wish I had it on all the trips we took this year, it’d be great for traveling! I hope to continue to read books at a steady rate in 2009 because I’ve got quite a stack of books waiting for me.</p>

<p>“Hudson’s birth”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/25/hudsons-birth/ was one of the two biggest highlights of my life, and certainly of the year. Two years ago I didn’t have any kids and today I’m the father of <em>two</em> kids. He’s only 4 months old so he’s just starting the period where he will grow up quickly. 2009 should be a lot of fun with him and Havana.</p>

<p>We gave ourselves “4th wedding anniversary presents”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/12/anniversary-presents/ that I hope to have forever. I don’t have many keepsakes, these are precious ones.</p>

<p>“My 39th birthday”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/11/01/troys-birthday/ was my usual quiet affair, the way I like it. Hitting 39 is only a highlight because I’m not yet 40.</p>

<p>Ah, politics was big this year. Being a Hillary Clinton supporter, it wasn’t looking good for a while there, but I really enjoyed “the beginning of McCain’s implosion”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/30/mccain-proves-he-is-a-moron/ and the many shockingly stupid mistakes he made. The finale with an “Obama victory”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/11/05/obama/ will be a moment I doubt I’ll ever forget. Not since 1992 have I felt more optimistic about America.</p>

<p>Finally, my favorite holiday, “Thanksgiving”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/11/27/thanksgiving-2008/, reminded me of everything I have to be thankful for.</p>

<p>The lowlight of the year was “Ouzo dying”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/09/11/ouzo-1999-2008/, on 9/11, of all days. I miss him.</p>

<p>My beers of the year were “Deschutes’ The Abyss”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/29/deschutes-brewerys-the-abyss/, “Raison D’Extra”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/24/dogfish-head-raison-dextra/, the second of which I plan to have tonight for New Year’s Eve, and “Stone Imperial Russian Stout”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/07/03/stone-imperial-russian-stout/, which I did have two of this year.</p>

<p>Best music of the year: Coldplay’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RPTQ1C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000RPTQ1C">Viva La Vida</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000RPTQ1C" alt="" /> (say what you will, it’s a great album), Colin Meloy’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013P6TK6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013P6TK6">Colin Meloy Sings Live!</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0013P6TK6" alt="" />, Ryan Adams’ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GJ7ZMK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001GJ7ZMK">Cardinology</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001GJ7ZMK" alt="" />, Decemberists <em>Always the Bridesmaid</em> EPs, Mogwai <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CVCBLM?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001CVCBLM">Hawk Is Howling</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001CVCBLM" alt="" />, Sigur Ros <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ACY8D2?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001ACY8D2">Med Sud I Eyrum Vid Spilum Endalaust</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001ACY8D2" alt="" />.</p>

<p>Best books of the year:</p>

<p>Easily the best book I read all year was Alice Schroeder’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553805096?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0553805096">The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0553805096" alt="" />. I couldn’t put this book (the Kindle, actually) down, often staying up until 1am until I couldn’t keep my eyes open. Warren Buffett is an interesting and quirky guy with an obsession, collecting money, which almost completely destroys his personal relationships.</p>

<p>John Bogle’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470398515?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0470398515">Enough: True Measures of Money, Business, and Life</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0470398515" alt="" />, which is less repetitive than previous books and a good message for us all.</p>

<p>Tom Perkins’ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592404030?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1592404030">Valley Boy: The Education of Tom Perkins</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1592404030" alt="" />. Love him or hate him, he invented modern venture capital, which has had an enormously positive impact on the world we live in. He’s had an interesting personal life too.</p>

<p>Steven Landsburg’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416532226?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1416532226">More Sex Is Safer Sex: The Unconventional Wisdom of Economics</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1416532226" alt="" />, always a fun economics writer. I love his proof that an increasing population is good for the world and his simple argument against black-and-white thinking that seems to pervade society today: arguing for extreme solutions, rather than middle-ground solutions, is akin to concluding that, because eating less will make you lose weight and live longer, eating nothing will make you live forever.</p>

<p>The other book I couldn’t put down until I finished it was James Conaway’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618257985?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0618257985">Napa: The Story of an American Eden</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0618257985" alt="" />. Who knew the rise of Napa Valley was so colorful, political and downright fascinating?</p>

<p>Robert Mondavi’s inspiring companion to Conaway’s <em>Napa</em> (and partial attempt at modesty), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0156010569?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0156010569">Harvests of Joy: How the Good Life Became Great Business</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0156010569" alt="" />. Sadly, Robert Mondavi died this year.</p>

<p>Thomas Friedman’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374166854?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0374166854">Hot, Flat, and Crowded: Why We Need a Green Revolution–and How It Can Renew America</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0374166854" alt="" />, which I haven’t yet finished, but it’s a page-turner, even if I’m not convinced by all his points.</p>

<p>Matthew Bishop’s and Michael Green’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1596913746?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1596913746">Philanthrocapitalism: How the Rich Can Save the World</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1596913746" alt="" />, just for insight into the difficulties of effective philanthropy.</p>

<p>I (half-heartedly) recommend Eric Weiner’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/044669889X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tg0f1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=044669889X">The Geography of Bliss: One Grump’s Search for the Happiest Places in the World</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tg0f1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=044669889X" alt="" />, not because of any wisdom it gives, but because it’s an example of the futility of searching for happiness outside yourself.</p>
