  <div class="post-content">
    <p>I try to ignore politics as much as I can because after the 2004 election, I realized that most Americans are so stupid that it was too annoying to follow politics. It’s kinda like following professional wrestling – you can feel your brain turning to mush as you listen to the commentaries. But McCain’s pick for a VP is so absurd I can’t believe it happened. When I saw the headline, I thought it was a hoax that media mistakenly picked up. But it is real and we have to have this national talk about whether it makes sense or not! This is like a serious discussion about whether Homer Simpson would make a good CEO of a nuclear power plant.</p>

<p>McCain actually believes she is qualified to be the leader of the free world. He couldn’t find another Republican that he thinks is better at that job. If there was ever any doubt that he’s really really dumb, he just removed it. Americans love their dummies (and hate their smart people), so he might actually win the election. Because he might actually win, I hope McCain wakes up and she “decides” to back out of the position so he can put someone credible in the VP slot. I commend him for choosing a woman, but there are far smarter and more qualified women in the Republican party than Sarah Palin.</p>

<p>I watched the cable news channels last night to try to understand if there’s anything at all that would make this pick not the biggest mistake in political history. I found plenty of Republican mouthpieces trying hard to make the case for Sarah Palin as the VP, and even the eventual President if McCain is incapacitated, and they did it with a straight face. And I learned more about her “biography”, as the Republicans like to say. Her entire political career consists of joining the PTA, being elected to the city council and then Mayor of a podunk town in Alaska and then Governor for the last 18 months. To put the bulk of her political experience, all 6 years of it, into perspective, she was on the city council and Mayor of a town of “6,715 people”:http://www.cityofwasilla.com/index.aspx?page=49. I live on Vashon Island, which has a population of 12,000, almost twice as big, and our Mayor is a fake job that we vote on at the annual island celebration as a fundraiser ($1 per vote). Vashon Island is so small, many people in Seattle don’t even know it exists, even though it’s right next to Seattle. Sarah Palin was the mayor of a town smaller than Vashon Island and that makes her qualified to be the <em>Vice President of the United States</em>, according to John McCain and his McIdiots.</p>

<p>You’d think they’d stop there and admit that she lacks foreign policy experience but McCain makes up for it. But they don’t. The Republicans are saying that Sarah Palin has a wealth of political and foreign policy experience. Apparently, Steve Doocy, a propaganda tool (and he is a <em>tool</em>) said that because Alaska is near Russia, she has foreign policy experience. What’s the concern with Obama then? Illinois is right next to Canada, so Obama is a foreign policy expert too. Other Republicans said that being in charge of Alaska’s National Guard gives her foreign policy experience. I guess they don’t know the meaning of the word <em>national</em>. You know you can’t trust a Republican when they can’t admit that Sarah Palin is not a great VP pick. Behind the scenes, they have to be shaking their heads at how poor McCain’s judgment is. I’d rather have Dick Cheney be VP!</p>

<p>Incidentally, I remember Steve Doocy from when I lived in the Washington, DC area. He was the guy on the local news who did the “wacky” stories around town like the dog that barks at stop lights, the kid who collects bugs, etc. Now he’s someone on national TV, albeit Fox News, and people listen to what he says and believe it. Steve Doocy is a respected journalist and Sarah Palin is a VP candidate… the end is nigh!</p>
