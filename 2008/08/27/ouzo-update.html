    <p>We talked to “the vet”:http://www.vcavsc.com/ this morning. Ouzo’s abdomen looks good except for one small tumor in his spleen. They’re going to try to get a sample from that and check it out. They are also going to check his lymph nodes in his neck that are a little bigger than normal. Other than that, he seems to be feeling fine and is eating well and playing with the vets. It’s only a matter of time, unfortunately. He could live days, weeks or months.</p>

<p>We’re going to get him home as soon as possible so we can spend some more time with him while we can. At least Havana got to know him.</p>

<p>Ever since Havana moved into her own room, Ouzo slept outside her bedroom as if he was guarding her. And, not realizing there was a baby monitor in our bedroom, he’d come get us if she ever cried. On the bright side, we can spoil him all we want with people food.</p>
