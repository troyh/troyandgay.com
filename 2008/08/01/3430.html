    <p>For lunch, we went to a brewpub right around the corner from the hotel, <a href="http://www.steamplantgrill.com/">The Steam Plant Grill</a>. This was one of the coolest interiors of a restaurant I’ve been in:</p>

<p>It was the steam plant that delivered steam and electricity to downtown Spokane until 1986. They have electricity now, so I’m not sure how long they were without electricity in Spokane.</p>

<p>I got the sampling of all 9 of their beers and about 4 were good, which is a pretty good ratio. I really liked their stout.</p>

<p>Gay went to a girls lunch with a bunch of girls going to the wedding and I took Havana back to the hotel for her afternoon nap. That night, the Murphys, long-time friends of Megan’s family, had a party for all the out-of-town guests at their home. Gay’s mom, dad and aunts watched Havana and Gay and I had another date. We met Jon’s family and friends, had lots of food and wine and Jon was thrown into the pool.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Yes, Jon was thrown into the pool by his dad. Jon then threw his brother into the pool.</p>
