  <article class="post-content">
    <p>The big political news today is a New York Times story about McCain and a female lobbyist. McCain staffers from his 2000 campaign were concerned that “his relationship with a lobbyist looked suspicious”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/us/politics/21mccain.html. He and the lobbyist claim that they had no romantic relationship and that she didn’t influence him in his policies (this must be the first time a lobbyist has ever insisted that they are ineffective!).</p>

<p>History is a legitimate way to defend against accusations because with people (unlike stocks), past performance <em>is</em> an indicator of future performance. Of course, he and his supporters cite his history as a Senator to back his impartiality claims. However, they don’t cite his history as a husband to refute the romantic relationship. And for good reason, “he has had several extramarital affairs”:http://www.azcentral.com/news/specials/mccain/articles/0301mccainbio-chapter5.html.</p>
