    <p>There really is such thing as “free beer”:http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/14/when-bad-laws-create-good-outcomes-prohibition-edition/!:</p>

<p>bq. Several restaurants participated in a local food festival, serving tasty morsels in a public square. For $10, I could buy 5 “tickets” entitling me to five small plates of Philly’s finest offerings. Interestingly, only one group was offering its wares for free: the Philly brewery serving locally made beer.</p>

<p>bq. Presumably this reflects the difficulty of obtaining licensing to sell their brews. So the beer tasting was free, and instead of just enjoying one glass with dinner, I may have ended up indulging a bit more, tasting each of their varieties.</p>

<p>But it must have been lousy beer:</p>

<p>bq. A strange postscript to this event: We usually expect prices to equate supply and demand. Yet at 9 p.m., as the food festival was closing down, most of the restaurants charging $2 per plate were out of food, but the brewery still had ample supply, continuing to sell its beer at $0 a pop.</p>
