    <p>Wow. From “the LA Times”:http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-palinreligion28-2008sep28,0,3643718.story?track=rss:</p>

<p>bq. Palin told him that “dinosaurs and humans walked the Earth at the same time,” Munger said.</p>

<p>She must get her history from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_the_Lost_(1974_TV_series)">Land of the Lost</a>. Now someone <em>has</em> to ask her if the world is flat and if the Sun revolves around the Earth. Oh what the hell, ask her if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_%2B_two_%3D_five">2+2=5</a>.</p>

<p>There’s a good chance she could be President of the most powerful country in the world and she doesn’t understand simple facts. This is the person Republicans think is their second-best. Imagine who they think is third!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I’m told that this belief about dinosaurs and humans co-existing is a trap that Evangelicals have found themselves in because they made the mistake of proclaiming that the book of Genesis is literal, i.e., that God created everything in 6 days. So the fact that dinosaurs lived for hundreds of millions of years, not the 5,000 that humans have existed, has to be explained away. Dinosaurs lived for a weekend, I guess, before God decided he screwed up or that he hated them and got rid of them… by the Ice Age… without killing any humans. I wonder if they think that God created and killed dinosaurs, had humans bury them thousands of feet into the Earth so we could power our cars with it and fight over it.</p>
