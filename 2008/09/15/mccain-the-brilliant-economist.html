<p>On the worst day in the stock market since 9/11, McCain announces his idea for solving our economic problems. He explains the cause:</p>

<p>bq. the old-boy network and the corruption in Washington is directly involved and one of the causes of this financial crisis that we’re in today.</p>

<p>I wonder if McCain has forgotten that he was part of that “old-boy network and corruption in Washington” for the last 26 years. I know he hopes we all forgot.</p>

<p>So his solution is to create a “a high-level commission”:http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/16/america/NA-POL-US-Elections.php to investigate similar to the “9/11 commission”:http://www.9-11commission.gov/. We’ll ignore the fact that the Bush administration ignored all the recommendations of the 9/11 commission report, but McCain thinks bureaucrats will solve the problems that, he believes, bureaucrats created.</p>

<p>He is correct that bureaucrats created the problem. Republicans and McCain hate regulation and the housing and banking crisis we’re experiencing was caused by the de-regulation that the Republicans have wanted for years and got in the mid-1990s. “McCain supported the de-regulation”:http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=s1999-105 that caused it! In fact, <strong>38 of the 39 Democrats in Congress voted against it and all 44 Republicans voted for it</strong>. This was a problem clearly created by Republicans, as McCain correctly pointed out.</p>

<p>Now, McCain’s own economic advisor has a solution:</p>

<p>bq. a McCain economics and policy adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said any plan should include regulation of all sorts of financial institutions, consumer protections, improved corporate governance and “systems stability” programs.</p>

<p>In other words, we just need to undo McCain’s mistake. Yet McCain  thinks we need a commission to spend several years thinking about it. Republicans have no understanding of economics beyond cutting taxes.</p>
