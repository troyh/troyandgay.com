    <p>A friend of mine, “Adam Blum”:http://www.adamblum.com/, ran the “Boston Marathon”:http://www.bostonmarathon.org/Default.asp today in 3 hours 39 minutes, finishing 9,176 out of over 25,000 runners. Impressive! Congratulations, Adam!</p>

<p>I met Adam at my first job out of college in Bethesda, Maryland in 1991. He later left and went to a consultancy in Rosslyn, Virginia and eventually hired me. Years later, I went to Microsoft and moved to Seattle and soon after that, he also moved to Seattle to work for Microsoft. He’s gone on to several startups in Silicon Valley and we’ve only kept in touch loosely. He’s one of the smartest people I’ve ever worked with but in spite of that, he somehow really got into triathlons and now ultra-marathons. He does a marathon every weekend and “blogs about it”:http://coursetrained.blogspot.com/.</p>
