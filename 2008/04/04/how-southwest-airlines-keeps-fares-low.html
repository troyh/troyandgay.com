    <p>Southwest Airlines pays people to get the FAA to avoid safety inspections on their planes and passes the savings on to their customers. I dislike government regulation because corporations being regulated quickly learn to schmooze regulators and regulators, being government employees, have no incentive to do a good job due to small and rare pay raises and job promotions, are easy prey. But given that a failure in an airplane causes many deaths, the FAA is a regulatory agency that I like. That is, until I hear that “the FAA works with the airlines and against safety”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/04/business/04plane.html?ex=1365048000&amp;en=3d8a1a9e7465655d&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss.</p>

<p>The safety guy in the FAA, Nicholas Sabatini, brushes off safety problems with progress made by the airlines and the manufacturers:</p>

<p>bq. Mr. Sabatini repeatedly cited statistics showing progress in aviation safety, saying the rate of fatal accidents had dropped by more than 60 percent in the 10 years ended Sept. 30, 2007.</p>

<p>He’s happy with 40% as many fatalities as a decade ago and thinks that’s an excuse to ignore safety concerns. I wonder if the rate would have dropped by more than 60% if he had been doing his job. He should be fired, but he won’t be:</p>

<p>bq. One committee member, Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Texas Democrat, asked Mr. Sabatini if the manager who had told Southwest to keep flying was still being paid. “Yes, ma’am,” he replied.</p>

<p>bq. “What do you have to do to get fired, then?” she asked.</p>

<p>Bush should be awarding several FAA officials medals of honor any day now.</p>
