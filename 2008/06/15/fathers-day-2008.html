    <p>Technically, this is my second Father’s Day but Havana was only 6 weeks old at the time. This feels like my first one and I was looking forward to it. And the weather was great, all weekend was beautiful. Gay and Havana woke me up and Havana had put her “I Love Daddy” shirt in honor of Father’s Day and gave me a bag of gifts. I got three books to read to Havana and an “Amazon Kindle”:http://amazon.com/kindle! I spent the day in the hammock in the sun reading on the Kindle and finished the afternoon with a “Lagunitas IPA”:http://www.lagunitas.com/beers/ipa.html, one of my favorite IPAs.</p>

<p>The Kindle is a great device. I agree with a lot of the reviews that mention its design flaws. The screen is easy to read and can be read in direct sunlight. It’s light enough to hold for long periods of time and can hold lots of books, 200 supposedly. That alone makes it an improvement over books. All in all, I highly recommend it.</p>

<p>For dinner, we had barbecued <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/menu/18525">Rib Eye steaks with chimchurri sauce, garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed corn</a></p>

<p>The wine was a 2005 “PlumpJack”:http://www.plumpjackwinery.com/plumpjackwinery/ Cabernet that we got “while in Napa Valley”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/13/napa-valley/. For dessert, we had a homemade strawberry shortcakes with whipped cream while watching “Talk To Me”:http://movies.nytimes.com/2007/07/13/movies/13talk.html.</p>
