    <p>Continuing to feed my new addiction for Dogfish Head beers, I tried the limited-release “Burton Baton Imperial IPA”:http://www.dogfish.com/brewings/Occasional_Rarities/Burton_Baton/22/index.htm. Gay found this again at “Esquin”:http://www.esquin.com/ and bought me two 4-packs, since it’s only $2.99/bottle, not the $8.99/bottle ($90/gallon!) that some of their beers get.</p>

<p>This one is interesting because it’s their 90 Minute IPA aged in oak casks. I don’t know how long it’s aged and they don’t say. It’s also interesting to me because it is an Imperial IPA, probably my favorite beer style. Simply put, it’s a fairly traditional Imperial IPA with a nice woody flavor to balance out the bitterness. Quite tasty.</p>

<p>The label reads: “This special ale is a two-thread blend of young and wood-aged Imperial IPA. Please share it with loved ones and hoard it from the non-believers.” I did share a sip with Gay, a loved one. But thanks to her pregnancy, a sip was all she got. It’s hard to beat a wife (no pun intended!) who finds and buys her husband exotic beers that she can’t even drink.</p>
