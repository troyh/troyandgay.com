          <p>Just saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/">The Matrix: Reloaded</a> and as <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/05/001413.php">I suspected</a>, it sucked. I don’t want to spend any more time on this review than I have to after wasting 2 hours having to sit through the movie. There is no programmer in the world that can watch this and not cringe at the ridiculousness of it; maybe some could suspend disbelief and overlook that, but I certainly couldn’t. “Writing the program”, “hacking”, “program hacking the program”, etc. are all overused &amp; misused throughout the movie. And would you believe this line is in the movie?!: “You don’t know a person until you fight them”.</p>

<p>It’s apparent that the plot for the series was contrived after the surprising success of the first movie – there’s just no coherence to it at all from the first movie. Oh, but wait, maybe that’s the whole idea, you just don’t know what is real and what is not. And guess what? I really don’t care what’s real and what’s not. Stupid, stupid, stupid. And the fighting scenes…. same ‘ol, same ‘ol. I’m sick of seeing the robotic karate and the float-and-kick®. Do something new! And egads, the love story … for crying out loud, that’s bad enough, but the complete lack of  human emotions in Keanu Reaves makes it painful to watch. And you could see that Superman-saving-Lois-Lane stunt at the end 500 miles away.</p>

<p>The coolest scene was the <a href="http://www.mgm.com/title_title.do?title_star=RONIN">Ronin</a>-rip-off car chase. And this was so obvious, they turn up all of a sudden in a parking garage, where you can just see “Upcoming Car-Chase” written all over the screen. But even this was filled with stupidity. For one, the bad guy jumps out of his car onto the hood of another car and crushes it and flips it before jumping to the good guys’ car. The people in this movie routinely jump hundreds of feet at a time, but in this case, he decided not to jump onto the good guys’ car first and end the chase right there. But when he did jump on their car, he just landed on it softly, he didn’t crush it or do any damage at all. And the bad guys repeatedly took over other people in the cars around them just by morphing them into the bad guy. But they always chose the drivers in cars behind the car they were chasing. Why not the car in <em>front</em> of the car they’re chasing?!</p>

          <p>What’s the difference between flipping a coin and playing in the World Series? Flipping a coin 7 times takes just seconds, is more exciting, requires some amount of skill and you’re left with something of value when it’s over. <img src="/img/smile.gif" alt="" /></p>

          <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/alicia-01.jpg" alt="alicia-01.jpg" />Karen and her daughter, <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/alicia.html">Alicia</a>, arrived last night. We’ve been working with Karen all day (she gets up <em>very</em> early) and Alicia’s been playing with the dog, watching TV, browsing the web, and hopefully not getting too bored. Karen’s as nice as we expected, and even more down-to-earth than we expected. Alicia is an adorable girl who is the friendliest and well-adjusted “almost 14 year old” girl I know. What’s striking is the relationship Karen &amp; Alicia have (and they’d probably be embarrassed if they read this)… Alicia clearly loves her mom and they are simply good friends joking with each other all the time. Maybe I shouldn’t be so terrified of having a teenager?</p>

          <p>The FedEx delivery came back this morning and I talked to them (actually a woman). She said she didn’t realize that the doorbell was a doorbell. It’s a button, and the only button, next to the door. What else would it be?</p>

<p>And I still don’t understand why my signature-on-file indicating my authorization to leave packages at the doorstep applies to FedEx Express but not to FedEx Ground. Why does the transportation type determine whether I want packages left at my doorstep?</p>

<p>It’s a shame that it took just as long to travel the 600 miles from Sacramento to Seattle as it did to travel the 5 miles from Seattle to our house. But I got my package.</p>

          <p>Hmmm…. it seems that the US military is a <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/story.jsp?story=452375">bunch</a> of <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/story.jsp?story=452375">jerks</a>. Reminds me of the recent PBS <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/truth/">Frontline</a> that showed the military crushing an Iraqi’s car because he was looting. It turned out that he was a taxi driver and he was carrying wood on top of it, presumably to rebuild his war-damaged house. But the GIs sure had a ball  destroying his car and playing it up to the camera while he watched.</p>
