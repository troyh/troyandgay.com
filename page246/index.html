        <article>
          <p>We’re still recovering from the trip back, both health-wise and sleep-wise. We can’t get on a regular sleep cycle, which is why I’m wide awake at 1am. And we’ve both been going through sickness, due to the rapid change in climate and/or the recirculating air on 20+ hours of airplanes. But we’ve had a productive week of work this week in spite of this, which feels good.</p>

<p>In spite of the drastic climate change, I’m happy to be in the Northwest Fall weather. The leaves have completely turned and mostly fallen and it’s alternating cloudiness and sun. For the first time in 5  years I’m looking forward to my birthday this year. And, as always, I’m looking forward to the holidays.</p>

          <p>“CNN”:http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/19/robertson.bush.iraq/index.html: <em>The founder of the U.S. Christian Coalition said Tuesday he told President George W. Bush before the invasion of Iraq that he should prepare Americans for the likelihood of casualties, but the president told him, “We’re not going to have any casualties.”</em></p>

<p><em>Update:</em> The White House is “denying”:http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/19/robertson.bush.iraq/index.html Bush ever said it and Pat Robertson stood by his statement. Pat Robertson has said  (and continues to say) some pretty odd things, but someone’s lying. You can usually tell by asking yourself: Who has more to gain from lying?</p>

          <p>They’re <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002064801_oilspill16m.html">close to catching</a> the people who spilled the oil all over south Puget Sound and Vashon. One of the two suspects “has a history of pollution incidents”. A few lawsuits will make the corporation be more careful next time.</p>
