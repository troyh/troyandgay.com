              <p>The electricians finished up the bulk of the work. They’ll return for one day after the drywall is done and painted to put the jacks and plates on.</p>

<p>Tomorrow the drywall will go up, tape and mud applied the next day and probably Friday too. By the end of Monday, the windows should be framed. Then the walls can be primed and painted, which we will do ourselves to save about $1500 (!). Then, the floor and it’s all done.</p>

              <p>“Slate critiques”:http://slate.msn.com/id/2109282/ those annoying AOL ads on TV. The one with the woman who is so concerned about her child’s safety on the internet hands her baby to a stranger so she can make her case to the AOL execs. And the one where the crowd of AOL customers storm AOL headquarters to give feedback instead of using email. Slate humorously points out the other flaws in the commercials. With ill-conceived commercials like this, no wonder they are “losing subscribers fast”:http://www.theregister.com/2004/11/03/aol_q3_04/ and “laying off 700 people”:http://www.clickz.com/news/article.php/3430221.</p>

              <p>An eBay-sponsored “study”:http://www.clickz.com/news/article.php/3432801 on online communities shows that people like them. That’s not surprising since that’s what the internet is about. And it also shows that the most popular communities are personal interest and hobby communities. Not surprising either, at least to us. What is interesting is that the communities where a huge percentage of investment is going related to online communities, dating services and business-networking services, are the least popular online communities.</p>

              <p>The electricians came today to begin wiring all the outlets, ceiling fan box, ethernet jacks and phone jacks. The new electrical outlets are being run directly from the fuse box so we have “clean power” (that’s good, they tell us) for all the computers in the office. And we’ll have eight of ‘em for each of us! And 8 ethernet jacks each! It’ll be nice to have shorter wires running around the office. They’re installing in-wall space heaters too since the office is not connected to the house’s HVAC system.</p>

<p>After the electricians are done (tomorrow?), they can frame the windows, do the drywall work and replace the trim they had to remove.</p>

<p>We’re in the process of picking out paint colors for the walls and trim. So far, the plan is white walls and slightly off-white/greyish trim. And we’ve almost decided on the bamboo flooring, just nailing down the color there too, which is going to be some shade of dark brown.</p>

<p>When the windows went in, Gay was out of town for the weekend at her alma mater, “Whitman College”:http://www.whitman.edu/content/, in “Walla Walla”:http://www.wwchamber.com/ with the Vashon high school debate team in a debate tournament. I was worried that she would think the windows were too dark since they’re a shade darker than all the other windows in the house. And they’re far more reflective on the outside than the existing windows. But she had no problem with them at all. We always had a glare problem on our monitors with the old windows, so these should eliminate that and we may not even need blinds. Whew! I was thinking how we’d tell Ron that he has to take them out and send the windows back to have them redone – they’re custom windows and took forever to get made. And as a bonus, Gay brought home four bottles of wine from Walla Walla (the Napa valley of Washington).</p>

              <p>We spent most of the day in a photo shoot at our house for an article to be published later this month in a national magazine, assuming we make the cut and make the article. Photos were taken outside with the dogs, in the kitchen with a fish and at my desk with a computer. Illy, of course, never left our side but Ouzo freaked-out every time the lamps flashed and soon took off for good. Being photographed is not as easy as it looks… what do you do when you’re told “Talk about something” or “Look like you just heard good news” or “Interact with the dog”. Appearing natural feels unnatural.</p>

<p>We were interviewed a couple weeks ago and they liked what the writer wrote (so it can’t possibly be accurate). Unfortunately, the article is not about “Recipezaar”:http://www.recipezaar.com, per se, but I won’t betray their confidence and say what the article is about – and we’ve heard a few different variations of it so we’re not entirely sure anyway. :)</p>
