              <p>We left Troy’s parent’s house for New York Monday.  We checked into the very cool Hudson hotel with very small rooms.  We upgrade and started to bar hop our way downtown.  We saw an empty Ground Zero at night.  I still can’t believe it happened…seeing the site made Troy angry at the perpetrators.  We met Cindy and Peter at Les Halles (Tony Bourdain’s restaurant) for steak and then went to some bar to see Cindy’s “boyfriend” DJ – bah!  Tuesday we slept in, walked all around SoHo, ate the most awesome pizza at Pomodoros in Little Italy (meatball pizza), and stopped for a beer at a corner bar.  We had a great dinner at DeNiro’s Tribeca Grill, and a very expensive nightcap at the hotel’s Light bar which has an amazing atmosphere and design.  Wednesday we had bagels and loxs for brunch and walked down through Times Square.  We spent hours shopping at ABC carpet and home, buying 4 different leather chairs and two cow hide rugs.  We had Indian food for dinner and then had a LONG cold walk back to the hotel (our bar-hopping luck was running out).  Thursday we awoke to the biggest snow storm on the East Coast.  We managed to have an amazing lunch at Iron Chef Japan’s Nobu restaurant, and then a drudgery walk through the snow around SoHo, Chinatown and Little Italy before stopping in a corner bar to warm up.  We managed to take the subway to the airport (long), trusting that our flight would not be delayed more than an hour.  We boarded only an hour late, but spent another hour and a half on the plane waiting for 1 guy to transfer from another flight (of course, seated in the third seat in our row), de-icing the plane, and then just in line to take off.  The delayed caused us to miss the last ferry by ~15 minutes, so we spent 2 1/2 hours sleeping in the Seattle airport, and then cabbing to the dock to take the 5a ferry home.</p>

              <p>We left early Thanksgiving morning for Florida.  Car &gt; Ferry &gt; Shuttle &gt; Subway &gt; Airplane &gt; Monorail &gt; Car we arrived at Troy’s parents house 3,000 miles away 12 hours later. We had Thanksgiving dinner with Troy’s mom, dad, aunt Lorna, brother and sister-in-law on Friday. Saturday we took a driving tour of the area (deftly avoiding the mall), bought a digital camera and then experienced the best of Ocalla dining and entertainment.  “The Villages” is a fully manufactured Southwest style shopping center and square.  With free entertainment every night in the square and 2-for-1 drinks, who’s complaining?  That night we continued the party til 3a…  Sunday we just hung around the house and watched football.</p>

              <p>Last night, a little after 9pm, tokyo went bonkers. The cache updating combined with heavy traffic brought the SQL server to it’s knees. I couldn’t even get an ssh login! An hour later, I called Aaron at CoLo to reset the machine. After 11pm, he was there and reset it. But it didn’t work; the machine just refused to boot. By midnight, we came to the conclusion that we would have to go into Seattle and try to fix the machine ourselves. This is the day before our expected biggest day ever, btw.</p>

<p>By 1:15am, we packed our stuff up, burned CDs with a database backup and a MySQL installation. We took the 1:30am ferry into Seattle and headed to the Westin building. About 5 minutes before we arrived, my cell phone notified me that tokyo was OK! We got to the machine and found it was just fine (although the clock was off by an hour since the hardware clock is not as smart as the software clock wrt Daylight Savings Time).</p>

<p>We went back to the Fauntleroy dock and waited til 5:30am when the first ferry took us back to Vashon.</p>

<p>We need some backup/redundancy plan.</p>
