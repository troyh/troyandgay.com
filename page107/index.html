          <p>We got back to London at noon and got into our apartment by 2pm. For dinner, we walked down to our old neighborhood (<a href="http://www.mayfair-london.co.uk/shepherd_market.htm">Shepherd’s Market</a>) to order Indian take-away, took that home, ate it, gave the kids a bath and put them to bed.</p>

          <p>The two best things about Brussels: the train ride in and the train ride out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3603393647/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3592/3603393647_44fe169016.jpg" alt="IMG_0893" /></a></p>

<p>I had high hopes for Brussels, but the food is mediocre, not very French at all like we expected. I’m sick of french fries, they serve them with <em>everything</em>. But what happened to the Belgian custom of mayo for the fries? The really good beers (Chimay, Duvel, etc.) can be bought in America, the rest are good but not good enough to write home blog about. The city is deteriorating, dirty, graffiti-filled and is under construction almost everywhere you go (did I miss a recent war in Belgium?). Their streets change names every block or so and the names are so long they don’t fit legibly on maps. Their milk sucks, Havana went on a milk strike and she’d drink milk all day if we let her. It’s more expensive than even London.</p>

<p>On the positive side, the people are friendly, the waffles are very good (they’re snacks, not breakfast choices) and a few square blocks of the city has beautiful old buildings.</p>

<p>I suppose it also follows that drinking sparkling (carbonated) water is better than still water after exercise.</p>

        <article>
          <p>We walked to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Place">Grand Place</a> and found (possibly the only) brewpub in Brussels, <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/3443/?view=beerfly">Les Brasseurs</a>, right off the square with a great view so we went there for lunch. The beer was pretty good. I had the Tripel and Gay had the Dark. The Dark was very nice and sweet. But they were also very expensive at €7.50 and €9 each. That’s $10.63 and and $12.76 for a 16 oz (500ml) beer! Even in London, where beers are served in Imperial pints (20 fl oz), I don’t recall paying nearly that much. That’s what you pay for drinking beer overlooking the biggest tourist spot in Belgium. The food wasn’t all that great either. I’ll never complain about $4.50 beers in the US again.</p>

<p>After lunch, we went to a couple hotels we found online to see if they had a room that would work for us with 2 kids. We usually try to get suites that have a room separate from the beds so we can put the kids to bed early and we can stay up later. That’s hard to find here, but we ended up getting two adjoining rooms instead, which we now realize is even better. Two rooms always seemed excessive with just one kid, but with two, two rooms seems to work well. Plus, you get two of everything: two showers, two bathrooms, two breakfasts, two TVs, etc. They also gave us the second room for half-off. We have the impression that tourism isn’t so great these days and both hotels we visited were very willing to negotiate prices – there’s an upside to a global recession (thanks AIG and Bear Sterns)!</p>

<p>The hotel is more expensive than the apartment but the location is much better, just a few blocks from the Grand Place, a park and all the recommended restaurants. Unless you’re in love with money, we think it’s always better to trade a little more money for a better quality experience.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>We took the car from Bovey Castle to the train station in Exeter, took the train to London’s Paddington Station then a taxi to St. Pancras station. We were at this station in 2005 to take the train to Paris but it’s been completely redone since then. An hour later, we boarded the Eurostar train to Brussels. This was a great ride. Our car was almost empty, there was just a group of 4 business people and a few other people in the car, so Hudson’s cries about his teeth didn’t bother anyone.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3593726012/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3558/3593726012_fbf898367e.jpg" alt="Folding tables are fun" /></a></p>

<p>The food was pretty good too. I had the moussaka and Gay had the salmon. And wine, of course. Havana had a kid’s meal of chicken. I even found the latest Economist to read so I have one less issue to catch up on when I get home (why isn’t the Economist on the Kindle?!?).</p>

<p>We arrived in Brussels and took a taxi to the apartment we rented. Actually, we took it to the office to get the keys to the apartment, then to an ATM to get cash for the taxi and then to the apartment. We went out to get groceries for the kids, walked around the neighborhood and finally found <a href="http://www.lesbrassins.com/">Les Brassins</a>, which Gay had found online as a good place to go. The staff was very friendly, they gave us a table in the corner of the very crowded restaurant even though we didn’t have reservations. And the waitress was very polite with us on our first attempt in years to try to speak French.</p>

<p>The restaurant didn’t take credit cards (something surprisingly common in Brussels) so we were careful to stay within the limited cash we got from the cash machine. They have <a href="http://www.lesbrassins.com/en/bieres">lots of beers</a> but only two on tap, Taras Boulbas (?), and a wit beer. I got the first one and Gay got the other. Both were good and we were glad to be back in a land of carbonated beer. Gay got the spaghetti bollainaise, which everyone in the place seemed to have ordered so it was a safe bet that it was good. I thought I ordered the duck special but ended up with beef carpacchio, which we think was intended as an appetizer. Since we were limited on cash and because the kids were tired and Hudson was complaining about his teeth we figured we should eat and go as soon as we could. So I didn’t attempt a re-order of the duck. It was also very good and a big enough appetizer that I was content to order a second beer and enjoy that.</p>

<p>After dinner we returned to our apartment. We were disappointed in our apartment – Gay had found it online but the pictures didn’t match the reality. And although the neighborhood is billed as the hip place to be with great shopping, we didn’t find it that appealing (I never find shopping appealing) and it was 1.5 miles from the city center. After our experience walking in London, we realized that the kids can only take so much walking/strolling before getting very bored. So we decided we’d see if we could find a better hotel closer to the city center. After the kids went to bed, we got online and searched for a hotel.</p>
