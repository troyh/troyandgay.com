            <div class="post-content">
              <p>After almost 3 months with Miller-Hull it became clear to us that we needed an architect with more creativity. We’ve worked with enough (graphic) designers in our careers to know that some designers just can’t get outside of their design comfort zone, so we decided to switch to a different architect. Miller-Hull’s a great firm, but just not the firm for us.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>If creativity is what we now realized is what we need, we knew <a href="http://www.oskaarchitects.com/About/Leadership/TomKundig">Tom Kundig</a> was the person. We initially thought he was “too creative”, if that’s possible, but now realize that it’d be much easier to work with a creative designer in than it is to get a non-creative designer to be creative. In retrospect, we should have hired Tom from the start. Gay has always loved his architecture and wanted to hire him from the beginning and he does mostly residential projects rather than commercial and public projects, but we somehow talked ourselves into Miller-Hull. Tom’s won quite a few (50+) architecture awards including 27 AIA awards and <a href="http://www.oskaarchitects.com/">his firm</a> is the 2009 AIA Firm of the Year.</p>

<p>We intentionally gave Tom only the same information we gave to Miller-Hull: a “program”, in architect-speak. Ours is a 59-page document we wrote describing the requirements of the house, i.e., which rooms we want, their general size, number of bathrooms, etc. as well as some visual cues from architecture that we’d collected over the years. A program is a useful exercise to go through for the clients because it forces you to think about the details of the house and your lifestyle. For example, do we want the kitchen to be close or far from the dining room? Do we want the kids’ rooms to be close or far from the master bedroom? Do we want to enter the house from the front door or come in through the garage?</p>

<p>We didn’t give him any clues about our experience with Miller-Hull and we didn’t verbalize anything about what we were expecting in the house. We wanted to see if he came up with different designs than Miller-Hull based on the same information that they were given.</p>

<p>Today we had our first meeting with Tom and Dan, another architect Tom works with, and it was immediately obvious that they get it. I wasn’t even expecting drawings, I thought we were going to just talk and wave our hands at vague ideas. But he came with four general designs of houses, each one was unique and each one was clearly trying to get at various parts of our program (he seemed to have actually read it!) and the feel for the house and the property. We want the house to embrace the Seattle weather rather than just be a shelter from it and to take advantage of both the water/mountain view that we have but also the views of the big Douglas Firs and the wooded part of the property. This was a struggle to explain to Miller-Hull but Tom clearly understands this from the start. We had a good talk about what we like and don’t like about the designs and I feel like we’re much closer already to the layout of the house than we were after 3 months with Miller-Hull. I may be overly-optimistic, but I wouldn’t be surprised if we had the layout of the house all but nailed down a month from now.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>One of the things that annoys me about the NFL is how they measure for first downs. You can usually tell if the ball is placed far enough for a first down without “bringing out the sticks”, as they like to say, to measure it. That’s why they have yard markers across the field. Are those two poles joined by a chain just so manly that the NFL can’t get rid of them? Are the guys who have this job part of a union that the NFL can’t fight? You’d think by now we’d have a more accurate (and quicker) way to measure, maybe with a $1.50 laser from the sideline?</p>

<p>In last night’s Monday Night Football game, we have a demonstration of referees who were unable to determine if the ball was past the first down marker without “bringing out the sticks”. Was this really necessary?:</p>

<p>The dumbest thing about measuring this way is that there is no regard for the placement of the other “stick” that is used to base the measurement on. The way it works is a guy takes “the stick” from the sideline and runs 20 or 30 yards to where the measurement is going to take place and it is assumed that this guy can perfectly place “the stick” using just his eye to locate the spot from the sideline. This guy isn’t off by even an inch?!? If this guy is so accurate at judging distance and spots on the field, why not just ask <em>him</em> if the ball is far enough for a first down? Instead they relegate him to the supposed unimportant part of the measurement.</p>

<p>Then the other “stick” is lifted, pulled tight and dramatically put down so we can all see if it’s a first down or not. It’s assumed that the second “stick” is brought down perfectly parallel to the sideline. If it’s not, the measurement can easily be off by several inches – 7th graders taking geometry know this.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the stupidity of having “inches to go” for a first down. Watch the Center when he grabs the ball to hike it to the quarterback… he almost always moves it back or forward an inch or two and that’s perfectly legal, so who cares if the play ends up an inch or two short of the first down? Just call it a first down and move on. We don’t need the charade of “bringing out the sticks”.</p>

              <p>The AP Mobile iPhone app has a cool feature to alert you for important breaking news. Unfortunately, they generally use it for <em>unimportant</em> news. At 4:46am Pacific Time, the AP decided I needed to know that the Olympic Committee approved golf as an event in the 2016 Olympics. In other words, the AP thinks I can’t wait even a couple hours until I wake up to find this out. Even if I was a golfer hoping to enter the Olympics in golf in 7 years and I’d been hoping this day would come all my life, I could have waited until I woke up to learn about this news.</p>
