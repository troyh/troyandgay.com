          </h3>
            <p>He’s had a rough 8th month. He’s been sick twice and had a bad cold this week (that he got from mom and passed on to me and then to Kelly) which made it hard for him to breathe with his thumb in his mouth. That made it hard for him to sleep at night so we had a few sleep-deprived nights this week. The bulb syringe was used frequently to unblock his nose – it’s amazing how much stuff can come out of such a tiny nose.</p>

<p>He’s babbling a lot more than he used to and seems to be trying hard to talk. Still nowhere near walking and doesn’t try crawling very much even though he doesn’t like to stay in the same place or position for long. He’s becoming a very picky eater too, one day he’ll love something and the next he will refuse to eat it. He’s starting to eat solids but that’s hit and miss too.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We had an appointment today on Bainbridge Island so we drove up and had lunch at the marina. It’s been years since I’ve been to Bainbridge and it’s still a cute as ever. I wish Vashon had a downtown area as nice as Bainbridge’s but with half the population of Bainbridge, I don’t think Vashon can sustain it.</p>

<p>Our appointment ran longer than expected so we just missed the ferry from Bainbridge to Seattle so we raced back down the peninsula and were the last car on the Southworth ferry back to Vashon. Phew!</p>

          </h3>
            <p>I’ve had these beers over the last few days:</p>

<p>Dogfish Head Aprihop: rating=3/5, didn’t think I’d like it, but I did.
Great Divide Hercules Double IPA: rating=4/5
Skagit River Trumpeter Imperial Stout: rating=4/5
Port Brewing’s The Lost Abbey Angel’s Share: rating=4/5
Stone Cali-Belgique: rating=3/5
Fuller’s London Porter: rating=4/5</p>

<p>I hadn’t had London Porter in many years and it’s hard to find, so when I found it, I picked up two (cans). It’s just as I remember it, very malty, somewhat bitter and nicely sweet.</p>

<p>Angel’s Share is another big-hyped beer lately and I’ve been waiting to find it. It just arrived in Seattle this week so when I found it I had to get it. On Saturday we finally got Quantum of Solace from Netflix so we shared it while watching the movie, which seemed like a great night. Both the movie and the beer were disappointing. I can’t get over the complete lack of carbonation in the beer, although otherwise it’s wonderful.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>She’s getting tall enough to ride her tricycle, but her legs are just a tad too short to reach the pedal at its furthest point. She can now turn the pedals several turns but if she doesn’t give enough push on the downward stroke the pedal doesn’t get all the way around. And she doesn’t quite have the hang of turning the wheel to steer yet.</p>

<p>She sings a song that goes “Pedals and wheels, pedals and wheels” as she rides it. I don’t know if that’s a made-up song or something she heard somewhere.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Today is the first sunny day, so Havana got to hunt for Easter eggs today instead of on Sunday.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3445247177/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3648/3445247177_16104d6996.jpg" alt="IMG_3580" /></a></p>

<p>When she woke up from her noon nap, Kelly told her that the Easter bunny came and she asked “Did he hide the eggs?” How does she know that?</p>

<p>She found all the eggs and immediately opened each plastic one as she found them to get the Jelly Belly inside.</p>
