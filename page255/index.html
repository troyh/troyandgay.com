              <p>Watching CNN in Indonesia… one of the most important things they talk about is the price of oil. It’s barely a news story in the US, but CNN Asia &amp; CNN Europe can’t get enough of it. I’ve never heard the terms “Sweet and sour” or “Light” referring to oil – they talk about the different types of oil all the time, and I’m not sure why.</p>

<p>The other big story here is the US elections…. just goes to show that the US is <em>not</em> an island and what happens in the US does affect the rest of the world.</p>

              <p>Today’s the last day of our honeymoon. We’re going to see about shipping stuff home, have a massage (my first ever!) and then have a “romantic dinner for two” (hotel’s words) on the beach tonight for the last dinner of our vacation. Then all day traveling tomorrow and, hopefully, be back at home late Saturday night. :)</p>

              <p>We did more shopping this morning and found some nice furniture but have to figure out if and how to ship it home. I imagine it’ll be convenient since we live in Seattle, one of the largest ports on the west coast.</p>

<p>We’ve finally discovered the luxury of taxis. Taxis couldn’t be easier to get in Bali, you can’t walk 5 feet without a taxi honking at you asking if you want a ride. And they’re cheap: we have yet to pay more than 70¢ for a ride across Seminyak. Not a huge distance, but it would take an hour to walk the same distance and an hour of our time is worth the 70¢, I think. Taxis even have the <a href="http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2850">offerings</a> on the dash. :)</p>

<p>CDs, DVDs and even software can be purchased at the local grocery store for good prices. For example, we found Photoshop CS for 25,000 Rupias, less than $3! A pirated copy, of course, but a good one – you have to look closely at the packaging to realize it’s a photocopy. Unfortunately, they had no Mac versions. ;)</p>

<p>Upon returning to the hotel room yesterday, we found a note on the door inviting us for cocktails tonight  on the terrace of the hotel. So we went. There were just a few couples there and we were immediately greeted by staff and given Mai Tais. And a staff member made small talk with us and we told her how long we were here and where we’d been in Bali. We must have mentioned some red flags, because 15 minutes or so after we were done talking to her, another staff member came out to ask us specifically about The Four Seasons and our villa in Ubud and how The Oberoi compares. I was impressed to see the competitiveness. :)</p>

<p>We planned to have dinner at another highly-recommended restaurant, La Lucciola, but we hadn’t made reservations, something the Oberoi staff said was required. So they made the reservation for us. Unfortunately, we couldn’t get in til 9pm, which is past our bedtime. We went over at 7:30 anyway and by 8pm we were seated. This is a very nice restaurant right on the beach. I had beef tenderloin on polenta which was excellent. Gay had pasta with veal, also very good.</p>

<p>Rather than take the street home, we decided to walk along the beach back to the hotel. The waves were very big and got us pretty wet at times, but it was nice to be alone on the beach for a short walk. One thing I will miss about Bali is the temperature outside at night. The humidity seems to diminish and the temperature feels about 75ºF, which is pretty perfect.</p>

              <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2068.jpg" alt="IMG_2068.jpg" />We went out walking around Seminyak. Pictured is a temple near our hotel. This time I wore a cotton t-shirt and it made all the difference… 3 hours walking in the hot, humid weather and I was much better. It’s best to listen to Gay when she says “Are you really going to wear that thick linen shirt?”. ;)

We did some shopping and stopped at a swanky bar/club for a light lunch (satays and spring rolls) and beers. The picture shows the view from our table overlooking the “lawn” and pool. Then more and more and more shopping, walking around half the town of Seminyak.</p>

<p>We stopped and had dinner at the highly-recommended Mykonos, very good Greek food for Bali. Then back to the hotel for some wine by the pool. :)

One thing I have to point out is the state of sidewalks in Bali. The pictured sidewalk is very common here and makes walking around town difficult (which I doubt the taxi drivers mind). If you look into the hole in the sidewalk, you’ll see running water. I don’t know if it’s there irrigation system for the rice paddies or what, but I have seen people dipping buckets into the water (I hope not to cook with!). But at least there are sidewalks… some streets have no sidewalk or even a shoulder, which makes walking less fun.</p>

              <p>I think we just had an earthquake here in Bali.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: It’s <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/SP276054.htm">confirmed</a>, a 5.0 quake hit right near us off the coast. We talked with a couple locals about it and they did feel it too but thought nothing of it since minor quakes hit Bali often. And living in Seattle, quakes are fairly uneventful unless they hit 6.0 (10x more powerful than a 5.0) or more.</p>
