The population of the US is over 11 times that of Iraq, so a lot of statistics would have to be multiplied by that number.</p>

<p>Thus, violence killed 300 Iraqis last week, the equivalent proportionately of 3,300 Americans. What if 3,300 Americans had died in car bombings, grenade and rocket attacks, machine gun spray, and aerial bombardment in the last week? That is a number greater than the deaths on September 11, and if America were Iraq, it would be an ongoing, weekly or monthly toll.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,65039,00.html">Wired News: Hack Attack Gums Up Authorize.Net</a>. It finally made the mainstream news… I was beginning to wonder if Authorize.Net was telling the whole truth. We use Authorize.Net to charge credit cards, so this affects us. I don’t understand why they can’t simply provide a different IP address instead of using DNS until this problem goes away.</p>

          <p><img src="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/ABPub/2004/09/17/2002038805.jpg" alt="" />The “Seattle Times”:http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002040554_btinterface20.html features “Recipezaar”:http://www.recipezaar.com in their Tech “Interface” section. Much better than the “Red Herring article”:http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2789 and the Seattle Times understands that you <em>link</em> to web site you are talking about in an online article. The photo was taken at our colocation facility in downtown Seattle – the machines behind us are the servers that run the site.</p>

<p>Tomorrow morning we’ll have to head to the newsstand and buy several copies. I don’t think I’ve been in a newspaper since I was a kid playing soccer and was mentioned in the paragraph blurb about the game.</p>
