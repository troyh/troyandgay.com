          </h3>
            <p>Our local newspaper, <a href="http://www.vashonbeachcomber.com/">The Beachcomber</a>, ran the story about the delivery of a chair we had shipped recently:</p>

<p><em>A taxi wanting to cross from Point Defiance to Tahlequah at 9:15 a.m. last Thursday was detained by Washington State Ferries.
The cab’s trunk was open, and the occupants appeared to be of Middle Eastern descent.
WSF called the police because ferry personnel are not allowed to look inside vehicles, according to WSF spokesperson Susan Harris.
She said that the police found that there was a chair in the trunk.
“In these heightened times,” Harris said, “we have potential security problems. It turned out to be no big thing.” The taxi was allowed on the boat.</em></p>

<p>The delivery people refuse to drive their truck on the ferries, so they find creative ways to get our chairs to us. What they don’t tell you is that the taxi wasn’t the only car detained, they held the ferry for 45 minutes so all the people were detained waiting for the police to arrive.</p>

<p><em>Sarcasm Mode on…</em></p>

<p>Gotta hand it to that crack team at the WSF, though. They can spot those open trunks, and they know the 100s of closed trucks and 1000s of closed trunks that ride the ferries daily certainly do not have bombs in them.</p>

<p>And of course, terrorists are trying desperately to blow up the Tahlequah ferry. Not the larger and more trafficked Fauntleroy-Vashon ferry or the even bigger Bainbridge ferries. Terrorists correctly see the tiny Tahlequah-Tacoma ferry as the linchpin to the American psyche.</p>

<p><em>…Sarcasm Mode off.</em></p>

            <p>Acccording to MSNBC, Ali Hassan Majid (“Chemical Ali”), Saddam’s cousin, has just been confirmed dead by the British military in Basra. This guy was <a href="http://www.hrw.org/press/2003/01/iraq0117.htm">vicious</a>.</p>

<p>It’s 12:30am and I’m going to sleep. The reports are that they are moving very rapidly through Baghdad at this point. I just may wake up and find that Baghdad has fallen.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We did lots of behind-the-scenes work on <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> that was at times very frustrating. I’m a software person, so hardware problems are less fun to deal with. But I’m smarter for it (theoretically).</p>

<p>The weather has been great in Seattle, it feels like summer has come early. Today is dreary and sprinkling, but almost all week has been great. Last weekend we did lots of yardwork and I finally got a chance to vacuum the driveway to get all the pine needles and other tree debris off of it. But today it looks dirty again. :(</p>

<p>Of course, we’re watching the war. I’m amazed at how poor CNN’s coverage has been. In fact, it’s so bad, I’ve been watching MSNBC (gasp!). In the last 2 weeks, the war started and almost finished. But listening to the US media, you’d think we were in Vietnam for a few days there. Today they’re in Baghdad and they’re almost to the point where they’ve got Saddam on the run.</p>

<p>The scariest thing to me about this war is not the number of deaths or even the anti-US after-effects that are likely. What concerns me the most about this war is how the American people (that I’ve interacted with) have reacted to it. I don’t know who first said “violence begets violence” but they were right – Americans are <em>extremely</em> violent in their attitudes with each other. And the worst thing of all to me is that I have heard many (too many!) times that anyone who disagrees with this war is “un-American” or “un-Patriotic”! Do these people even understand what this country stands for?! This country was founded on the principle that we can publicly disagree with our government and today we have people telling people <em>not</em> to disagree. You’d think we were living under someone like Saddam Hussein. If our government’s actions cannot withstand words of criticism, then maybe, just maybe, they’re not the correct actions.</p>

<p>I’m an American and I love this country with all its faults. It does many things wrong, but it does far more things almost perfectly. But I especially love the fact that we are free to criticize our leaders without fear of retribution from them. Unfortunately, we don’t appear to be free from retribution from each other.</p>

<p>I wish Bush had tried a little harder to go the peaceful route and I think he was a little to eager to start a war and for many wrong reasons (and some right ones). I seriously doubt the outcome would be any different, but it was worth a shot to try to resolve this peacefully. The only other alternative would have been to let Saddam be and that would have been worse for the world in general, in my opinion. It seems clear now that Saddam did support terrorism, including Al-Qaeda, and it remains to be seen whether or not he did have chemical/bio weapons (I think he does). But we’re already hearing more stories about atrocities he has committed on his own people and I’m sure that’s just the beginning.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>My (geeky) excitement is that I bought two <a href="http://valinux.com">VA Linux</a> machines on <a href="http://ebay.com">eBay</a>. I’ve always wanted a VA Linux server; they’re well-built machines and they are/were the “Dell of Linux”. But now that they’ve gotten out of the hardware biz, I think it’s cool that I own a piece of Wall Street history from the great dot-com bubble – VA Linux was the <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/log/1999/12/10/va_linux/">biggest IPO</a> in stock market history surging 698% the first day and it’ll likely be a decade or more before that record is broken.</p>

<p>By today’s standards, these machines are fairly low-powered (about 1/3 the speed of the other servers that run Recipezaar). But they were also very inexpensive and more than enough for their intended use.</p>
