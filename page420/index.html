          <p>Spent the greater part of yesterday working on our business taxes – due March 15.  The government actually made it easier on small business this year by not requiring a lot of accounting rigamaroll.  It still cracks me up when they have to list the estimated amount of time it takes to fill out the forms and do recording keeping for them as part of the Paperwork Reduction Act – would you like a receipt for your reciept?</p>

<p>Also watched “City by the Sea” which was good.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=recipezaar&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Searching for “Recipezaar”</a> on Google has always generated about 200,000 pages in the result set. Today, it’s up to <em>6.5 million</em>! What happened?? I know that Recipezaar alone has  millions of pages (with all the ways you can browse recipes) but, to my knowledge, <a href="http://www.google.com/bot.html">Googlebot</a> has never completely finished crawling the site to index every page. Not sure that it means anything, but it’s strange that we’ve jumped so high in total indexed pages.</p>

          <p>Went to the all-new <a href="http://www.nwculture.com/NWC/Islands/VashonIsland/CoffeehousesCafes/SoundFood/sf.html">Sound Food</a> restaurant on the island last night for dinner. I think it was the 2nd best food I’ve had on the island; an island that is severely lacking in good restaurants. We then came home and played a close game of Trivial Pursuit and I won with an unbelievable gimmie question: “Who, after recovering from testicular cancer, wrote a book called <em>It’s not about the bike</em>”. HA ha.</p>

<p>Speaking of <a href="http://lancearmstrong.com/">Lance Armstrong</a>, he <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=ap-tourofmurcia&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns">finished 32nd</a> in the 5-stage Tour of Murcia today.</p>
