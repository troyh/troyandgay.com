          <p>I finally got around to making my <a href="/ferry/">Ferry Schedule Application</a> for <a href="http://www.wapforum.org/">WAP</a>/<a href="http://www.wirelessdevnet.com/channels/wap/training/wml.html">WML</a> phones. I’ll never misread the ferry schedule again!</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=recipezaar&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Searching for “Recipezaar”</a> on Google has always generated about 200,000 pages in the result set. Today, it’s up to <em>6.5 million</em>! What happened?? I know that Recipezaar alone has  millions of pages (with all the ways you can browse recipes) but, to my knowledge, <a href="http://www.google.com/bot.html">Googlebot</a> has never completely finished crawling the site to index every page. Not sure that it means anything, but it’s strange that we’ve jumped so high in total indexed pages.</p>

          <p>Went to the all-new <a href="http://www.nwculture.com/NWC/Islands/VashonIsland/CoffeehousesCafes/SoundFood/sf.html">Sound Food</a> restaurant on the island last night for dinner. I think it was the 2nd best food I’ve had on the island; an island that is severely lacking in good restaurants. We then came home and played a close game of Trivial Pursuit and I won with an unbelievable gimmie question: “Who, after recovering from testicular cancer, wrote a book called <em>It’s not about the bike</em>”. HA ha.</p>

<p>Speaking of <a href="http://lancearmstrong.com/">Lance Armstrong</a>, he <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=ap-tourofmurcia&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns">finished 32nd</a> in the 5-stage Tour of Murcia today.</p>

          <p>Every couple of weeks someone else realizes that they have become <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=29600">addicted to Recipezaar</a>.  Not only do folks really get off on our caring community, but they really are cooking better, more, trying new things.  I get so touched when I hear them repeat our motto too “you make Recipezaar a bigger and better place.”</p>

<p>And if that wasn’t all this weekend is the <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=29513">Dana-athon</a>.  Dana is one of our members who is battling brain cancer, and folks around the world are cooking her recipes this weekend as a way to send her good energy.  What a neat idea.  UPDATE: 164 people participated!  I doubt I could get 164 people to cook for me…</p>
