          </h3>
            <p>For 30 years Washington state has had a bill languishing in committee which would protect gay people from discrimination in the workplace, in getting housing, loans, etc. Yesterday, <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/221211_civilrights22.html">one of my college pals, now our state Minority leader helped defeat the bill</a>.  <a href="http://www1.leg.wa.gov/senate/finkbeiner">Bill</a> was good guy at Whitman, and when he started in state politics a few years ago he was a Democrat (he switched teams about 10 years ago).  Bill even admits “it [discrimination] happens in some occurrences,” but he didn’t take the small step he could have to prevent it.  Bill, what are you saying to your gay friends?</p>

<p>Another of our Whitman colleagues, Mark Putnam, captures the disgust I feel best</p>

<blockquote>...while it is unsurprising to me that politicians who are old and really religious, or perhaps closeted themselves, are anti-gay, it's shocking when someone your age, who you went to college with, is in a position of power and is thwarting legislation in your state that is only trying to get equal protection in employment, housing, etc. for people. </blockquote>

<p>Bill, do you really want to be remembered like the congressmen who voted against the 14th amendment (equal protection based on race), against the 15th amendment (right to vote for blacks) or for the Jim Crow laws?  A few years from now you will….</p>

<p>Our favorite Time magazine writer, <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/authors/sandeepkaushik.html">Sandeep Kaushik</a> did an <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/2005-04-14/city2.html">article about Bill on this issue before the vote</a> in the Stranger, as well as a terrific <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/2005-04-21/feature.html">expose of how Microsoft (typically a good supporter of gay rights for employees) abandoned support for the legislation after a local megachurch pastor threatened a boycott of the company</a>.</p>

            <p>Gay went for an hour-long run this morning along the waterfront and brought back coffee and coffee cakes for breakfast. We then went out for a walk <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=vancouver,canada&amp;ll=49.273617,-123.118662&amp;spn=0.005236,0.007596&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en">along the waterfront</a> and sat in a park right on the water with a great view of the Yaletown highrises – Yaletown is condoland!</p>

<p>Then for a long lunch at <a href="http://www.markjamesgroup.com/restbrew/yaletown/yaletown.html">Yaletown Brewery</a> where we drank beers and sat out in the sun and talked. One thing that always surprises us at Vancouver restaurants is that they never rush you out, I bet we could have sat there for hours just drinking water if we wanted.</p>

<p>We walked around a little more and happened into a wine cellar near the hotel and got a few bottles of wine to take home. We wanted the same great wine we had last night at dinner, <a href="http://www.cedarcreek.bc.ca/">Cedar Creek</a>’s Pinot Noir. And we found it and a couple others that were recommended by the salesgirl.</p>

<p>We asked why all the wines are Canadian – French and Californian wines are hard to find here. The salesgirl explained how Canada’s laws work. Get this: the store is government-run (but nice, not what you’d expect from a government operation), the government sets the prices on all the wines and does not allow stores to mark the price up at all, the government takes 67% of the cost of a bottle in tax and only allows British Columbian wines to be sold. The purpose of all this control is to foster tourism to the <a href="http://www.winesnw.com/okanagan.html">Okanagan Valley</a>, BC’s “Napa Valley”, if you will. That’s socialism for ya… you’d think if they were trying to duplicate Napa Valley’s success, they’d do what Napa did: encourage wineries, make great wines and the rest just happens. What is it about capitalism that socialists don’t get? ;)</p>

<p>Back at the hotel, my love for <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=2709">my Airport Express</a> continues…. I had the good sense to bring it along, thinking that the hotel’s non-WiFi internet would give us too short an ethernet cable. I was right, and we didn’t want to be tied to the desk in the room to use our laptops. So I plugged in the Airport Express, plugged in the short ethernet cable and voilá, we have WiFi in the room (and so do our neighbors).</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We drove up to Vancouver today for a mini-vacation and to belatedly celebrate  <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=3044">Gay’s birthday</a> since we didn’t really do anything since we were so busy with work. We came to Vancouver last year for Gay’s birthday and had so much fun that we thought we’d do it again this year.</p>

<p>This time we took the “truck route” across the border through <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?oi=map&amp;q=Sumas,+WA">Sumas, Washington</a>. Friends who go to Canada often tell us this is the smart thing to do. Unfortunately, they didn’t tell us that it was smart to bring a passport when going this route, so we caught a bit of gruff from the border patrol (fortunately, I had a voter’s registration card which seemed to make them marginally happy).</p>

<p>We got to <a href="http://www.opushotel.com/">our hotel</a> at 6:30pm and went right to dinner at <a href="http://www.crestaurant.com">C</a>. A (chilly) walk along the marina back to the hotel and here we are. :)</p>

            <p>Why is April 15 Tax Day in the US? I’ve always thought it interesting that it’s as far from Election Day as possible and figured that had to be the reason (since voters tend to vote their pocketbook).  However, the date really <a href="http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20020415.html">has nothing to do</a> with Election Day.</p>

<p>Anyway, here’s some <a href="http://cagle.com/news/Taxes2005/main.asp">Tax Day comics</a>.</p>
