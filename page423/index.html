          <p>Salon is running an article on how <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/03/03/desktop_linux/index3.html">Linux desktops are just mimicking Windows</a>. Nothing terribly new in the article, just more people realizing that simply copying the Windows UI is not the secret to success against Windows. Linux desktops actually have to be better than Windows; easier-to-use and more crash-resistant. But the article is incorrect that a lower price is not going to help. Lower prices <em>always</em> helps. And eventually Linux on the desktop just may meet the “good enough” bar and coupled with a lower price, Windows is in real trouble. I think that’s the most likely scenario. I have no confidence that Microsoft will come up with something so revolutionary and innovative that they quell the <a href="/archives/2003/02/21/">Linux uprising</a>.</p>

          <p>We were the last people in the country to see <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/MyBigFatGreekWedding-1113661/">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</a>.  It was cute and universally chuckle-able, but it really wasn’t all that.</p>

<p>…now the season opener of <a href="http://www.hbo.com/sixfeetunder/">Six Feet Under</a> was mind blowing.  I can’t believe I’m saying this about a TV show, but I don’t think I’ve <em>thought</em> so much in weeks.  Clearly I should be reading more…</p>

          <p>Saw <a href="http://www.orangecountymovie.com/">Orange County</a> last night. This must be one of the shortest movies ever made at 77 minutes. It was okay, somewhat funny, but always entertaining. <a href="http://www.caaien.com/jackblack/">Jack Black</a> was funny as usual. But I recommend the DVD as it has extras that are almost funnier than the movie, especially the “interstitials”. The “Advanced English” class that discusses literature in terms of Hollywood is classic Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Teacher: “Can anyone name an important figure in Romeo &amp; Juliet”
Student: “Claire Daines”
Teacher: “Claire Daines. Good.”</p>

<p>Teacher: “Today we will discuss the classics. Can anyone name a classic?”
Student: “Smells like teen spirit?”
Teacher: “Nirvana. Good classic.”</p>

<p>Sean: “I thought this class was advanced English”
Teacher: “Am I speaking French, Sean?”</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2003/03/02/postfix.html">Postfix</a>
        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>I finally went against the geek in me and ditched <a href="http://sendmail.org">sendmail</a> from our internal mail server and moved to the simpler <a href="http://www.postfix.org">Postfix</a>. The reason being that I simply couldn’t figure out how to configure sendmail to send mail to another server as a relay. Seems so simple and I even read the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/sendmail2/">bat book</a> to try to figure it out, but was unsuccessful. Postfix did it with one configuration setting.</p>

<p><a href="http://fetchmail.org">Fetchmail</a> still pulls down our mail from our public mail server to our internal server and it worked without a hitch with Postfix. And Postfix was amazingly easy to install, it even makes itself a replacement for sendmail by aliasing the sendmail binaries to itself. I wish I’d done this years ago!</p>
