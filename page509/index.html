            <p>For the 2nd time in 1 year and 1 day, we refinanced. 5.625% interest rate, 5-year ARM (with a 5% lifetime cap). Closing costs should be made up for in 5 months.</p>

            <p><a href="http://slate.msn.com/?id=2069348">Michael Lewis on why fatherhood makes him risk averse</a> – even averse to the stock market, which he covers.</p>

<p>A few years ago a piece in the University of Michigan medical journal argued that the reason the internet bubble reached such ridiculous heights was that huge numbers of investors were now taking drugs that lowered their inhibitions. With a third of the U.S. investing population on Prozac or some other mood-enhancing drug, the paper concluded, it was no wonder that so many people believed the market would simply keep rising.</p>

            <p>Salon has an <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/08/13/media_titans/index.html">article</a> about 2 books that claim the web is dead; one says because of lack of business, the other says because of lack of content. Of course, they’re both wrong. <em>In this context, statements like “Web content is dead” or “AOL Time Warner will dominate” aren’t so much wrong as irrelevant. Web content is everywhere. No one can dominate the . And the Web belongs to its users. That’s not the end of a story, it’s the beginning.</em></p>
