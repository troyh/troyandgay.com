            <p>One of the biggest surprises about building Recipezaar has been the creation of the community.  Our community is probably more important than our content, and the technology we create to support it is certainly our greatest value.  <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_politics.html">Clay Shirky articulates feelings</a> I have had about the most interesting (and sometimes most difficult) part of that work:</p>

<p><em>“Further complicating all of this are the feedback loops created when a group changes its behavior in response to changes in software. Because of these effects, designers of social software have more in common with economists or political scientists than they do with designers of single-user software, and operators of communal resources have more in common with politicians or landlords than with operators of ordinary web sites.”</em></p>

<p>(He gives a brief history of social software and notes that in 20 years of email most improvements have been on the administration side “rather than making it easier for the group using the software to accomplish anything” which is something I completely agree with from my Outlook days.)</p>

            <p>Kicking the Taliban out of Afghanistan was officially good: Afghanistan today launched the “.af” domain suffix. The first .af sites: <a href="http://www.moc.gov.af">Communications Ministry</a> and the <a href="http://www.undp.org.af">UN’s Development Programme</a>.</p>

            <p>AOL (remember them?) is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/10/technology/10AOL.html">working on Mystro TV</a>, a competitor to TiVo. It sounds cool in some ways, but of course, being built by a media company, is designed to prevent commercial skipping, to even add more commercials (!), to prevent time-shifting for some programs, etc. It’s a guaranteed failure for those reasons alone. And I like that the big companies are finally realizing that TiVo is  a great example of <a href="http://www.wordspy.com/words/disruptivetechnology.asp">disruptive technology</a>.</p>

            <p>Spent the greater part of yesterday working on our business taxes – due March 15.  The government actually made it easier on small business this year by not requiring a lot of accounting rigamaroll.  It still cracks me up when they have to list the estimated amount of time it takes to fill out the forms and do recording keeping for them as part of the Paperwork Reduction Act – would you like a receipt for your reciept?</p>

<p>Also watched “City by the Sea” which was good.</p>
