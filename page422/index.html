          <p>TiVo <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rc/030306/tech_tivo_earns_1.html">announced quarterly earnings</a> today. They’re still  losing money ($21 million for the year) but they’re growing and now have 624,000 subscribers. I believe their goal is 1 million by the end of the year. I can’t wait til they ship the <a href="http://tivo.com/4.9.asp">Home Media Option</a> so I can view my <a href="http://apple.com/iphoto/">iPhoto</a> pics and listen to my <a href="http://apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> music through TiVo.</p>

<p>And I wish they’d start competing with Netflix. They now have the tools to deliver almost-on-demand movies. I’d pay for that!</p>

          <p><a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> is <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/03/03/06/1548245.shtml?tid=124">adding</a> to their subscription offering. Now, you get access to new stories 10-20 minutes before non-subscribers. I like Slashdot and could be convinced to pay for it, but is this the best they can do for subscribers? Slashdot is late as it is. I find the news from RSS feeds and <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire">NetNewsWire</a> long before Slashdot gets it posted, sometimes by a day or two (!) – 10-20 minutes is not a great benefit.</p>

<p>Why don’t they offer useful services like a summary of the week’s news along with the highly-moderated discussions posts (not everyone reads Slashdot 5 times a day), more customized news filtering, email notifications of specific articles, etc.</p>

          <p>Some days are pretty rough and sometimes I question how much time I devote to <a href="http://recipezaar.com">work</a>, but the emails we get from people really give me a boost. Here’s some from the last few days that made me particularly happy:</p>

<p>Thanks for the “welcome.”  I don’t spend much time at all on the net as I am far too busy - but I LOVE TO COOK!!  That is my hobby.  I cook for myself
and three big guys (my DH and two DSs) and they love my cooking.  My good
friend <em>[name omitted]</em> (who also LOVES TO COOK) told me about your website yesterday.  When I left her house last night, I came home and logged on to your website.</p>

<p>I then did something that I have NEVER done and never thought I would ever do.  I stayed on your website from about 10:30 p.m. until
almost 4:00 A.M.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It was totally crazy!!!  I couldn’t tear
myself away from it!!!!  I kept looking at the clock on my computer screen
and telling myself - “<em>[name omitted]</em> - you have GOT to go to bed!!!!!!  I loved it!!!  It’s absolutely the GREATEST!!!!!!  Thanks for coming up with such a fantastic idea and website!!!!!  Went to the store tonight and bought $130
worth of groceries - I’m ready to try some of those GREAT recipes!!!  Thanks again!!!</p>

<p>Hi, A friend just told me about your site this weekend. I am THRILLED
that I can key in Low Potassium and get recipes. My husband is a diabetic who
has heart and kidney problems and is on special diets. It is so difficult to
find recipes that he can actually eat. THanks for your wonderful site.</p>

<p>I just found your website this evening.  I have already sent e-mails
to all of my friend who are just as crazy about cooking and baking as I am, telling
them about the wonderful site I have discovered.
I have been into many sites for recipes and information, but yours, I must say,
impressed me the most.  It is totally organized, informative, etc. and is extremely
user friendly.
I LOVE IT!!!  THANKS FOR THE BEAUTIFUL WEBSITE.  LOOK FORWARD TO CHECKING IT
OUT ON A DAILY BASIS.</p>

<p>Emails like this from people out of the blue are the reason I get out of bed in the morning and keeps me working til midnight every night.</p>

          <p>People are <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1026-991164.html?tag=fd_top">starting to warm up</a> to the idea of paying for online content. In the US, $1.3 billion was spent on online subscription services: _“Whether or not consumers will pay for content is no longer a matter of debate. Clearly, they will.” _</p>

<p>The early successes are online dating sites, financial services and entertainment/lifestyle. These are all things that the web can do much better than offline versions, which is why they are successful. <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipes</a> fit well into that model, me thinks. Maybe this will (finally) be the decade that publishers stop using expensive dead trees and start using cheap recycled electrons.</p>

          <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/altria.gif" alt="altria.gif" />Kraft/Phillip Morris changed their name to the ever corporate meaning-free “Altria”.  I don’t have much to say about it, but I am love with their logo graphic and I don’t know why.  I sort of <em>get</em> that it tries to communicate the multitude of brands the conglomerate represents, but I prefer to think of it as a pixilated detail of some meaning-free photo.  I’m sure it cost at least $100k to produce, and my spirits lift contemplating the hours spent debating it within the bureaucracy – “don’t you think that red block just makes us look ‘fat’?” – but for me, it was worth it.  It is one of the prettiest things I’ve seen in a while…and yes, it probably does make me forget for an instant that they are <a href="http://www.altria.com/about_altria/01_04_02_kraftfoodsnorthamerica.asp">Marlboro &amp; Lunchables</a>.</p>
