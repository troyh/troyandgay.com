          <p>Today is Havana’s first birthday. We survived the first year and, more importantly, so did she.</p>

<p>She’s had an eventful year… she’s done a lot of traveling: Hawaii in September, Oregon wine country in October, Cannon Beach, Oregon and Mexico in January, a drive to central California and back in March and a trip to Florida in April. She learned to say a few words and a little sign language, she learned to crawl, climb stairs and a few weeks ago, to walk and even stand up on her own.</p>

          <p>Thomas Friedman wrote a good “op-ed article”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/30/opinion/30friedman.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;oref=slogin about the lack of an energy policy and points out the stupidity of McCain and Hillary focusing on a gas tax moratorium, Obama seems to be the only smart one on this topic:</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>bq. The McCain-Clinton gas holiday proposal is a perfect example of what energy expert Peter Schwartz of Global Business Network describes as the true American energy policy today: “Maximize demand, minimize supply and buy the rest from the people who hate us the most.”</p>

<p>It goes on to point out the lack of focus on alternative sources of energy like wind and solar:</p>

<p>bq. While all the presidential candidates were railing about lost manufacturing jobs in Ohio, no one noticed that America’s premier solar company, First Solar, from Toledo, Ohio, was opening its newest factory in the former East Germany – 540 high-paying engineering jobs – because Germany has created a booming solar market and America has not.</p>

<p>The attention the rising gas prices has received attention from all three candidates, which is just sympathy pandering, but why not pander to people in ways that create jobs?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> “Economists are pointing out”:http://uk.reuters.com/article/wtMostRead/idUKN3038243520080430?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 how stupid the idea is:</p>

<p>bq. “I think it is a very bad idea,” said Gilbert Metclaf, a economics professor at Tufts University currently working with the National Bureau of Economic Research. “If we want people to invest in energy-saving cars, we need some assurance that the higher price paid for these cars is going to pay off through fuel savings,” he said. “It is a very short-sighted, counterproductive proposal.”</p>

<p>bq. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman was similarly underwhelmed: “It’s Econ 101: the tax cut really goes to the oil companies,” he wrote on his blog on Tuesday.</p>

<p>And Obama had the most pithy line:</p>

<p>bq. “This isn’t an idea designed to get you through the summer, it’s an idea designed to get them through an election.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Our yard maintenance guy of over 3 years quit abruptly today in protest when we hired a neighbor’s kid to mow our lawn for the summer. I’m usually not surprised when adults are petty and juvenile, but I expected more from this guy, a guy who prides himself on his “metaphysical awareness”. What’s ironic is that he refused to mow our lawn for years thinking it beneath his skill-level and only started mowing the lawn last September when we went on vacation. I guess at some point between September and yesterday he decided that mowing a lawn was a core part of his being and taking that away from him was more than he could bear. In retrospect, I shouldn’t be so surprised… last year he complained that we were wasting our money and his time when he held a hose for hours on end watering our garden. So we added a sprinkler to our irrigation system so he wouldn’t have to do that, but he then expressed anger at the loss of that job. Some people just can’t find happiness.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Today they took DE “Bruce Davis”:http://www.nfl.com/draft/profiles/bruce-davis?id=1695, OT “Tony Hills”:http://www.nfl.com/draft/profiles/tony-hills?id=258 – finally an offensive lineman!, QB “Dennis Dixon”:http://www.nfl.com/draft/profiles/dennis-dixon?id=748, LB “Mike Humpal”:http://www.nfl.com/draft/profiles/mike-humpal?id=1367 and FS “Ryan Mundy”:http://www.nfl.com/draft/profiles/ryan-mundy?id=4393.</p>

<p>They took 3 offensive players and 4 defensive players. All seem like good picks and everyone seems to be excited about Rashard Mendenhall. But don’t they know they need to improve their offensive line? As one commenter I saw said after they picked a QB, “they’ve just added another tackling dummy.”</p>
