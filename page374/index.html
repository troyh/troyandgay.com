            <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/0936070250.jpg" alt="0936070250.jpg" /> I’ve been running a lot lately. A “lot” for me is like 5 miles 4 times/week.  I’m trying to throw in a weekly long run of 7 1/2 miles too until that is my regular run – can you tell there is a 2 1/2 mile loop near my house.  My pace has gone from 10 minute miles to 9 1/2 minute miles over the past 3 1/2 months that I’ve been running regularly.  So far only 3% body fat loss, but no actual weight loss…slow and steady…I have a couple of (marathon running) gal-neighbors to run with, and they are teaching me <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0936070250/recipezaar-20">Jeff Galloway’s plan</a> (see hokey 70s style book cover on right).  I’d like to run a half-marathon this year.  I figure, I trade my commute time for exercise, and I’m a completely different person that day.  You’d be amazed at how great it feels at 4p to think “I ran 5 miles today.”</p>

            <p>Gee, the DoJ now thinks that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/business/business-microsoft-settlement.html?ex=1372651200&amp;en=ed5323401b6ba604&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">Microsoft is not complying with the settlement</a>. I suspect the next we hear from <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/kotelly-bio.html">Colleen Kollar-Kotelly</a> will be something like “Ok, Microsoft, I said I might slap you on the wrist for the grievous crimes you committed. Now I just might threaten to make that threat again.”</p>

<p>Kollar-Kotelly is a moron. In the settlement, she actually used the word “reasonable” in describing the fees Microsoft can charge competitors to see the source code. That’s lawyer-ese for “absolutely anything you want”. So Microsoft charged outrageous fees.</p>

<p>Just to give a quick history… Microsoft settled the original case against them in 1995. They broke that settlement and ended up in this new antitrust case. They lost the case but the DoJ decided to have another settlement. And they’re now surprised that they’re breaking this one? I think I see a pattern here.</p>

            <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/letour2003.gif" alt="letour2003.gif" />I’m getting excited about the <a href="http://www.letour.fr/indexus.html">Tour de France</a> that starts this weekend. Lance Armstrong is being <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=ap-tour-armstrong&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns">his usual modest self</a> and <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-dc&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns">trying to stay calm</a>. I think <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-toursimoni_sports_feature&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns">Simoni</a> is his biggest threat, but <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-tourullrich_sports_feature&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns">Ullrich</a> may be closer to his top form of ‘97 (which was amazing) and <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-tourbotero_sports_feature&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns">Botero</a> will be interesting to watch. Last  year, I thought he had it sewn up from the start, but I have a feeling this year could be more difficult.</p>

            <p>Call me dumb, but I just came to a realization as to why the Mac is so much easier to use than Windows. It’s simply business. Any businessperson can tell you that you build your product to meet your customers’ needs. The customer for Windows is not the consumer, it’s <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?search=OEM&amp;go=Go">OEM</a>s. Microsoft sells very few copies of Windows on store shelves, the overwhelming majority of revenue comes from those who ship Windows on their computers – OEMs like Dell, Compaq, Gateway, etc. However, the customer for the Mac <strong>is</strong> the consumer because Apple doesn’t have OEMs, they have to build their product to appeal to the consumer. So that’s why you see an incredible number of features and customization in Windows that OEMs want/need (but that consumers don’t need or want) that get in the way, but the Mac is designed so suit the consumer.</p>

<p>It seems so obvious, but in all my years in the industry, I’ve never seen anyone put it this way. As a former Microsoft employee, I don’t even think that the employees realize this. The natural assumption is that Microsoft is just very bad at design and Apple is very good at it. I still think that’s true, but it’s true because Microsoft has no need to be good at design – the OEMs aren’t complaining about poor design.</p>
