            <p>Not that <em>the</em> soundtrack for <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/07/001550.php#001550">this movie</a> is worth purchasing, just that the movie itself would not be half as good without the sounds track that accompanies it. I really liked this film, but the music pulls together some very wacky scenes and keeps you emotionally involved with some strange charactesr and many David Lynch-style non-sequiturs that are never explained.  Adam Sandler proves himself to have a lot more depth and talent that the sweet naive guy he normally writes for himself.</p>

            <p>Troy pointed me to this <a href="">Michael Kinsley article in Slate</a>, and this is probably the most libertarian idea I’ve gotten behind in a while, but it makes a great deal of sense.  Now that <em>Lawerence v. Texas</em> gets the government out of gay sex, undoubtedly (and ironically) folks will be soon arguing to bring the government into gay marriage.  Kinsley has another solution:
<em>to end the institution of marriage. Or rather (he hastens to clarify, Dear) the solution is to end the institution of government-sanctioned marriage. Or, framed to appeal to conservatives: End the government monopoly on marriage. Wait, I’ve got it: Privatize marriage.</em>
Let people marry how they want, and let it mean nothing to the government.  Let questions of property and children be decided by commitments instead of paper.  Happens already…</p>

            <p>Coincidentally, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/Equilibrium-1118792/">Equilibrium</a> and <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/07/001550.php#001550">Punch-Drunk Love</a> both have <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Name?Watson,%20Emily">Emily Watson</a> in them. <em>Equilibrium</em> is a sci-fi movie about a world where the government, in order to create peace, drugs the populace to remove their emotions – emotions cause evil, of course. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Name?Bale,+Christian">Christian Bale</a> is part of an elite police force trying to destroy “the underground” of people who refuse to take the drug. But after forgetting to take his daily drug, gets his emotions back and rebels against the government. The plot is not all that new (“Fahrenheit 451”), but the acting is very good, the story is entertaining and the action is well-done. In a world of <em>The Matrix</em> clones, this movie has some original, albeit unrealistic, fight scenes.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/PunchDrunkLove-1117428/">Punch-Drunk Love</a> is a cute little story about a guy whose seven sisters berated him so much as a child that he has a total lack of self-confidence. Except in the few short circumstances when he does have confidence.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>I’m not a very patriotic person. I tend to think it’s random that I happen to be born within the borders of a specific country. I like to think I’m a citizen of Earth, the Milky Way, whatever, than a citizen of the United States. But I was born here and I’ve lived here all my life. So I am a citizen. I’m a typical American, be that good or bad. I’ve spent some time outside the US and I was <em>extremely</em> anti-US policies in my youth and I still have some huge disagreements with our government (and probably always will). But seeing the fireworks and general happiness in people in the US on July 4th makes me feel good and I’m not sure why.</p>

<p>After 9/11, the patriotic-ness in the US surprised me (and probably surprised those siding with the terrorists as well). July 4th of any year will never live up to that feeling, I suppose, but both July 4ths since I’ve felt like they were little versions of the post-9/11 patriotic-ness. Granted, the meaning of July 4th is probably lost on most Americans and it’s more of a chance to drink beer (yay!) and eat hamburgers and hotdogs and enjoy pyrotechnics, but there’s something fascinating to me that everybody does it in unison. And they want to do it.</p>

<p>We went to a party at a friend’s house tonight for the holiday. We stopped on the way at a couple stores and everyone (strangers) were abnormally friendly. It’s surprising that in a country as big as the US, there’s still a feeling of togetherness and nationality.</p>

<p>I’ve probably had two too many beers. <img src="/img/smile.gif" alt="" /></p>
