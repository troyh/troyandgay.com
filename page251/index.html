          <p>Slept well last night, despite being in a new place. :) Charging the camera battery so we can take lots of photos when we go into Ubud proper today.</p>

<p>Last night, we had a great dinner at the villa prepared by the in-house cooks. But they made enough food for 4 or 6 people, so we barely made a dent in it. And the cook (16 or 17 years old?) was visibly worried. He came to our table and asked “Is there a problem with my food?” We tried to be effusive about how good it was, but we’re not sure we convinced him.</p>

<p>Our view over the coconut trees and river is amazing, but it’s been too cloudy to see the mountains (just like in Seattle). Not sure if it’s always this way near the mountains of Bali. I hope not, because the sunset would be great.</p>

<p>The coffee in Jimbaran Bay was delicious, but the coffee we’ve had since then has been less so; more like a strong Sanka. We’re going to see if we can find some good coffee in Ubud and buy some for the villa. We also noticed signs of a second Indonesian beer: <a href="http://www.balihaibeer.com/home.html">Bali Hai</a>. Found a <a href="http://www.thebackpacker.net/worldbeers/balihaidraftbeer_2301_worldbeers.htm">good review</a>, but the mention of Corona makes me pessimistic. Their web site even says they make a stout. Another thing to look for in Ubud. <strong>Update:</strong> we had Bali Hai “Draft Beer” (that’s what the label on the <em>bottle</em> said) at a restaurant. No good. We’re getting dangerously close to Budweiser with this one.</p>

<p>BTW, the dialup internet here is almost as slow as GPRS on cell phones! GPRS here is 30kbps compared to 9600bps in the US. And people wonder why GPRS is popular in other countries but not in the US.</p>

          <p>After a stop for lunch at a great restaurant in Sanur, Legong Restaurant, we made it to our place in Ubud.</p>

<p>The photo shows our view from the villa, and you can see the <a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/forward.weml?property_name=sayan&amp;">Four Seasons in Sayan</a> (the <em>other</em> Four Seasons in Bali) nestled in the trees.</p>

          <p>It is hot here… even with SPF30 lotion, just an hour or two in the sun has given me sunburn! At 9am it’s too hot to sit in the sun. But we frequently see Balinese in long pants and even jackets since this is almost winter time in Bali – they’re getting chilly. I can’t imagine being here at the peak of summer.</p>

<p>The Four Seasons has been nice but just too “touristy”, not to mention expensive. Before arriving, we read that the Balinese people are very polite and friendly. And it’s true… everyone has been incredibly nice and smiles everywhere (and not just at the hotel). The only Balinese we’ve learned so far is “Tarima Kasih” (Ta-REE-ma Ka-SEE), which means “Thank you”. We say that a lot. It always strikes me how people in the poorest countries in the world that I’ve visited are happy, while Americans, who should be happy, appear unhappy and even angry. I doubt you’d hear a Balinese person say “I hate her/him, they’re so damn happy all the time”. American cynics who read that might say “Sure, they want your money, that’s why they smile at you”, but Americans want my money too, and they don’t smile at me. ;)</p>

<p>We’re checking out today and going inland to <a href="http://www.indo.com/active/ubud.html">Ubud</a> for a week for more relaxation, reading, beering, maybe some shopping and less seafood and more native Indonesian dishes. We will only have dialup internet so posting photos is going to be more difficult, well, time-consuming at least, so I probably won’t be posting as many photos as I have the last few days.</p>

<p>We spent the day tanning, reading, swimming, repeat. Then we went to lunch:

<p><em>The</em> beer in Indonesia:

<p>It’s a light pilsner, which I usually don’t like, but nothing beats a cold Bintang on a hot day.</p>
