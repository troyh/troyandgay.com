            <p>Gay’s dad and aunt are arrived today to watch Illy and the house while we’re in Mexico this week. And they got up early yesterday to get in line before 6am on a freezing cold Spokane morning to get the 2nd limited release of Dry Fly Whiskey for us for Christmas. Bless their hearts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4161733073/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2708/4161733073_99c3de4821.jpg" alt="Dry Fly Whiskey" /></a></p>

<p>They were 37th and 38th in line and Dry Fly treated them to hot coffee and a complimentary ski hat. They also got us very cool Dry Fly baseball hats.</p>

<p>“We visited the distillery”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/02/dry-fly-distillery/ last year. Dry Fly is Washington State’s only distillery and they just started releasing their whiskey. “I missed getting their first release in August”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/08/10/its-finally-raining/ due to the small number they can make so I was very happy to get a bottle from their second batch.</p>

<p>It’s very good. It doesn’t have the spicy or sweet taste of Maker’s Mark, my favorite. It’s very smooth and almost buttery. It’s also not a bourbon, it’s a an all-wheat (100% Washington State wheat too) whiskey. I really like it. I wish I could take it with me tomorrow on vacation.</p>

            <p>Steve and Renuka and their kids, Owen and Claire, came over for a post-Thanksgiving dinner. They brought a bottle of <a href="http://www.leonetticellar.com/">Leonetti</a> (we’ve never had a Leonetti) that we drank with a delicious dinner. After dinner, the kids watched a couple movies on the big screen: Tinkerbell and Shark Tale. Havana was in heaven with her friends and Hudson even sat still and watched one of the movies. I’ve kept a large selection of beers in the fridge that I haven’t gotten around to drinking and when me, Steve and lots of beer choices are in the same room the next day is never good for me. I had the worst hangover I’ve had probably all year on Sunday. But it was a fun time.</p>

            <p>Today is Illy’s 14th birthday. Happy Birthday Illy!</p>

<p>We’ve had her for over 10 years now. Her vital stats are all still good but she has arthritis so she has trouble getting up and down the stairs (unless food is involved) and getting up from laying down. In spite of that, she still comes up the stairs and down the stairs to the office every morning to spend the morning with us. And when the kids have lunch, she somehow knows about it and she climbs the stairs again to get down for any food that Hudson may drop on the floor. And then she comes back up to the office.</p>

            <p>My favorite holiday of the year.</p>

<p>We had the usuals: turkey, sweet potatoes, green beans, cranberry sauce, stuffing and pumpkin pie. The kids didn’t like the sweet potatoes but I thought they were fantastic with brown sugar and pecans on top.</p>
