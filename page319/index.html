            <p>Since Red Hat’s announcement that they aren’t supporting free editions of Red Hat Linux, I’ve been considering switching to another Linux distribution, with <a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a> at the top of the list. Then, along comes <a href="http://www.nat.org/">Bruce Perens and his UserLinux</a>, which will be based on Debian. Nice.</p>

<p>Incidentally, that Wired article referenced <a href="http://www.nat.org/">Nat Friedman</a> of <a href="http://www.ximian.com">Ximian</a>. I remembered that he offered me a job as a “VP of Technology” (I hope I am never a VP of anything) a few years ago. I wonder how much <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=novl">Novell stock</a> I’d own right now if I had switched.</p>

            <p>Uh oh, two packages being delivered via FedEx ground this week. Why is “ground” always FedEx these days? Fortunately, they’re both shipping from California and are both scheduled to be delivered on Thursday. Thursday is when the “good FedEx driver” is working my area. I’m optimistic that the FedEx problems (<a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/10/001753.php">1</a>, <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/10/001786.php">2</a>, <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/11/001799.php">3</a>) are behind us and they’ll be back to their reliable service.</p>

<p>One package is a <a href="http://www.overclockercafe.com/Reviews/cases/X-DreamerII/">tricked-out case</a> for our new combination firewall/mail server and the other is a really nice <a href="http://www.hp.com/rnd/products/switches/switch2524-2512/summary.htm">managed switch</a> that will replace our (almost full) switch at our colocation site. I’m pretty excited about the switch. And check out <a href="http://www.hp.com/rnd/support/warranty/index.htm">the warranty</a> on it – free next-day replacement for as long as I own it. Granted, it’s a switch so there’s little that can go wrong, but it’s reassuring.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/11/001814.php#001814">Spam is annoying</a>, but the thing I love about it is that instead of getting lawyers involved, technologists are fighting back. It’s going to make the internet a less open place, but it’s far better than having more laws and bigger government, in my opinion.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.time.com/time/2003/inventions/invmusic.html">Time Magazine</a>: Other inventions this year may have more altruistic intentions (like Dean Kamen’s water purifier) or be more visible on street corners (like those ubiquitous camera cell phones). But for finally finding a middle ground between the foot-dragging record labels and the free-for-all digital pirates and for creating a bandwagon onto which its competitors immediately jumped, Apple’s iTunes Music Store is Time’s Coolest Invention of 2003.</p>

            <p>Spam is not limited to email.  (Background: the way Google works is sites are rated higher in results based on the number of other sites that link into it, so it is to your advantage to have other sites link to yours.)  <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/08/001611.php">Every week</a> or <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/04/001367.php">so</a> some <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/03/001266.php">slimey site</a> will come along and post a “comment” on one of our blog entries from, oh say, MARCH with a link to their site, thereby gaining a free link to their site and better PageRank in Google.  Some folks are dealing with this using a shared <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/">BlackList</a>, and we are currently just not displaying URLs in comments.  I ran across this <a href="http://chujoe.net/archives/000182.html">hilarious account of someone’s attempt to bill a blog spammer for unauthorized advertising</a>.  I think this will be my newest strategy!</p>
