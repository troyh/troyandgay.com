            <p>In <a href="http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2002/12/11/piracy.html">Piracy is Progressive Taxation, and Other Thoughts on the Evolution of Online Distribution</a>, Tim O’Reilly explains why electronic distribution is valuable and desirable. He also predicts that subscription sites will flourish and notes that HBO, a subscription service on top of your cable (ISP) bill, is television’s most profitable network. Why? Because of content.</p>

            <p>Steven Johnson correctly points out that Apple’s approach to UI design is superior to MS’ (duh!). One interface to everything has always been MS’ vision and it’s just wrong. Just look at Outlook! Specialized tools are always superior. <a href="http://slate.msn.com/?id=2075219&amp;device=">Is the Computer Desktop an Antique? - Soon, Apple and Microsoft will need new metaphors for their operating systems.</a>: _But Apple may be on to something. Interface consistency was a wise strategy for the early years of PC adoption, but the Mac’s new Swiss-army-knife approach makes sense now that using desktop interfaces is as second-nature as reading to a whole generation of computer users. After 20 years of point and click, we’re ready to handle multiple interfaces within a single operating system. _</p>

<p>_Sales of the online diet service WeightWatchers.com, for example, are at a pace of $57 million a year. The site, which charges $14.95 a month, publishes <strong>one new recipe a week</strong>. But most of the site’s use is for its message boards and an online diary that keeps track of eating according to the Weight Watchers program.</p>

<p>“Most of the pure content we have is free,” said Sharon Fordham, the site’s chief executive. “What people will pay for is the software that leverages what the internet is uniquely capable of.”_</p>
