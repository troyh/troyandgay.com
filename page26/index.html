<p>This jersey has turned Hudson into a football nut. The next day after getting it he woke up and got dressed in it before coming down for breakfast, which never happens. He wears it every day and begs people to play football with him all day long. </p>

<p>The games are predetermined: he tells you who you are and whether you are supposed to win or lose the game. The game is the same play over and over:  he explains where the blue line is and where the yellow line is, then he hikes the ball to you, you throw it to him and he runs away from you, while you, who instantly switched teams, are supposed to tackle him. Sometimes he gets a first down (“crossed the yellow line”) and sometimes he gets a touchdown, depending on what he decides during the play.</p>

<p>He even sleeps with the football under his pillow. Adorable.</p>

          <p>3 of 4 teams should not have been in the playoffs. The NFL should apologize to Green Bay for wasting their time. Houston and Cincinnati should apologize to the NFL for not forfeiting.</p>

          <p>Author of one of my favorite pop-psych books, <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/gilbert/about.html">Stumbling on Happiness</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/science/study-in-science-shows-end-of-history-illusion.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">Daniel Gilbert</a>: </p>

<blockquote>“Middle-aged people — like me — often look back on our teenage selves with some mixture of amusement and chagrin,” said one of the authors, Daniel T. Gilbert, a psychologist at Harvard. “What we never seem to realize is that our future selves will look back and think the very same thing about us. At every age we think we’re having the last laugh, and at every age we’re wrong.”</blockquote>

          <p>Gay and I went to <a href="http://www.fremontbrewing.com/">Fremont Brewing</a>’s new taproom for (imperial) beers this afternoon. It’s a great new taproom, much better than the old one, with several beers only available at the taproom. Dark Star Imperial Oatmeal Stout:</p>

          <p>I’ve increased my workouts this week by 50% and had a tough one this morning after just 4 hours of sleep. After 15 minutes, I bonked so I ate a handful of dried blueberries for energy. It helped, but I ended up stopping 3 more times to rest. It took me 2 hours to do a 1-hour workout. After showering, I made myself a grilled peanut butter and strawberry jelly sandwich, poured myself a homebrew and sat down to relax and read. I feel much better.  </p>
