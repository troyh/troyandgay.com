              <p>A year since the big outage last year, the generator is finally installed and connected. Today Suburban Propane finished the hook-up to the 250 gallon tank we had installed last week. The electrician did the final electrical hook-up today. We tested the system by cutting power from the utility, 7 seconds later the generator started up and about 15 seconds after that the transfer switch switched the house’s power to the generator.</p>

<p>It’s even bearable volume-wise. Here’s how it sounds up-close and from about 40 feet away under heavy load (the furnace running in the house). At normal load, it’s even quieter.</p>

<p>The electricians had to re-wire the existing panels to consolidate the core stuff into one panel that would be powered by the generator:</p>

<p>Now that we have a generator, our neighbors should thank us, we’ve probably guaranteed that we’ll have no power outages in the area.</p>

              <p>After a 6-day electrical outage last December we decided to get a fat generator to power the entire house for 2-3 days at a time. The “Onan”:http://www.cumminsonan.com/ 30,000kW genset was delivered early summer and we’re <em>finally</em> getting it installed. This week we had a concrete pad built and today we had the generator placed on it.</p>

<p>Next is the electrical work and getting a propane tank installed to power it.</p>

              <p>It’s impossible to listen to any sports talk without hearing these phrases:</p>

<p><em>Having said that,…</em>: Those are useless words. I know you just said that, don’t tell me you just said it, just make your next point. The next clause in this statement either contradicts the previous point or it affirms the previous point. If your next point contradicts your previous point, you don’t have a point or an opinion, you’re just talking to hear yourself talk. If it affirms your previous point, don’t add this transitional phrase, just make your next point, we can understand.</p>

<p><em>It goes without saying…</em>: It doesn’t go without saying because you just said it.</p>

<p><em>It is what it is.</em>: This is legitimate insightful commentary in sports circles. The questioner asks something like “Why is the team’s win/loss record blah and blah?” and the answer is “It is what it is.” That’s probably true, but it’s a nonsense statement.</p>

<p><em>At this point in time,</em>: Another useless phrase. “At this point,” is valid, but adding “in time” is redundant. It can’t be a point that is not in time, can it?</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>I had a terrible DirecTV customer service experience that was magically turned into a good experience.<!-- more -->We recently switched back to “DirecTV”:http://directv.com (from Comcast) so I could watch “NFL Sunday Ticket”:http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/global/contentPageNR.jsp?assetId=900044 again to watch “Steelers”:http://steelers.com games. Last Saturday, the receiver died, I went to turn it on Sunday morning to record the games but there was no picture. I rebooted it several times without success. I called their 800 number and after 30 minutes of rebooting with them over the phone, they agreed it was dead and told me they’d have a new one shipped to me. Fortunately, the original installer left another (non-DVR) receiver at the house so I could use it to watch the games that day.On Wednesday, I got the new receiver but it booted and was functional but couldn’t be activated. I spent 2.5 hours on the phone with at least 7 different tech support people and hold music before they agreed that it was also defective. They said they’d ship me another receiver but I wanted it shipped overnight rather than 2-day shipping so that I could get it before Sunday to watch the NFL games. They insisted that it was impossible to have it shipped overnight but I know FedEx does ship overnight so I insisted that they get a supervisor to approve an overnight delivery. The last 45 minutes of my call was waiting for a supervisor so that I could explain my situation: I pay $350 (!) for NFL Sunday Ticket and I’m going to lose a second week without a “DVR”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video_recorder (which is essential when watching 3 4-hour games that start at 10am on the west coast). I couldn’t talk to a supervisor and I eventually just gave up on hold and accepted that I’d have to wait until next week to get my replacement receiver.So I was surprised when the FedEx truck arrived on Friday with the receiver! Someone somewhere inside the DirecTV machine actually did do whatever was necessary to get it shipped to me overnight even though I couldn’t get that agreed to while on the phone. Good customer service save, DirecTV.</p>
