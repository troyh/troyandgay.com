            <div class="post-content">
              <p>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> ran an article (article is behind a pay wall, so no link) today on online recipe sites, which featured Recipezaar, AllRecipes and Snacksby (where’d they find that one?!). You always hear people complain that the press does a bad job of taking your words and putting them in print, and we’re no exception. The article highlights AllRecipes eventual 60,000 recipes but ignores that Recipezaar has 170,000 today and 50,000 photos. Or that AllRecipes recipes are 95% user-submitted (why only 95%?) but didn’t mention that 100% of ours are user-submitted, or that they go up instantly, not after 18+ months. But at least the recipe they picked from Recipezaar, <a href="http://beta.recipezaar.com/108775">Baklava Salmon</a>, was their favorite. And they linked to <a href="http://beta.recipezaar.com">our beta site</a>! And, to the writer’s credit, they did hold off on the article several weeks until our beta went public, so Thank You! :)</p>

<p>It’s great to be in the Wall Street Journal; we can check that one off our list. But their readership is not our target market. Instead of getting more traffic from people who want to eat, I imagine we’ll get inundated by calls from VCs, SEO companies, ad sales companies and marketing companies again.</p>

              <p>I took a “vacation day” today, layed in the hammock all afternoon catching up on podcasts on my iPod. I’m one of those people who has a tough time relaxing, I find it difficult to do nothing productive. Even as a kid, I couldn’t just watch TV, I had to read a magazine or a book at the same time to salvage the wasted time. It’s sick, really. And it took me a good hour in the hammock to stop thinking “Ok, go get something done.” But I persevered, and it worked. I relaxed. (Best tagline ever: <a href="http://www.hammocks.com/">Hammocks.com</a>’s “<em>Accomplish Nothing…</em>”)</p>

<p>The dogs stayed outside with me all day, Illy even fell asleep next to the hammock, in between sprints to the road to chase cars away. Ouzo occassionally dropped the tennis ball for me to throw with the <a href="http://www.chuckit.com/products/chuckit/chuckit.html">ChuckIt</a> but even he mostly layed in the shade, which, for those of you who know Ouzo, is out of character. It’s been hot here in Seattle the last few days with temperatures in the 90s. But it’s great in the shade with a nice breeze.  I love Seattle weather! By 4pm I had my all-time favorite beer, a Fuller’s ESB that our friends that were over for dinner last night left in the fridge. Good friends leave good beer in your fridge.</p>

              <p>Congratulations to Floyd. I didn’t think he’d do it at the beginning, and was sure he wouldn’t after he lost 8 minutes in the Alps. But his comeback was one of the great moments in sports. And to think, just when the French finally get rid of an American winning the Tour every year, another one comes along and wins it. That’s what they get for bashing Lance and really bashing Floyd this year.
I really thought Hincapie would do well this year, but he was over an hour behind Landis. Leipheimer didn’t do much better. The other Americans weren’t even relevant. Now Floyd goes for hip-replacement surgery, but I won’t say that he won’t win it next year….</p>

              <p><strong>WOW!</strong> The next day, Floyd Landis takes off by himself at the beginning of the tough mountain stage and held it til the end, winning the stage and gaining back all but 30 seconds of his lost time. Floyd was not very strong, I didn’t think, the whole tour but what he did was what legends are made of!! I couldn’t imagine anything like this happening, but I’m glad I witnessed it. Lance was great, all around, but he never did anything so risky and so courageous as what Floyd did today. Amazing. Even the old time Tour director said it was the best stage he’s ever seen in all the Tour de France.
And he’s really matured, after his terrible day, he accepted full responsibility for his failings. He didn’t blame his team, he didn’t blame other riders, he didn’t blame mechanical problems. It takes a lot to admit your flaws are your fault. Hats off, Floyd.</p>

              <p>Floyd Landis, who got the yellow jersey, lost it and regained it lost it again in a <em>lousy</em> performance. He lost 8 minutes on the final climb of the day yesterday while Carlos Sastre and Oscar Perreiro just flew up the mountain. Perreiro regained the yellow jersey and I can’t see him losing 8 minutes today or in Saturday’s time trial. There won’t be any Americans on the podium this year, I don’t think. Perreiro, Sastre and Menchov are the likely 1, 2 and 3.
How much a good team around you matters was demonstrated well by Floyd’s Phonak team – they disintegrated on almost every climb this year leaving Floyd all alone. You don’t win a Tour de France without a strong team.</p>
