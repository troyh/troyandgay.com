        <article>
          <p>I never thought I’d see this in a million years, but there is at least one person at Microsoft who wants it to shrink in size (most ‘softies think bigger is better): <a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/">Mini-Microsoft</a>. He’s right, the company is <em>way</em> too big at 50,000 employees. The “mighty Microsoft” has half the employees that IBM has but only makes 1/3 the revenue. Something’s wrong.</p>

<p>And he discusses the Company Meeting, which I also learned was a much smaller affair than in previous years. When I was there, they would rent out the Kingdome and <em>all</em> employees would take the day off and go listen to Gates and the execs speak and see demos of products other groups are doing. It was a huge pep rally and, I have to admit, fun. But I always thought it was a colossal waste of money. Some people were affected by it in a positive way, but mostly, everyone was cynical about the war cries that execs put out (and the crashing of Windows during half the demos was demoralizing).</p>

<p>As an aside, in reading that I was reminded of one of the most annoying things to me when I was there: the “Microsoft-isms”. I still hear some of these today from friends. Things like “the high-order bit” (the most important thing), “Sked-plus me” (schedule a meeting with me online using Schedule+/Outlook), “action item” (something you need to do after discussing it at a meeting), “OOF” (Out Of Office, where the ‘F’ comes from I never found out) and at our wedding a friend, I think asking why I proposed to Gay after all these years, actually said “What flipped the bit?”. :) I imagine it’s like sports fans who shorten everything to one syllable… “the M’s”, “the ‘hawks” and “the Sons” are what Seattle sports fans use to refer to the Mariners, the Seahawks and the Supersonics (“Sonics” wasn’t even short enough).</p>

<p>Oh, and he references a now ex-softies’s blog: “Eighty-percent”:http://www.eightypercent.net/. That reminds me of probably the thing I hated the <em>most</em> when I was there arguing about features. PMs, when they are painted into a corner with their idea, throw their hands up and say “But 80% of all users….”  This drove me nuts. No matter what it was, 80% of all users did what this employees does, with no empirical evidence to back it up; it was just a “gut feeling”. It was wrong, of course, and it was always 80% – some PM years ago must have heard a developer talk about the “80-20 rule”:http://management.about.com/cs/generalmanagement/a/Pareto081202.htm  so they applied it to everything (albeit backwards) and other PMs thought it sounded intelligent, so it carried on.</p>

I agree, CDs are better in every way: they sound better, they don’t restrict my freedom to listen to my music wherever I want, and they’re a decent and reliable backup.</p>

          <p>I see lots of people struggling with Windows (and IE) on a daily basis. It’s sad considering they have a solution. But what’s terrible is that they just take this punishment as if “computers are just this way” or “I’m just not computer savvy”. It’s crazy. What other industry survives with such unhappy customers? When will Microsoft start paying attention? When people stop using Windows! …</p>

<p>The WSJ’s “Walt Mossberg”:http://ptech.wsj.com/ptech.html: _The single most effective way to avoid viruses and spyware is to simply chuck Windows altogether and buy an Apple Macintosh. Apple’s operating system, Mac OS X, is harder for the criminals to infect…</p>

<p>There has never been a successful virus written for Mac OS X, and there is almost no spyware that targets the Mac. Plus, the Mac is invulnerable to viruses and spyware written for Windows. Not only is it more secure, but the Mac operating system is more capable, more modern and more attractive than Windows XP, and just as stable.</p>

<p>Macs are as good as, and often better than, Windows PCs at doing the most common computing tasks: Web browsing, e-mail, word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, photos, music and video. The Mac version of Microsoft Office can handle Windows Office files with ease, and it produces files that Office for Windows handles effortlessly. Apple’s computers are also gorgeous._</p>

<p>And “David Pogue”:http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/16/technology/circuits/16stat.html echos the same in the NYT in his review of the new “iMac”:http://apple.com/imac: <em>In the long run, they’ll benefit most from the iMac’s stealth feature: Mac OS X. Not only is this operating system rock-solid and, for a first-timer, much easier to understand than Windows, so far it’s also 100 percent free from viruses, Trojan horses, spyware and all the grief that comes with them. This month, Microsoft is rolling out to the much larger Windows XP audience an 80-megabyte bundle of security patches called Service Pack 2. Mac maniacs are fond of pointing out that most of the new Windows security features were built into Mac OS X from Day One.</em></p>

          <p>Troy and I have been working very hard on a mess of new features for Recipezaar since our wedding.  We haven’t been eating well; we’ve worked just about every Saturday and Sunday for a month.  One night Troy noticed a drip from the ceiling in our main floor bathroom, which coincided with the sound of running water I was hearing in our bath directly above the leak.  We tightened a faucet, the sound stopped; we put a wastebasket under the leak and forgot about it for two days.  At eleven o’clock at night, Troy used the downstairs bathroom and the drip was worse, not better.  We went outside and the shingles on the outside wall were actually seeping water.  I lost it.  Our house was seeping – it was like the black stuff in <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1000875-amityville_horror/">Amityville Horror</a>.</p>

<p>I have a homeowner’s theory that no one knows how water gets to their house or how to turn it off until their first major plumbing disaster.  We did manage to get the water turned off, and the problem fixed the very next day.  The seeping stopped and the fans have since been turned off, and we think everything is just fine.  Water always finds its own way out.</p>

        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="/2004/09/15/im-a-little-coffee-pot-short-and-stout.html">I'm a Little Coffee Pot Short and Stout</a>
        </h3>
        <article>
          <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/burrGrinder.jpg" alt="" /><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/coffeemaker.jpg" alt="" />Please meet the newest additions to the Recipezaar Office Kitchen.  We’ve needed a new coffeemaker for years.  No amount of vinegar could descale the innards of the Krups. Brewing directly into a thermos is essential when the coffee maker is downstairs from the office, and this is the only 12 cup thermal carafe on the market, so we splurged and bought the grinder to match.  The set brings me almost as much pleasure as our <a href="http://www.tivo.com">TiVo</a>.</p>

<p><strong>My observations:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I’m surprised the maker sports a basket instead of a cone filter coming from Starbucks – I had been led to believe the cone filter was superior by the same company years ago – but regardless the coffee is amazing.  I wonder a bit if just replacing the filter every few months could have had a bigger impact than descaling.  The “new coffee” always has a yummy oily sheen to it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The LCD on the maker is backlit blue when the machine is on, and beeps when the coffee is done – much better than the coughing noise the Krups grew to make.  The timer then keeps track of how long it has been since the pot brewed – how nice.  Because it brews into the thermos and shuts off there isn’t even a need for the auto shut off on the burner, there is none.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The old maker fit under the cupboards, just in reach of our extending faucet which made pouring fun.  The new maker has to be positioned to far for this, BUT the water vessel lifts out of the back with a handle.  Best of all there is a pressure release spout at the bottom of the vessel which is how the water is moved from the bottom of the vessel through the maker.  Putting the “bucket” in the back of the maker it sort of sits slowly down on its little pressure release, and is very satisfying to do. Oh you are back in your comfy spot, I think.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pot is adorable.  I regularly make it dance because it is so cute and stainless steel with a handle made out of an ergonomic grippy plastic that <em>makes</em> you want to offer someone a “topper”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cuteness stops there.  The pouring mechanism sucks.  It is not just slow and splattery, it is improperly designed.  A disc covering the whole top opening set to a spring keeps the top closed.  When the pot is in the maker a button at the top center depresses and the coffee flows in through a hole; however, when you pour you press a different button which depresses only <em>part</em> of the disc, the part closest to the handle at the opposite end from where you pour.  So you the coffee actually must travel up the sides of the disc and then back down.  It is grossly inefficient and, well slow and splattery.  Troy pushes down the top button as well when he pours, which makes pouring a two-handed operation.  This is its only fault.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The grinder does a good job, and it is nice that it is an unmanned operation now, but it is far more messy than I expected.  I thought trading having to pour grounds directly from the grinder into the filter with pour from the “ground catcher” would completely eliminate all the coffee ground detritus on the counter.  I was wrong.  The little house for the “ground catcher” seems to drop a lot of grounds after the “catcher” is removed, so there is still a mess.  I am not sure fi I just need to master a certain tap to release these before removing the “catcher” or what; I’m still working on that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Oh, and I wish the grinder could hold a full pound of coffee instead of just a third, so I could get rid of the other coffee container.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I am not really a coffee geek: I praise Starbucks over some independent coffee houses.  My kitchen is a disaster (dishes with food on them will sit for days “I do dishes on the weekends” is perfectly reasonable to me) so don’t be misled by my anal complaints.  The point is I spend a few minutes with these products every day.  I know them well, and love them.  There are few things you spend so much time with EVERY DAY.</p>
