            <p>Americans across the country are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/04/politics/campaign/04vote.html?pagewanted=2&amp;hp&amp;oref=login">registering to vote in record numbers</a>. Do Americans finally realize that a different person in the White House can make a difference? It’ll be interesting to see what the actual turnout is like on November 2.</p>

            <p>After breakfast, we went into Ubud and walked up and down Monkey Forest Road and the road parallel to it. We decided not to go into the Monkey Forest today, but will one of these days. Ubud is the “cultural heart” of Bali. By that, they mean lots of art galleries and places to buy Balinese stuff. In the market I bought a cheapie (both in quality and price, $3) Bintang Beer t-shirt.</p>

<p>We don’t know why these chicks are colored this way, but there were two guys with cages like this on their bikes:

<p><em>Update:</em> We found out why the chicks are dyed colors. They sell them to children, who “like the colors”, as pets.</p>

<p>We had lunch at some place on Monkey Forest Road before returning to our car. We then went to a grocery store to get some beer and coffee to take back to the villa.</p>

<p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_1757.jpg" alt="IMG_1757.jpg" /></p>

<p>Then we decided to look for bourbon and finally found some at a huge new Walmart-like store. No Maker’s Mark, but they did have Jack Daniel’s (and a Balinese temple made out of beer cans).</p>

<p>Then we went back to the villa for a swim and to relax before dinner. We got the chef to only make a few dishes this time. Tonight we had Satay Lilit (finely-shredded chicken with shredded coconut satays), chicken in curry sauce, a green vegetable (not sure what it is), and of course, steamed rice.</p>

<p>For dessert, we had Black Rice Pudding, which I really liked:</p>

<p>Geckos crawl around the house, here’s one on the ceiling of the living room:</p>

Where else but on vacation with a 13 hour plane ride can you reasonably complete a 900 page book that details every little trip and dinner the president hosts in 8 years.  Heck, it took 400 pages and months to just get into the White House.  I almost couldn’t read the sections involving Ken Starr.  I can’t believe the lies he got away with….  And to think they tried to impeach Bill Clinton for lying about a personal matter, but more of W’s lies about Iraq are uncovered everyday and people are dying for them with no outcry in the press.
I have to admit, I liked <a href="http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2237">Sidney Blumenthal’s</a> and <a href="http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2530">Madeliene Albright’s</a> versions better.  They spent a lot more time providing historical background and political analysis to those years than Clinton had room for.  Still, it makes me long for a smart president again.  Hopefully…</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Once again, I am amazed at my Mac… anyone who knows me knows I’m a true computer dork, but even though I’m an advocate of computers, they routinely suck, so I’m more amazed than most when they work right, or better yet, as you expect them to work. My iBook is frustration-free even when on vacation.</p>

<p>It’s got four ways to connect to the internet: Wi-Fi, wired ethernet, phone line or Bluetooth-enable cell phone. So if it’s possible to get on the internet where you are, the iBook can do it. The minimum I need is cell service, which is just about everywhere on the globe these days. All laptops today have two of those connection methods, many have three and a tiny few have all four. But the least expensive Mac laptop has all four.</p>

<p>OS X makes connecting trivial. With WiFi, you just open it up and it finds the network and you’re connected. This worked great at SeaTac airport, at the Taipei airport and at the hotel. The hotel was only difficult because they were prepping their pay-for-internet service which always causes problems (the Four Seasons, of all hotels, should give free Wi-Fi to its customers) so I had to call the concierge to get a username/password combo.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m dialed into a local ISP so I’m connected. But Gay’s iBook is also online sharing my internet connection over WiFi between our two computers. And to do that, I just pressed the Start button on Internet Sharing Network System Preference panel. I didn’t even have to tell it I want to share the modem connection (as opposed to one of the other 3 connection types) because it’s smart enough to know that’s how I’m currently connected, i.e., it doesn’t ask me stupid questions. Gay sat down, opened her iBook, joined the network and was online in seconds without a second thought. This is how it should be, but so often it’s not.</p>

            <p>Slept well last night, despite being in a new place. :) Charging the camera battery so we can take lots of photos when we go into Ubud proper today.</p>

<p>Last night, we had a great dinner at the villa prepared by the in-house cooks. But they made enough food for 4 or 6 people, so we barely made a dent in it. And the cook (16 or 17 years old?) was visibly worried. He came to our table and asked “Is there a problem with my food?” We tried to be effusive about how good it was, but we’re not sure we convinced him.</p>

<p>Our view over the coconut trees and river is amazing, but it’s been too cloudy to see the mountains (just like in Seattle). Not sure if it’s always this way near the mountains of Bali. I hope not, because the sunset would be great.</p>

<p>The coffee in Jimbaran Bay was delicious, but the coffee we’ve had since then has been less so; more like a strong Sanka. We’re going to see if we can find some good coffee in Ubud and buy some for the villa. We also noticed signs of a second Indonesian beer: <a href="http://www.balihaibeer.com/home.html">Bali Hai</a>. Found a <a href="http://www.thebackpacker.net/worldbeers/balihaidraftbeer_2301_worldbeers.htm">good review</a>, but the mention of Corona makes me pessimistic. Their web site even says they make a stout. Another thing to look for in Ubud. <strong>Update:</strong> we had Bali Hai “Draft Beer” (that’s what the label on the <em>bottle</em> said) at a restaurant. No good. We’re getting dangerously close to Budweiser with this one.</p>

<p>BTW, the dialup internet here is almost as slow as GPRS on cell phones! GPRS here is 30kbps compared to 9600bps in the US. And people wonder why GPRS is popular in other countries but not in the US.</p>
