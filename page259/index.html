          <p>For the first time, Microsoft has stated in their SEC filing that “Linux servers outpaced Microsoft’s for the first time in terms of growth percentage.”:http://money.cnn.com/2004/09/09/technology/techinvestor/hellweg/  And, significantly, linux installations are under-reported since many linux servers are bought without an OS – we have ~20 (I’ve stopped counting) linux servers and none register as linux servers since they were all purchased without an OS and we installed the OS ourselves.</p>

          <p>Gay was interviewed by “Red Herring”:http://www.redherring.com and the article, “Gourmet geek”:http://www.redherring.com/article.aspx?a=10846&amp;hed=Better+than+you%3a+Gourmet+geek, is up now. :)</p>

<p>I think they chose a bad photo, but Gay doesn’t like her photos wear she wears glasses, although I do. A “fluff” piece, but if someone told me a few years ago that either one of us would be in Red Herring, ….</p>

          <p>Geeks sometimes stray from their gadgets and look to “improve” the world with their higher intelligence, and they often happen across food, cooking and recipes. Here’s a new one “from Slashdot”:http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/04/09/10/1734235.shtml?tid=133&amp;tid=1&amp;tid=8:</p>

<p><em>“It’s not often I post about a website, but this one is different. It is Cooking For Engineers. No big deal, you’d think - a web site about recipes and cooking. But go look at how he’s presented it. *Most recipes are designed for women, and their funny way of looking at the world.* These are very different and instantly understandable for tech geeks like us.</em> (Emphasis mine)</p>

<p>No, recipes are designed for humans. I always find it funny how engineers look at the world… if food was designed by engineers and not Mother Nature we’d have two ingredients to choose from: water and rice. Two perfect ingredients, why would you need any more than that? And, of course, we’d have thousands of rice cookers to choose from, each one adding one more bell and/or whistle! ;)</p>
