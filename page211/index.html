          <p>Wow, even Fox News, the “What To Think Network”, is <a href="http://www.newshounds.us/2005/03/27/white_house_to_fox_news_steer_clear_of_schiavo.php">running scared of the Terri Schiavo story now</a>. Great quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
"Fox finally found an issue it couldn't brainwash the public into supporting."

"All of the fanatics where handed a new scapegoat on a silver platter, Jeb Bush. Goes to show how fickle and dangerous fanatics can be."

        <article>
          <p>Tom DeLay, who called the judge and Michael Schiavo “terrorists”, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002221334_delay27.html">took his own father off life support 16 years ago</a> and asked the doctors to not resuscitate his father, even though he could have lived, albeit in a vegetative state because his father “wouldn’t have wanted to live like that”.</p>

<p>Moreover, Tom DeLay sued (and won) the company that made the coupling that caused his father’s injury. And Tom DeLay has since spearheaded legislation to protect corporations from such lawsuits.</p>

<p>Do as I say, not as I do.</p>

          <p>Inspired by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/w00kie/sets/180637/">these</a>, I made my own transparent desktop. It’s a fun thing to do on a rainy Seattle saturday.

<p><strong>Update:</strong> So Slashdot gets around to <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/03/27/029216&amp;from=rss">talking about this</a> (remember when Slashdot was first? Now they seem to be last). And the overriding criticism is that people “have too much time on their hands”. From the time I first saw this til the time I had mine up was 15 minutes. And I did it twice (the first one sucked). And I had to run downstairs to find the camera and scrounge around for our tripod (which isn’t needed). And I had to charge the battery.</p>
