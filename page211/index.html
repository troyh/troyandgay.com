              <p>Funny how things work…. on Sunday, Gay and I were talking about how long it’s been since we had any technical issues with the site. I even knocked on the table and said “Watch, something will happen tomorrow”. Today, two days later, our bandwidth provider had a problem with a downstream bandwidth provider’s router owned by <a href="http://www.wiltel.com/index.html">WilTel</a> so the site was inaccessible from about 11:10am to 11:53am. Our bandwidth provider got it resolved quickly, but I wonder if we hadn’t known about it how long it would have taken.</p>

<p>These are the worst problems to have because you can’t be notified about them. We can monitor our own hardware (and we do) so we can know when something goes awry. And we can monitor the first-level router from our hardware. But the problem router was in San Francisco, far away from us. So the only way to know when a problem like this occurs is to test the entire line from the outside in periodically, which we also do. But who do you call? Which bandwidth provider is the problem? It takes time just to know where the problem is before you can act on it and get it fixed.</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="http://yipes.com">Yipes</a> was very helpful.</p>

              <p>The days of “simultaneous release” for movies <a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/business/national/12500564.htm">is nearing</a>, DVDs now are released within four months of the theatre release, sometimes sooner. Amazingly, it’s not Hollywood that is upset about that prospect, but the theater owners. Poor, poor theatre-owners. Did you think you would have a business forever? Did you think people <em>liked</em> buying a gallon of Coke for $5, sitting in uncomfortable chairs and have their feet stick to the floor? The only business that treats its customers worse is the airline industry.</p>

              <p>Hurricane Katrina <a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/12500225.htm">will hit New Orleans today</a> after killing seven people in Florida and will likely kill many more. My parents live in Florida, a place hit by several hurricanes every single year that always kill people. You’d think fewer people would die from hurricanes given the advance notice of them. Yet, in <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001443.html">2004 alone</a>, 218 people were killed from hurricanes.</p>

<p>Yet my mom fears for <em>my</em> life because I live in an earthquake-prone area. You have to go  <a href="http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/eqlists/us_deaths.html">back to 1965</a> (40 years!), to match that number of deaths from earthquakes. Between 1965 and 2005, 220 people have been killed in earthquakes in the US. And 188 (85%) were killed in just three of the largest earthquakes.</p>

              <p>In an odd coincidence, on Friday we visited with Gay’s first boss and my second boss. We had lunch with the first boss Gay had at <a href="http://adobe.com">Adobe</a>, <a href="http://www.theplatform.com/default.aspx?p=management">Ian Blaine</a>, a founder and <em>the</em> bigwig at <a href="http://theplatform.com">thePlatform</a>. Early on in the days of Recipezaar we would have beers with him at a neighborhood pub and talk about thePlatform and Recipezaar. Frankly, I thought thePlatform would never fly – streaming media on the internet in 2000 can’t work! But it did and thePlatform is doing great, led by Ian (and others, I’m sure). I’m sure he thought Recipezaar was a sure-failure. I’m glad we were both wrong. :)</p>

<p>That night, my second boss that I had when I lived in DC, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=adam+blum&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Adam Blum</a>, flew into Seattle for the <a href="http://www.hotstriathlon.org/section_home/home_intro.htm">HOTS triathlon</a> on Vashon. I met Adam at my first professional job out of college, he left and recruited me away. I’m glad he did because that was my second favorite job I’ve ever had (second to Recipezaar, of course). Adam and I both went on to Microsoft in Seattle (he went to Microsoft Consulting in DC first), then Adam left Microsoft shortly after I did for Silicon Valley to be the CTO at <a href="http://commerceone.com">CommerceOne</a>, <a href="http://talaris.com">Talaris</a>, <a href="http://systinet.com/">Systinet</a> and now <a href="http://good.com/">Good Technology</a>. Adam is one of the few people that I’ve met in my professional career that never fails to impress me; he started and sold his own company in college, he’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0471538477/qid=1125252745/sr=8-5/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i5_xgl14/002-5519179-8748829?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">written</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0471161772/qid=1125252835/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/002-5519179-8748829?v=glance&amp;s=books">three</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1558284311/qid=1125252835/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3/002-5519179-8748829?v=glance&amp;s=books">books</a> (the first written while he was getting his Master’s Degree in Computer Science), has four kids, he teaches a graduate course at Berkeley, he does <em>two</em> triathlons each weekend and can talk more intelligently (and quickly) about tech issues than most people I’ve heard speak. He’s the most Type A person I’ve ever met, which is even more shocking to me given that I am an extreme Type B. I have to say these nice things about him since he claims to read this site. :)  After the triathlon, Adam brought us a six-pack of one of his favorite beers from his area, <a href="http://www.lagunitas.com/">Lagunitas IPA</a>, a <em>very</em> hoppy beer and a bottle of <a href="http://www.ridgewine.com/wines/wines.tml">Ridge Wine</a>, also from his area of California. I’m looking forward to drinking that tonight.</p>
