<blockquote>“The goal of the future is full unemployment, so we can play. That’s why we have to destroy the present politico-economic system.” This may sound like the pronouncement of some bong-smoking anarchist, but it was actually Arthur C. Clarke, who found time between scuba diving and pinball games to write “Childhood’s End” and think up communications satellites.
</blockquote>

<p>The current politico-economic system doesn’t need to be destroyed, it needs to be encouraged – Capitalism’s goal is 100% unemployment.</p>

<blockquote>The Puritans turned work into a virtue, evidently forgetting that God invented it as a punishment.</blockquote>

<p>Religion seems to always be hypocritical, short-sighted and misguided.</p>

<blockquote>...I’ve always understood that the best investment of my limited time on earth was to spend it with people I love. I suppose it’s possible I’ll lie on my deathbed regretting that I didn’t work harder and say everything I had to say, but I think what I’ll really wish is that I could have one more beer with Chris, another long talk with Megan, one last good hard laugh with Boyd. Life is too short to be busy.

</blockquote>

<p>I agree!</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>For the first time being away from all three kids, we decided to go to Portland for a couple nights.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/7465339290/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8024/7465339290_7b28794738.jpg" alt="Beervana" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->
<p>Mo stayed at the house to watch the kids and we left the house after 11am on Wednesday and got to <a href="http://prostportland.com/">Prost!</a> around 1:30 for lunch. The place was filled with people watching the Portugal vs Spain soccer game (which ended in a thrilling “nil-nil” score before Spain won in the shootout). Next to the pub was 10 or so food trucks, Gay got her lunch from a food truck and I figured “when in Berlin” and ordered a knachtwurst and a bratwurst from the kitchen. We had a couple uninteresting German beers with lunch.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/7465301346/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7279/7465301346_0131fa8213.jpg" alt="Lunch at Prost!" /></a></p>

<p>We walked down the street to look at the little shops in the Mississippi District and then drove to <a href="http://hopworksbeer.com/general-info/bikebar">Hopworks Urban Brewery</a> on the outskirts of the city. We had their sampler set, which is all 10 of their beers so no self-selecting what you already like. We bought a growler and a 22oz bottle of their stout and left for the hotel.</p>

<p>We stayed at <a href="http://www.thenines.com/">The Nines</a> over <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2009/03/30/ashland-to-portland/">three years ago</a>, the last time we were in Portland. It’s a nice  hotel in a great location downtown. After getting unpacked and relaxing in the room, we walked to <a href="http://www.baileystaproom.com/">Bailey’s Taproom</a> for a pre-dinner beer. It was packed and we found a couple chairs outside on the street and enjoyed the weather. Next to us was a group of 5 or 6 people who we ended up chatting with over more beers. They were happy to give us recommendations for dinner, which included a run-down of seemingly every restaurant in Portland. We ended up deciding on <a href="http://www.clarklewispdx.com/">Clark Lewis</a> so we took a cab across a bridge and found a cool place and we sat against the railing open to the street. We got the prix-fixe menu and had a nice long dinner before cabbing back to the hotel.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/7465342116/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8144/7465342116_3080197c96.jpg" alt="At Clark Lewis" /></a></p>

<p>We slept in for the first time in years and ordered a great room service – I loved their house-made english muffins! We wanted to see two breweries: <a href="http://www.hairofthedog.com/">Hair of the Dog</a> and <a href="http://www.cascadebrewingbarrelhouse.com/">Cascade Brewing</a>. Hair of the Dog is a tiny brewery that makes excellent beers but are rare to find in Seattle, even rare in Portland!, so I figured I would finally get to taste more of their beers. As luck would have it, this day was a day <a href="http://blog.oregonlive.com/thebeerhere/2012/06/de_struise_eel_river_a_couple.html">they turned the tap house over to a Belgian brewer and served only his beers</a>, so we couldn’t taste any of their beers. We got a sample set of the Belgians, which were good, and then made our way several blocks east to Cascade. Cascade is another tiny brewery famous for sour beers, which I’ve come to enjoy after resisting it for a while. There we got a sample set of 8 beers, most of which were quite good.</p>

<p>For lunch, we went to Henry’s Tavern, back in downtown Portland. This seemed like a touristy place, a restaurant housed in the original Henry Weinhard’s Brewery with 100 beers on tap. I was mostly correct, but the food was pretty good and they had some good local beers on tap. After lunch, we headed back to the hotel and had a coffee in the hotel restaurant, Urban Farmer.</p>

<p>We took a short nap in the hotel, got cleaned up for dinner and took a cab to dinner at <a href="http://lepigeon.com/">Le Pigeon</a>, a highly-acclaimed restaurant – the chef won 2011’s James Beard Rising Star award. We weren’t able to get a reservation on such short notice, but we figured we would try to get a walk-in seating. As expected, they took our name and phone number and we went up the street to a divey-kitschy bar Doug Fir (it’s like a log cabin inside) to wait. Gay loves that kitschy vibe, I hate it. Fortunately, the restaurant called after just one drink and we went for dinner.</p>

<p>Le Pigeon is a tiny place. Our foyer in our house is bigger. We were lucky enough to get seats at the counter where we could watch the chefs cook and weren’t right up against strangers at one of the small tables. Dinner was fantastic, one of my top 5 dinner experiences. Our appetizer was the Lobster &amp; Chicken Tart, lobster coleslaw and vinegar (white vinegar, <em>not</em> balsamic!) ice cream on top. Sounds crazy, but everything went together so perfectly it was delicious. For dinner, I had “Thanksgiving in June”, duck stuffed with turkey sausage served on an oyster bread pudding. Gay had lamb and risotto. For dessert, I had the Bacon Waffle, a waffle with maple ice cream and peanut butter whip and a slice of bacon, Gay had the Foie Gras Profiteroles which were covered in caramel and dusted with, get this, a foie-gras powdered sugar mix, which is apparently made in a centrifuge with a fatty compound that binds the sugar to dehydrated foie gras. Creative!</p>

<p>After dinner, we walked down the quiet street waiting for a cab at 10:30pm but never found one and ended up walking all the way back to the hotel. It was a nice walk and it’s good that Portland is so small!</p>

<p>The next morning, we slept in even later, until almost 10am. Nice! We packed, went down to Urban Farmer for breakfast and then checked-out of the hotel. We stopped at <a href="http://belmont-station.com/">Belmont Station</a> to bring some Oregon beers back to Seattle and then to <a href="http://www.paxtongate.com/seestores_Portland_lg.aspx">Paxton Gate</a>, one of those little shops in the Mississippi District, to get some presents to bring back to the kids and headed back to Seattle.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Our new <a href="http://www.bringperlickhome.com/products/48-refrigerator-beer-dispenser">Perlick kegerator</a> can hold two small (7.75 gallon, 1/4 bbl, pony keg, half-keg, whatever you want to call them) kegs, one big (15.5 gallon, 1/2 bbl, full keg) and one small keg, four Cornelius kegs or some combinations of those. Local breweries usually sell their beer in the small kegs but they don’t always have them on-hand since they’re not as popular as big kegs. But many will fill Cornelius kegs that home brewers use. So I can take my kegs to them and have them fill them up with any of their beers and not have to wait until they get a small keg back from a customer. I can also fit 2 Cornelius kegs on each side for 10 gallons on each side rather than one 7.75-gallon keg, so I can have a cold spare keg ready when one runs out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/7223166934/"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5346/7223166934_a823ac86be.jpg" alt="IMG_2317" /></a></p>

<p><img src="http://troyandgay.wordpress.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>But the kegerator has the standard Sankey keg tap and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_keg">Cornelius kegs</a> (“Corny kegs”) have ball-lock taps. I want to be able to use either keg without having to unassemble and then reassemble the tubing. Not only would it take too much time, I’d have to make sure that there aren’t any leaks each time I assemble it. You’d think there would be some quick-connect device that would make this possible, but there isn’t. You have to make it yourself.</p>

<p>I started off thinking I’d make two sets of taps with couplers so I could swap the taps in and out with just a wrench. It wouldn’t be quick-change, but it’d be faster and easier than undoing and redoing a bunch of clamps and barbed ends. While looking for parts, I found the brilliant setup shown in <a href="http://forum.northernbrewer.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=72024&amp;start=0#p717984">Toby’s post</a> in Northern Brewer’s forums. It converts a Sankey tap to a tap that has ball-lock connectors on each side, effectively turning regular kegs into Cornelius kegs. Then I replaced the barbed clamp fitting with ball-lock connectors on the CO2 and beer lines.</p>

<p>The entire system has permanent connections so once it’s leak-free, it’s leak-free for good. The only parts that become disconnected and re-connected are the ball-lock connectors. But because ball-lock connectors are made to be quickly connected and unconnected, I can take them off and on without any tools and without worrying that I have a leak or finding my CO2 tank unexpectedly empty.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>I was looking forward to going to Mexico again, not having been there in 4 years. And I thought we’d explore the old town Puerto Vallarta that we only discovered last time on our way to the airport.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p><img src="http://troyandgay.wordpress.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>We got up at 4am for our 6am flight. The kids slept in their clothes so we could get out of the house as quickly as possible. They woke up easy (and we woke <em>them</em> for a change!) and we were on our way by 4:30am. It was still dark and the streets were empty and the kids got a kick out of that. When we got to San Francisco and tried to unpack the stroller I realized that the TSA in Seattle didn’t give us one of the wheels to the stroller. So we’d be carrying <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2009/05/03/phil-teds-dash-inline-buggy-review/">that damn stroller</a> all the way to Mexico and back for no reason. Stupid TSA – they even made the kids, including Eva, take off their shoes, which is <em>not</em> required.</p>

<p>The flights were on-time and we got to Mexico at 1pm local time (2 hours ahead of Seattle’s timezone). It was hot! We got our rental car, a Jeep Wrangler Unlimited, and got to our place by 2pm. Our concierge and groceries were waiting for us at the house, so I immediately opened a Negra Modelo and noticed that the concierge was able to find Maker’s Mark, which was not possible <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2008/02/01/mexico-vacation/">the last time we were in Mexico</a>. The kids immediately got in the pool. It was a good start to the vacation.</p>

<p>On Monday, we went to the <a href="http://www.zoologicodevallarta.com/zooi.html">Vallarta Zoo</a> because we heard that you could feed and pet the animals. It took 90 minutes to drive the 50km or so because the “highway” is so slow, you have to go through slow-moving Puerto Vallarta and the road from there to the zoo was under construction. We were hungry and found a fish tacos place in the tiny town of Mismaloya for lunch.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/7158095098/"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5038/7158095098_a1d1a29185.jpg" alt="Lunch In Mismaloya" /></a></p>

<p>We got to the zoo, paid $200 (!) for 4 of us to take the tour, which includes a bag of food to give the animals. The whole place was pretty sketchy and the animals were in tiny enclosures and didn’t look very happy. But the kids didn’t notice the difference and they could get very close and fed some of the animals.</p>

<p>[flickr video=7165059068 secret=18499ce2ce w=400 h=225]</p>

<p>On Wednesday, we went to Sayulita for lunch. We went there last time and really liked it, so I was looking forward to spending the day there. I started feeling bad in the morning and during the drive there I got worse. We had shrimp for dinner the night before and, although Gay ate some too, I ate more and I think that did it. By the time we sat down for lunch, the thought of eating anything made me feel worse, so I skipped lunch. We went to get ice cream for the kids after lunch but I was feeling so bad I just wanted to go home and lay down. We did and I slept most of that afternoon, in between doses of Pepto-Bismol. I was back to normal Thursday morning.</p>

<p>On Friday, we went to Dolphin Adventure. I was expecting something as low-rent as the zoo, but I was pleased to find a well-run professional place. Gay had signed us up for the swimming with the dolphins for young kids. The kids got life jackets on and after a short briefing on the park, dolphins and how to touch them, we all got in the pool. Hudson hated his life jacket so we took it off. Gay held Havana and I held Hudson as the trainer went through his program. We got to pet the dolphin several times, feed it fish and feel it swim by us – they can move! – and give them the signal to jump. It was fun, but the kids were a little scared and it was difficult to get them to pet the dolphin.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/7243887618/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7102/7243887618_0c41352741.jpg" alt="MISAEL (46)" /></a></p>

<p>I didn’t eat much the last few days, still uneasy about getting sick before a day of flying. By Sunday, I was ready to get home. Hot hot temperature, too much chips and guacamole, bland beer and food poisoning makes Mexico not my kind of place. I realized that we’ve been to Mexico six times, more than any country we’ve been to. I’m done with Mexico for a long time, I think.</p>

<p>I was very happy to be home in Seattle. Seattle Beer Week had just started and I needed a vacation from my vacation, so I spent the next week relaxing, Gay and I went to a couple Seattle Beer Week events where we met people from <a href="http://www.blackravenbrewing.com/">Black Raven Brewing</a> and the owners of <a href="http://nakedcitybrewing.com/">Naked City</a>, we stained the back fence and we barbecued dinner every night with wonderful (warm, not hot) weather all week. That week was more enjoyable to me than the week in Mexico! It was a solid reminder of why I love Seattle so much: my kind of weather, a city with plenty to do and the best beer in the world.</p>
