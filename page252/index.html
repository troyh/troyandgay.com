            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_1996.jpg" alt="IMG_1996.jpg" />We rode to Seminyak this morning from Ubud. The drive took about 45 minutes, although if there was no traffic on the roads, it’d have taken maybe 15. Driving in Bali is pretty tough due to the masses of motorcycles and mopeds on the roads. Cars are constantly passing them, so it’s almost like there’s 3 lanes in the road which makes head-on collisions seem inevitable.</p>

<p>Along the way we ran into a procession to a cremation ceremony, so we pulled over and snapped a few photos. From what we understand, everyone is cremated in Indonesia and then the ashes are buried in cemeteries. When someone dies, they spend three days preparing the grounds for the ceremony and then the entire town gets dressed up and marches to the cremation grounds where the cremation is done. In contrast to western funerals, Indonesian funerals are lively events.</p>

<p>Speaking of non-western Indonesian customs, we’ve learned that Indonesians don’t make a big deal out of meals. In fact, families don’t eat meals together – the mother typically prepares food and leaves it in the kitchen all day for family members to eat when they want to. One of the expats we met told us that if you’re invited to a Indonesian’s house for dinner, the food is served buffet-style and you take some and eat it by yourself, usually in the corner. Very strange. I thought all cultures made food a key part of social events. It just goes to show that there’s an exception to every rule.</p>

<p>We arrived at our hotel, <a href="http://www.oberoihotels.com/resortdetails.asp?hi_id=19&amp;hotelcode=TXL-OB-HBDPSOB&amp;hl_id=5">The Oberoi</a>. Now this is a hotel! Even better than the Four Seasons, I think. And we once again have the privacy we wanted that we didn’t really have in Ubud. This should be a relaxing way to end our honeymoon. :)  The only drawback is the lack of WiFi internet in the room, we have to go to the “library” to get internet access. But we still have dialup through <a href="http://www.telkom.net.id/">TelkomNet</a>, which seems to provide free dialup to everyone – we’re using the same phone number, account name and password that they provide on their site. Free dialup internet in Indonesia. Go figure.</p>

<p>A nice thing about Seminyak is that we can walk into town and to the restaurants and shops. No scheduling a driver here. And it sounds like there’s lots of good restaurants here, including a <a href="http://www.indomykonos.com/">Greek restaurant</a> that we’ve heard good things about.</p>

After a morning of lounging by the pool (again), we went to the Monkey Forest in Ubud. I was hesitant to go to see the monkeys because I thought it was soooo touristy and would be disappointing. But it was incredibly fun! I’ve seen monkeys on TV, of course, but nothing compares to seeing them in real life… it struck me how human they behave. It’s those opposable thumbs that make all the difference!</p>

<p>We bought bananas to feed them and boy do they go after them. The young ones are aggressive in the way they grab them from you (they have to be quick, or the big monkeys win) but the older monkeys are very polite – you can just hand it to them. Not thinking, I assumed I had to peel the bananas for them and the first monkey was not patient while I did that so Gay explained that they know how to peel the banana. And they do… they peel it just like a human, it’s just amazing to watch.
We took almost 100 photos and a few mini-movies, we couldn’t get enough. We can’t post them all here yet, but when we get back we will.</p>

<p>Then we stopped in at the <a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/forward.weml?property_name=sayan&amp;">Four Seasons in Sayan</a> for a drink just to see what it was like. From the rooftop (a lotus pond) we could see the villa we were staying in. And the bar itself was beautifully designed.</p>

<p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_1974.jpg" alt="IMG_1974.jpg" /></p>

<p>Then back to Nuri’s for dinner, a delicious steak, and we met even more expats, one from the US even. The Canadian guy living in Bali, when he heard we are from Seattle, gave us an earful about Microsoft and their “crappy products that never work”. I always find it interesting to experience the visceral negative reaction to Microsoft among non-tech people. He was embarrassed, but still adamant, when he found out we used to work at Microsoft, but was happy to hear we use Macs (he’s a film documentary-maker so he uses Macs to edit his video) . ;) An Australian, who seemed half-insane, was fun to listen to. And Brian was an hospitable host once again. :) If you go to Nuri’s, ask what isn’t on the menu because we found out after we had dinner that they also serve cheesesteaks!</p>

            <p>We’re both getting tired of Ubud. So we spent most of the day at the villa by the pool and reading. Fortunately, the chainsaws were only running part of the day. We went into Ubud for lunch and came right back home for more nothing-doing. And it was a humid day with little or no breeze. I was sweating just sitting in a chair and couldn’t drink enough water. This is DC-style humidity. I’m ready to see the beach (and the breeze off the water) again.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Instead of calling our driver, we walked into Ubud from the villa. It’s not a terribly long walk, but the lack of a sidewalk, the uneven road surface and the hot humid weather makes it feel long. We happened across Naughty Nuri’s, a place that we had read about in a local book that is unique because they sell martinis. Martinis, and cocktails in general, are very rare in Bali. It was hot, we were tired of walking and it was lunch time so we decided to stop in to see how good the martinis really are.</p>

<p>The glasses came out of the freezer and put on the table in front of us and then the waitress poured from the shaker into our glasses, right to the rim. The exactness of the measuring was a marvel in itself. Another drop in either glass would have overflowed the glass.</p>

<p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_1868.jpg" alt="IMG_1868.jpg" /></p>

<p>As we were finishing our lunch and martini, the owner sat down at our table and asked us how we liked the martinis. An hour or so later, we heard his story, the story of the restaurant and discovered that some friends of his lived in the Seattle area (an island off the coast of Olympia). He called his friends and I got on the phone to talk to him. He and his wife run a salt business in Bali and knew the <a href="http://seasalt.com">Salt Works</a> people we know in Seattle. Small world.</p>

<p>Brian, the owner of Naught Nuri’s, is a New Yorker who one day decided to leave his brother-in-law’s successful car business and travel in Asia. He found Bali and decided to make it a home. He met Nuri, a Balinese woman, got married, opened the restaurant and had a kid. He’s been here for 10 years now and his kid, who we met, is 3.</p>

<p>We had some beers (draft Bintang!) and then walked down the street and did some shopping before returning to Nuri’s for another drink. By this time, it was getting crowded and we realized that Nuri’s is a hangout for expats. We met a German guy, a Canadian guy and an Australian guy (who demanded to know what is so naughty about Nuri) all who lived in Bali at least part of the year.</p>

<p>They also helped explain some of the questions we had about Bali and its people. They even have an acronym for some of the unexplainable behavior of Indonesians: ILF, Indonesian Logic Fatigue. :)  Of the things we learned, we discovered, at least according to Brian, that although kids all go to school, reading is not a priority. Many kids get out of school still not able to read. No explanation other than ILF.</p>

<p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_1877.jpg" alt="IMG_1877.jpg" /></p>

<p>We went home and found our crew of three cooking for dinner. The previous night we told them to make enough food for everyone and asked that they eat dinner with us. But the table was only set for two when we arrived. So we set three more places at the table and helped serve everything. The idea was that we would get to know them, but we only learned how shy three young (22, 22 and 19) Balinese kids can be. :)  About the only thing we learned besides their ages were that Nyoman went to school to be a chef and wanted to be a professional chef. Ketut and Wayan weren’t able to tell us what their plans were.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>I thought this debate was far more lopsided in Kerry’s favor than the first presidential debate, but the polls so far show it much closer. Did anyone see Kerry’s complete command of the facts and figures while Bush continued to just make platitudes?! Maybe I’m biased after Bush referred to web sites as “the internets”. ;)</p>

<p>One thing that struck me was when Bush said “I was not happy when they didn’t find any [WMDs]”. Why was he unhappy? If he was so concerned that Iraq was putting WMDs into the hands of the terrorists they harbored, wouldn’t he be ecstatic that his fears were unwarranted? For someone who claims to be protecting our country, I am terrified that he <em>wanted</em> WMDs to be found.</p>

<p>And when Bush said “I’m a good steward of the environment”…. WOW…. did <em>anyone</em> fall for that?!</p>

<p>Bush said he would only pick a Supreme Court judge who interprets the Constitution and then went on to say that he wouldn’t pick a judge who would remove “Under God” from the pledge of allegiance. Hey Bush, that ruling was made from a strict interpretation of the Constitution, you know, the whole “separation of church and state” that is pretty central to the Constitution. And citing the Dred Scott case as an example of what he doesn’t want our Supreme Court to do? Good to know that Bush doesn’t support slavery. I’m with him there. But was he trying to imply that Kerry is for slavery?</p>

<p>When asked specifically for three examples of mistakes he made, Bush couldn’t name a single one. Crikey.</p>

<p>And Kerry, when Bush criticized the UN for not being able to get Hussein out of power, said:</p>

<p><em>The goal of the sanctions was not to remove Saddam Hussein, it was to remove the weapons of mass destruction. And, Mr. President, just yesterday the Duelfer report told you and the whole world they worked. He didn’t have weapons of mass destruction, Mr. President. That was the objective. And if we’d used smart diplomacy, we could have saved $200 billion and an invasion of Iraq. And right now, Osama bin Laden might be in jail or dead. That’s the war against terror.</em></p>

<p>In other words, if we were smart, we’d be $200 billion richer, Iraq would still be powerless and bin Laden wouldn’t still be bombing hotels in Egypt. But, of course, Bush still won’t say what he wants to say: that kicking Saddam out of power <em>was</em> his objective.</p>
