              <p>Gee, the DoJ now thinks that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/business/business-microsoft-settlement.html?ex=1372651200&amp;en=ed5323401b6ba604&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">Microsoft is not complying with the settlement</a>. I suspect the next we hear from <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/kotelly-bio.html">Colleen Kollar-Kotelly</a> will be something like “Ok, Microsoft, I said I might slap you on the wrist for the grievous crimes you committed. Now I just might threaten to make that threat again.”</p>

<p>Kollar-Kotelly is a moron. In the settlement, she actually used the word “reasonable” in describing the fees Microsoft can charge competitors to see the source code. That’s lawyer-ese for “absolutely anything you want”. So Microsoft charged outrageous fees.</p>

<p>Just to give a quick history… Microsoft settled the original case against them in 1995. They broke that settlement and ended up in this new antitrust case. They lost the case but the DoJ decided to have another settlement. And they’re now surprised that they’re breaking this one? I think I see a pattern here.</p>

              <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/letour2003.gif" alt="letour2003.gif" />I’m getting excited about the <a href="http://www.letour.fr/indexus.html">Tour de France</a> that starts this weekend. Lance Armstrong is being <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=ap-tour-armstrong&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns">his usual modest self</a> and <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-dc&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns">trying to stay calm</a>. I think <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-toursimoni_sports_feature&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns">Simoni</a> is his biggest threat, but <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-tourullrich_sports_feature&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns">Ullrich</a> may be closer to his top form of ‘97 (which was amazing) and <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-tourbotero_sports_feature&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns">Botero</a> will be interesting to watch. Last  year, I thought he had it sewn up from the start, but I have a feeling this year could be more difficult.</p>

              <p>Call me dumb, but I just came to a realization as to why the Mac is so much easier to use than Windows. It’s simply business. Any businessperson can tell you that you build your product to meet your customers’ needs. The customer for Windows is not the consumer, it’s <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?search=OEM&amp;go=Go">OEM</a>s. Microsoft sells very few copies of Windows on store shelves, the overwhelming majority of revenue comes from those who ship Windows on their computers – OEMs like Dell, Compaq, Gateway, etc. However, the customer for the Mac <strong>is</strong> the consumer because Apple doesn’t have OEMs, they have to build their product to appeal to the consumer. So that’s why you see an incredible number of features and customization in Windows that OEMs want/need (but that consumers don’t need or want) that get in the way, but the Mac is designed so suit the consumer.</p>

<p>It seems so obvious, but in all my years in the industry, I’ve never seen anyone put it this way. As a former Microsoft employee, I don’t even think that the employees realize this. The natural assumption is that Microsoft is just very bad at design and Apple is very good at it. I still think that’s true, but it’s true because Microsoft has no need to be good at design – the OEMs aren’t complaining about poor design.</p>

The quality of iChat + iSight is stunning. I’ve done video conferences with people on high-end equipment before and this is far better both in sound and picture quality. The video quality still isn’t TV quality, but it is close and does 30 frames per second (which is what TV does). I have seen the future of telecommunication and this is it.</p>

<p>Now I just wish I knew more people with Macs to chat with. <img src="/img/smile.gif" alt="" /></p>
