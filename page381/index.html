Ouzo got so much exercise <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/ouzoswim.mov">swimming</a>, he could barely keep his eyes open.</p>

          <p>Saw the widely-acclaimed <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/movies/reviews/movie/1688385">8 Mile</a> last night. I was worried that it would be full of macho rapping (Disclaimer: I’m not a rap fan <em>at all</em>) like the 80s break-dancing movies and the 70s roller-skating/disco movies were, but it wasn’t, in fact there was very little rapping. That was good. The rest of the movie wasn’t. Boring story – you see the end coming from 8 miles away. Eminem basically played himself, except that his character is anti-violence, pro-civil rights, and get this, he’s a caring guy always trying to do what’s best for females. Remember, Eminem is the nitwit who has been up on <a href="http://www.freep.com/news/metro/rap8_20000608.htm">gun and assault charges</a> and raps about violence against women, Jews, Blacks and homosexuals. Maybe he is a good actor?</p>

          <p>For our first “day off” in I don’t know how long, we drove out to <a href="http://www.ptguide.com/">Port Townsend</a> for the day. Had lunch at a brewpub in downtown Port Townsend, walked around and then took the dogs to the beach where Ouzo learned to swim.</p>

          <p>Lance uncharacteristically <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-armstrongrumsas&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns">criticizes another cyclist</a> (although he’s probably right) and <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-dc&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns">maintained his lead</a> in the Dauphiné-Libéré despite falling off his bike 9 miles into today’s stage. It always amazes me when a cyclist can crash at 30-40MPH and then get back on the bike and finish racing.</p>
