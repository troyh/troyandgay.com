            <p>It’s been a busy week… yesterday we went into Seattle to put a server back after replacing the CPU fan that died on it. It’s nice to have so much redundancy and be able to just slipstream a new server in to distribute the load or to take one out to upgrade it without affecting anything. Just a couple years ago, the entire site was run on one machine. Now it runs on nine servers (3 web servers, 2 database servers, 2 load-balancers and one backup load balancer and one NFS server)!</p>

<p>Before coming home, we had an Indian buffet at <a href="http://www.alkibeach.com/eatsdetail.asp?eatsID=38">a West Seattle restaurant</a>. Yum! We’ve eaten there several times but yesterday was especially good.</p>

<p>We finally saw <a href="http://www.italianjobmovie.com/flash/index.html">The Italian Job</a> last night. I loved it! There was some dumb computer cracker stuff in it (the skill of a computer cracker is not that they can think up people’s passwords and retry them til they get in), as usual these days, but it didn’t annoy me that much this time. It was a very entertaining movie, and I love the <a href="http://www.mini.com/">Mini</a>s! We also saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243133/">The Man Who Wasn’t There</a> this week. Not worth the time.</p>

<p>The house is <em>still</em> being painted but it’s very close to being done. It’s just trim and touch-ups now. And it’s been a very cold week, in the 30s which is bitter cold for Seattle. I’ve avoided getting sick at least (can’t say that for Gay, though). I feel sorry for the painter who has to be outside all day long. But Ouzo just loves hanging out with him all day.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.internetnews.com/ec-news/article.php/3105761">Barnes &amp; Noble</a> wants to take over barnesandnoble.com. Why they weren’t the same company in the first place was a stupid mistake, but B&amp;N management got caught up in the internet craze and thought that the brick &amp; mortar chain would hurt their dot-com-ness. If anything, it would help. Now they have to pay $200 million to get back the company they funded in the first place. Oh well. Maybe now I can order a book from bn.com and return it at the local store.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=7239">What do the presidential candidates run for their web sites?</a> I’m sure you could guess just based on political leanings of each party. But even more interesting, the Republican National Committee web site runs Microsoft software and the Democratic National Committee web site runs Apache on Linux and the difference in reliability (measured in how often the site needs to be rebooted) is striking: 4.26 days for the RNC and 445 days for the DNC. What I’d really like to know is how much money each spent on their sites so we can have a price/performance ratio of Republicans versus Democrats. And if you are a rich Republican, good news… the IRS has a <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8302.pdf">new form</a> that you can use to get your million-dollar tax refund more quickly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2003/nov/06itunes.html">iTunes outselling Napster</a> 5-to-1 in the first week. This goes against all the “analysts” who said Napster would be the winner. As usual, analysts go by hype instead of facts. Napster’s users are kids and kids don’t purchase music online or offline. iTunes’ users are adults with more disposable income, who do purchase music. iTunes now has 80% marketshare (up from 70%). <a href="http://www.macboy.com/cartoons/ballmer/">Even Steve Ballmer did an iPod commercial</a>.</p>

            <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/wallpaper.reputation.jpg" alt="wallpaper.reputation.jpg" />I wish we had a reason (and could afford) to use <a href="http://www.veer.com">Veer Stock Photos and Fonts</a>.  This company makes great stuff and their catalog is pure eye candy.  The nice thing is they offer some of <a href="http://www.veer.com/ideas/wallpaper/">their designs as free wallpaper</a>, which I’ve been using for a few months.  I thought I’d give them a plug.</p>
