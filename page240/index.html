            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>We bought a  house in 2001 that was built in 1993 with windows from a company called <a href="http://milgard.com/">Milgard Windows</a>. A few of the windows in the house have condensation between the two panes of glass. But Milgard Windows have a <a href="http://milgard.com/about-milgard/lifetime-guarantee.asp">Lifetime Guarantee</a> so this should be no problem to have fixed.</p>

<p>Wrong. It turns out, that Milgard’s “Lifetime guarantee” only lasts as long as the purchaser owns the house. So the day we bought the house, the lifetime guarantee ended. No one died, the windows are still in the house, so what’s the “life” part of “lifetime”?!</p>

<p>We found this out after we bought new Milgard windows for our office remodel. So having learned a lesson from the old window warranty, we want to make sure these new windows are covered as much as possible. Obviously, Milgard will find any reason to void the warranty so we figured we’d better have our documentation on the purchase with the warranty information we were given.</p>

<p>But we weren’t given a receipt for the windows, just a bill from the contractor for the windows. So we asked for a real receipt. Of course, they said that’s easy and had the distributor get us the receipt. We got a faxed receipt (no original copy) with the prices whited-out. Hmmm. We called the distributor and explained that we want a receipt and were told we can’t have one.</p>

<p>And then we get an angry email from our contractor telling us that our “rather bizarre” request is impossible. It’s impossible to get a receipt for a purchase?! The construction industry is looking pretty shady to us at this point.</p>

              <p>Ron came by this morning, agreed that the outlets looked terrible, and agreed to fix them at his cost. The new version is <em>much</em> better. The rest of the trim was finished and caulked, so we can start painting as soon as we decide on colors.

              <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//screwyoutlets.jpg" alt="screwyoutlets.jpg" />The construction guys returned to put the trim around the windows and the walls. They didn’t finish the window trim and a little of the wall trim so they’ll be back tomorrow. And because the electricians put the outlets too high on the wall below the windows, they had to make really ugly cutouts to go around them. They were supposed to be flush-mounted on the trim but Ron didn’t explain that to the electricians so now we have the ugliest wall outlets in town (see inset). We’re going to have a talk with Ron about a solution to this…</p>

<p>We’re also still trying to decide on colors. Melinda, who is an ex-interior designer, came over last night and helped us pick out some colors, of which there are samples you can see painted on the walls.</p>

<p>After tomorrow and once we decide on paint, we can start painting. Then it’s just flooring (carpet) installation and put the plates on the electrical outlets and getting the wall heaters installed. My guess is that we can move in mid-December six weeks after the “two-week” project started.</p>

              <p><img src="http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=60034572&amp;trkid=14" alt="" />Finally saw <em>Shrek 2</em> this weekend but we didn’t like it as much as the first one. The story just wasn’t as entertaining. The cultural references weren’t that striking, as many reviews said. Yeah, it was cute that the fast food place was named “Fryar’s” and Far Far Away Land was obviously Los Angeles.</p>

<p>We watched the extras on the DVD and about how much more advanced technically than the first one, but you know what? I didn’t even notice. I wasn’t amazed that the characters got stuck in a rain shower and got drenched, something “never before done” in a computer-animated movie. All I remember about that scene was thinking “what was the purpose of that rain shower?”</p>

<p>It was entertaining and funny and worth watching, but I really liked the first movie and this one didn’t do it for me as much.</p>
