              <p>“Obama fired GM CEO Wagoner”:http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2009/03/29/obama-to-gm-ceo-wagoner-youre-fired/! To all those who defend Wagoner as a great CEO… I am sure I could take the #1 car-maker in the world, lose two-thirds of my marketshare in a few years, lose money on every single car I make, invest in things that people have said for decades they don’t want and drive the company into bankruptcy. That must make me a great CEO too, so if you were happy with Wagoner, please hire me and pay me millions a year to do it to your company. And if I can’t kill your company faster than Wagoner killed GM, I will only take half the $20 million bonus GM is paying him to leave.</p>

<p>To all those who think the federal government shouldn’t be running GM, I agree that would be bad. It’s so bad that the only thing worse than the Federal Government running GM is GM running GM.</p>

<p>Obama quickly realized Rick Wagoner is a loser as a CEO. And he knows that Chrysler is worthless so he’s forcing them to either merge with Fiat or go out of business. I’d still prefer that both companies be left to die, but given that Obama wants to at least help GM survive, this is the best/smartest thing he could do. Hopefully, GM will go through bankruptcy, get rid of the unions and come out stronger. But I doubt it and it will likely be a waste of tax dollars to try. Let’s hope I’m wrong.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of hand-wringing about the poor union employees who will lose their jobs if GM goes away. But they only have themselves to blame. They strike for contract negotiations, higher salaries, better benefits, etc. every few years but they’ve never once had a strike to protest GM’s bungling management and their designing cars that suck. Had they stood up and refused to build gas-guzzling Hummers when Wagoner bought the company or had they stood up and demanded that Wagoner not kill off the wildly-popular electric car, the EV-1, and been ahead of the game, they’d all have safe jobs.</p>

              <p>We drove to Portland to “The Nines”:http://www.starwoodhotels.com/luxury/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=1757 hotel to stay there for a couple nights.</p>

<p>The Nines is a new Portland luxury hotel but they’re suffering so Gay got a good deal on a suite (there’s positives to economic downturns!), which is the only type of room to stay in with kids who go to bed at 7pm.</p>

<p>Our room wasn’t ready when we got there so the hotel sent us to the bar to wait with free cocktails. After moving into the room, we went back to the Deschutes Public House for dinner, which is a very comfortable place to take tired kids.</p>

              <p>We left Sunday morning for a long drive up to Ashland, Oregon. I was expecting to arrive in Ashland, eat dinner at a Subway or something and go to bed early in a lousy hotel. The lousy hotel was right, but we discovered that Ashland has a nice little brewpub, “The Standing Stone Brewing Co”:http://www.standingstonebrewing.com/. This was a nice place to go after a long day of driving, but Hudson was very tired and cranky, which is unusual for him. That made dinner less fun. Of the sample set of beers, we both liked the Belgian Saison and I liked the Double IPA.</p>

              <p>After a week I’ve realized that San Francisco is not a beer town, despite being the birthplace for American craft brewing. Grocery stores have a very limited beer selection, far more limited than even Vashon’s Thriftway, and restaurants have only a handful of beers on tap, most of which are mainstream beers. And if you do want beer you’d better not have kids because the beer bars don’t allow kids.</p>

<p>We drove around San Francisco for a while and then, on the recommendation from the hotel concierge, went to “Izzy’s Steak House”:http://www.izzyssteaks.com/.</p>

<p>Fortunately, of the five beers on tap, Izzy’s had Denogginizer, a double IPA from “Drake’s Brewing”:http://www.drinkdrakes.com/home.html, a small brewer from California that I’ve never even heard of. I ordered that and it was very good.</p>

<p>We went back to the hotel and stopped at the Ghirardelli ice cream shop in <a href="http://www.ghirardellisq.com/ghirardellisq/food.php?id=16">Ghirardelli Square</a> for some ice cream for Havana, which made her very excited. She had two small spoons of it and didn’t want any more. Go figure.</p>
