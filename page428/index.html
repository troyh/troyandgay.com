            <p><a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/">Doc Searls</a> and David Weinberger wrote <a href="http://www.worldofends.com/">World of Ends</a> that explains why the internet is so useful. It’s all been said before in various places, but this is a concise version.</p>

            <p>It sure feels like they’re closing in on bin Laden. <strike>They've now [captured](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;ncid=578&amp;e=2&amp;cid=578&amp;u=/nm/20030307/ts_nm/attack_qaeda_dc) 2 of his (50?) sons and killed other Al-Qaeda dorks.</strike> I bet they kill or capture bin Laden this month. But I hope they capture him and we can see pathetic pictures of him like we did his buddy.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I guess they didn’t really capture 2 of his sons. How do these rumors get started??</p>

            <p>I happened across <a href="http://taxes.yahoo.com/filing.html">TurboTax for the web</a> today. We need more web applications and this is a perfect application for the web – it’s always up-to-date data-wise, bugs can be fixed immediately, no downloads necessary, etc. The only downside is that you’re giving a corporation (Intuit) very personal info about yourself, which is not usually a good idea. But I wish QuickBooks and Quicken were also web apps (Quicken is well on its way already, though).</p>

            <p>TiVo <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rc/030306/tech_tivo_earns_1.html">announced quarterly earnings</a> today. They’re still  losing money ($21 million for the year) but they’re growing and now have 624,000 subscribers. I believe their goal is 1 million by the end of the year. I can’t wait til they ship the <a href="http://tivo.com/4.9.asp">Home Media Option</a> so I can view my <a href="http://apple.com/iphoto/">iPhoto</a> pics and listen to my <a href="http://apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> music through TiVo.</p>

<p>And I wish they’d start competing with Netflix. They now have the tools to deliver almost-on-demand movies. I’d pay for that!</p>

            <p><a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> is <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/03/03/06/1548245.shtml?tid=124">adding</a> to their subscription offering. Now, you get access to new stories 10-20 minutes before non-subscribers. I like Slashdot and could be convinced to pay for it, but is this the best they can do for subscribers? Slashdot is late as it is. I find the news from RSS feeds and <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire">NetNewsWire</a> long before Slashdot gets it posted, sometimes by a day or two (!) – 10-20 minutes is not a great benefit.</p>

<p>Why don’t they offer useful services like a summary of the week’s news along with the highly-moderated discussions posts (not everyone reads Slashdot 5 times a day), more customized news filtering, email notifications of specific articles, etc.</p>
