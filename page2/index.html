<p>Gay’s mom, and my favorite mother-in-law, is in town this week. She likes to have a fancy dinner when she comes to Seattle so we made reservations at the Space Needle restaurant. She was last at the Space Needle during the <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_21_Exposition">World’s Fair in 1962,</a> which it was built for. It’s a work-of-art, it still looks modern and futuristic 52 years later! The kids have never been there. I think I was last there in 1997. </p>

<p>I don’t like touristy stuff but it was a lot of fun, it didn’t feel very touristy. The restaurant revolves a full turn every 45 minutes, which the kids thought was super-cool, so the view is constantly changing and it’s a view of Seattle you don’t see often. We live in a beautiful city, I never tire of seeing the mountains, water, architecture, greenery, etc. </p>

<p>After dinner, we went to the observation deck which has these cool touch screens that show a 360° view and let you go to any date and time and even watch time-lapse videos: </p>

<p>(Even more impressive, it was made by Microsoft!)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.empmuseum.org">EMP Museum</a> is near the Space Needle:</p>

<p>I’ve always thought that the EMP, despite being designed by <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gehry">Frank Gehry</a>, is an eyesore from a distance, so much that I’ve avoided ever going to it. But up close it looks great. One day I’ll have to go. </p>

<p>Havana lost not one, but two!, teeth today. Gerene actually pulled them out for her. Havana decided to try an experiment: she told Gerene, Hudson and Eva not to tell me or Gay so she could see if the Tooth Fairy showed up. She has been suspicious that the Tooth Fairy is not real and that it is her parents that leave the note and money. </p>

<p><img src="/img/IMG_5367.JPG" alt="Title" /></p>

<p>Impressively, she and her brother and sister kept it a secret all day and evening. The next morning, she announced that she knows the Tooth Fairy is real because she did visit! Her <em>scientific method</em> makes me proud. And she was very happy to have her belief in the Tooth Fairy restored. </p>

<p>It’s been 4 months since <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2014/11/15/Havana-lost%20another%20tooth.html">she lost her 8th tooth</a>. </p>

<p>Gay wanted to have her 45th birthday party at the brewery but it’s not ready yet. While <a href="https://twitter.com/troy_h/status/579691093123473408">at brunch this morning</a>, we decided to have a few friends over to the brewery for a miniature party instead. Jon, Megan, Dierdre and Patrick joined us and the kids for some beer and pizza tonight. </p>

<p><img src="/img/IMG_5353.JPG" alt="Title" /></p>

<p>The kids got to climb up to the mezzanine and run around — they quickly became ladder experts. </p>

<p><img src="/img/IMG_5358.JPG" alt="Title" /></p>

<p>It got cold at the building so we went home for cake and shuffleboard. </p>
