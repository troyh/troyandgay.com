<p>Havana lost not one, but two!, teeth today. Gerene actually pulled them out for her. Havana decided to try an experiment: she told Gerene, Hudson and Eva not to tell me or Gay so she could see if the Tooth Fairy showed up. She has been suspicious that the Tooth Fairy is not real and that it is her parents that leave the note and money. </p>

<p><img src="/img/IMG_5367.JPG" alt="Title" /></p>

<p>Impressively, she and her brother and sister kept it a secret all day and evening. The next morning, she announced that she knows the Tooth Fairy is real because she did visit! Her <em>scientific method</em> makes me proud. And she was very happy to have her belief in the Tooth Fairy restored. </p>

<p>It’s been 4 months since <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2014/11/15/Havana-lost%20another%20tooth.html">she lost her 8th tooth</a>. </p>

<p>Gay wanted to have her 45th birthday party at the brewery but it’s not ready yet. While <a href="https://twitter.com/troy_h/status/579691093123473408">at brunch this morning</a>, we decided to have a few friends over to the brewery for a miniature party instead. Jon, Megan, Dierdre and Patrick joined us and the kids for some beer and pizza tonight. </p>

<p>The kids got to climb up to the mezzanine and run around — they quickly became ladder experts. </p>

<p>It got cold at the building so we went home for cake and shuffleboard. </p>

<p>Watching <a href="Link">Maps to the Stars</a> starring Julianne Moore as a character named “Havana”. Hey, <em>we</em> invented naming people Havana! I knew I should’ve trademarked the name. </p>

<p>Too bad the movie wasn’t very good. </p>

Eva got her first bicycle today at <a href="http://www.montlakebike.com/">Montlake Bicycle Shop</a> and this weekend I installed our bike wall in the mud room. I put 2 sheets of <a href="http://www.sabic-ip.com/gep/Plastics/en/ProductsAndServices/ProductLine/lexan.html">Lexan</a> on the wall to protect it from wet/dirty tires and mounted 5 hooks to hold the bikes and keep them out of the way.</p>

<p>The kids are amazed that the bikes “stick” to the wall.</p>
