          </h3>
            <p>Last night we ordered room service, got suckered into watching <em>Britain’s Got Talent</em> and saw Susan Boyle <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6400081.ece">come in 2nd</a> to the most ridiculous dance troupe I think I’ve ever seen (Britain has talent, they just don’t know they do, I guess), packed our suitcases and got the kids to bed at a reasonable time so we could be checked-out by 9am to catch the train at 10am. We were in the taxi and on our way a few minutes early so we made it to Paddington Station in plenty of time to wait for our train.</p>

<p>The train left right on time; it was scheduled to leave at 9:57am and at 9:57am we were leaving the station. In America, no one would have bet that train would have left before noon. We rode through the English countryside and by 12:30pm we were in Exeter and getting into a taxi to take us to Bovey Castle in Dartmoor National Park.</p>

<p>It’s a 45 minute drive to Bovey so we asked the taxi driver to stop on the way so we could get lunch. His recommendation was Pizza Hut. That’s an indication of how bad the food would be on the way. We didn’t take his recommendation and ended up at a little family pub in Moretonhampstead. The food was not very good, Gay’s grilled “stuffed chicken breast” (meaning it had stuffing on the side) was inedible but I could at least eat my minced beef with onion and gravy with a puff pastry, but not the potatoes. After lunch, we got back in the taxi and rode the windy road through the hills to <a href="http://www.boveycastle.com/">Bovey Castle</a>. Havana fell fast asleep in my arms, so she got a short afternoon nap.</p>

<p>After getting assistance from the staff to pay the taxi driver since we didn’t  have enough cash, we checked-in and were given a tour of the place by the friendly staff. We relaxed in our room and then went to dinner at the casual restaurant in the castle. We had a much better dinner than we did lunch and ate on the balcony of the castle overlooking the grounds and the hills.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>After 4 years, we finally visited the Fuller’s Brewery. When we visited London in 2005 our taxi from Heathrow went right by it but because of the terrorist bombings that day, the brewery was closed to the public all week. So we left London without visiting. But today we finally made the trek out to Chiswick. I’ve been to a lot of breweries in the US, but the oldest, I think, dates back to the early 1980s. This brewery has been here for <a href="http://www.fullers.co.uk/rte.asp?id=34">over 350 years</a> (it became Fuller’s in 1845).</p>

<p>It’s not that far, just a half-dozen stops and one transfer on the Tube, a 15-minute walk through Turnham Green to Chiswick and there it is. We had lunch at the Mawson Arms, the pub at the brewery. The food was nothing special, although Havana really liked her egg salad sandwich (she <em>loves</em> eggs!). But the ESBs we had were the freshest we’ve had yet and you could tell they were fresh because even on a handpump they had some carbonation.</p>

<p>We didn’t get to go on the brewery tour although there was 2 slots available for the 2pm tour because they don’t allow anyone under the age of 14. Gay offered to let me go and she’d take the kids to a park or for a walk but I opted out. After lunch, we went to the gift shop and I got a few beers that you can only get at the brewery: a 1999 Vintage Ale, a 2002 Vintage Ale, Fuller’s Old Winter Ale, Fuller’s Anniversary Ale (brewed in 2005 to commemorate 160 years of brewing) and two beers from Gale brewery (which is owned by Fuller’s): Prize Old Ale and Last Drop, the last beer ever to brewed at the Gale brewery before Fuller’s took over brewing.</p>

<p>I also got a couple tulip glasses with the Fuller’s logo on them, an ESB polo shirt and Havana picked out a little Fuller’s horse and buggy:</p>

<p>On the way back to the Tube station we stopped at a playground for Havana to get some of her energy out. It worked, she fell asleep in the stroller and slept through being lifted up the stairs to the train, through the train ride and the walk back home.</p>

<p>Gay, Havana and Hudson took a nap when we got home and I chilled the Chiswick Bitter I got at the brewery and tested out my new glass:</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We went to <a href="http://www.harrods.com/HarrodsStore/Default.aspx?CID=ppc">Harrod’s</a> so Gay could see it (I had been there years ago) and to get lunch stuff at their several rooms of gourmet delis. We walked to Hyde Park and ate lunch near the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Memorial">Albert Memorial</a> before hiking across the park into Kensington Gardens to the <a href="http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/kensington_gardens/diana_playground.cfm">Princess Diana Memorial Playground</a> (no, not Paris or Monte Carlo, ha ha ha).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3573524966/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2484/3573524966_0a0b84dd49.jpg" alt="Lunch in Hyde Park" /></a></p>

<p>The playground is a fancy playground complete with a big pirate ship as well as the usual swings, slides and various climbing area. It was built as a “tribute for a Princess who loved the innocence of childhood”. Unfortunately, it’s mobbed with screaming kids so you have to wait to even get into it. But Havana loved it and that’s worth a visit to me.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3572722545/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3235/3572722545_2bf93af5b2.jpg" alt="Princess Diana Memorial Playground" /></a></p>

<p>Both kids were tired as it took us a long time to get to the playground given Havana’s preference for walking most of the way. Rather than walk the 2.5 miles back home, we decided to grab a taxi and get back quickly. Both kids fell asleep in the taxi.</p>

<p>Eric stopped by to say goodbye as he’s leaving tomorrow morning for Prague. Later, Mark and Lee came by after work also to say goodbye since they’re leaving Saturday morning to go to Seattle for a couple weeks.</p>

            <p>After my run in the gym and the kids’ mid-day naps, I was assigned the job of babysitting so Gay and Eric could go to the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/">Tate Modern museum</a> for the afternoon. I spent the afternoon helping Hudson practice his crawling (he can go anywhere he wants to…. backwards) and entertaining Havana between shows on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/">CBeebies</a>. Before Gay and Eric got here, Havana and I watched <em>Kung Fu Panda</em>.</p>

<p>At 7, all five of us went down to a local pub, the <a href="http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/clubs_bars/venue-524.php">Rose &amp; Crown</a>, to watch the Championship League Final, kind of the Super Bowl of European soccer. It’s odd that they have such a big game on a Wednesday night. We had dinner and watched <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2009/may/27/manchester-united-barcelona-champions-league-final">Barcelona surprisingly defeat Manchester United</a>.</p>

<p>And yes, the correct term for the sport is “soccer”. Most people think that “football” is correct because you use your feet to control the ball, but football was a term used a long time ago to describe team games played on your feet as opposed to on a horse. There were many forms of football: rugby football (rugby), gridiron football (the game the Pittsburgh Steelers play) and association football (soccer). The term “soccer” was coined by the English in the late 1800s as a slang form of <em>association</em>. The term <em>football</em> is applied to the sport that is most popular in a given country. So in Europe, soccer is the most popular game so it’s called “football”, in Australia, “football” refers to rugby football and in America and Canada, “football” is the name given to gridiron football. So using the term soccer is less ambiguous than the term football.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Gay took the kids and went to Clerkenwell with Eric for the afternoon. I stayed at home and did some work for the first time on the trip, which is my form of relaxation. They walked around, took the kids to a playground and then went to dinner at another gastropub, <a href="http://www.thepeasant.co.uk/">The Peasant</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3569927942/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2440/3569927942_6ee61b9ae7.jpg" alt="IMG_0404" /></a></p>

<p>Incidentally, it’s pronounced “Clarkenwell” in the Queen’s English. Nobody knows what you’re talking about when you say it like it’s spelled. Speaking of pronunciations, “Grosvenor” is pronounced “Grove-ner”, “Leicester” is pronounced “Ly-ster”, “Gloucester” is similarly pronounced “Gly-ster” and “Hertford” is pronounced “Hartford” (they really hate Es, I guess) – even Mark, an American, didn’t understand us when we said “Hertford”. They must not tell UK kids to “sound it out” when learning to read.</p>
