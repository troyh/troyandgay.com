          <p>We’re not quite as adjusted to London time as we expected we’d be. Havana and Hudson both woke up at 1am and had trouble getting back to sleep. So we all ended up sleeping in too long.</p>

<p>After Havana’s nap we went for a walk to Belgravia. Once again, Havana insisted on walking on her own rather than ride in the stroller. We were heading to <a href="http://www.pubs.com/pub_details.cfm?ID=242">The Star Tavern</a>, a very old Fuller’s pub, where I could get Fuller’s ESB and we could get lunch. This place is famous because it is where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Train_Robbery_(1963)">The Great Train Robbery</a> was planned and where celebrities frequented in the 1960s.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.waitrose.com/branches/branchdetails.aspx?uid=665">Waitrose</a> grocery store was nearby so we stopped there to get some real coffee (instant coffee is provided in our apartment, expecting you to drink tea) and some wine and cheese to serve when Mark &amp; Lee visit this evening.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2009/05/17/3659.html">Dinner in Mayfair</a>
        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>I remembered that last time we landed in London July 7, 2005, we found ourselves in the middle of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_July_2005_London_bombings">a terrorist attack</a> just a couple hours after it happened. That was a surreal experience, but fortunately, nothing like that happened this time.</p>

<p>After checking into the hotel, we walked around the area a bit before going to a pub for dinner. The downstairs was full so we had to go upstairs for a table, which meant we had to take Havana out of the stroller even though she was fast asleep. I picked her up but she didn’t wake up. I heard a loud “pop” and realized she dropped her milk bottle and, this has never happened before, the top popped off and splattered milk all over.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>We eventually got the kids and the stroller upstairs and sat down at a table to feed Hudson. They were temporarily out of <a href="http://www.fullers-ales.com/london_pride.php">London Pride</a>, as close as London gets to Budweiser popularity-wise (not taste-wise), so we got a couple pints of cask-conditioned <a href="http://www.greenekingipa.co.uk/">Greene King IPA</a> and <a href="http://www.wellsandyoungs.co.uk/wellsandyoungs/beers/ales/courage-directors-bitter">Courage Directors Bitter</a>. I’m not sure what it is, but cask-conditioned beers taste better in London than they do in the US. This is good because cask-conditioned is very common here. Fuller’s London Pride is everywhere in London but <a href="http://www.fullers-ales.com/esb.php">Fuller’s ESB</a>, my favorite, isn’t. I asked the bar maid why this is and she said she had never heard of it! Hmmm. I need to get to a Fuller’s pub.</p>

<p>For dinner, I got the Fish &amp; Chips, something impossible to not get right in London. Gay took a gamble and got the Sunday roast special. I made the better choice. By this time, London Pride was back on tap so we each got a pint of it before finishing dinner and deciding to get two tired kids back home. Havana has an indepenent streak so she demanded to walk down the stairs by herself saying “I do it! I do it!”. We waited at the bottom of the stairs and with half the people in the bar watching her, Havana finally made it down. She walked about 10 blocks all the way home by herself.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>When we got to the airport we learned that the flight was delayed an hour because the plane was late due to weather leaving London. We checked-in, went to the British Airways lounge and waited with complimentary water, a beer and a glass of wine and really good mini sandwiches. During pre-boarding we went down to the gate to pack up the stroller, which will make you break a sweat. We thought we’d have to check the stroller into the cargo hold, but they let us take it on board and stash it in a closet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3539593580/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3651/3539593580_bafe4f8ac9.jpg" alt="British Airways Lounge @ SeaTac" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>We sat on the plane for another hour because some nitwit in SeaTac’s baggage department loaded baggage from a different flight on our plane, so they had to unload our plane to take the extra baggage off. The plane was ultimately 2.5 hours late.</p>

<p>This was the best flight I’ve ever been on! For starters, the question “Would you like some champagne, sir?” is the best thing I can hear when I’m about to take off on an airplane. We were in Club World, BA’s business class, so we had <a href="http://www.britishairways.com/travel/cwonboard/public/en_gb">lie-flat seats</a> and Gay, Havana and Hudson essentially had their own little room – I was on the other side of the wall. For the first time in my life, I slept on a plane. After dinner and a really stupid movie, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0901476/">Bride Wars</a>, I was tired so I made the bad flat and tried to go to sleep. I woke up and thought that I got an hour of sleep at the most, but the the pilot announced that we’d be landing in London in an hour. An hour?! I must’ve slept for 4 hours. On a plane. I never thought it’d happen.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3539594604/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2338/3539594604_5e32045041.jpg" alt="Salmon dinner" /></a></p>

<p>Hudson got a baby seat that mounted on a tray on the wall behind us and right after take-off, Gay put him in it and he immediately went to sleep. Havana was excited and tried really hard to stay awake, but eventually she fell asleep too and slept almost the entire flight.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3539593936/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3573/3539593936_707599edce.jpg" alt="Hudson's own bed" /></a></p>

<p>Before we landed, we had breakfast (cereal, fruit, yogurt and croissant) and coffee.</p>

<p>Thanks to BA letting us carry the stroller on board with us, it meant we’d have it as soon as we got off the plane and before going through customs and baggage claim allowing us to wheel the kids around the airport. Of course, Havana preferred to walk the entire way from the gate through customs, baggage claim and to the <a href="https://www.heathrowexpress.com/index.asp?SID={07F90EA1-ACF9-456B-BB15-97C30549C49A}">Heathrow Express</a> terminal. Why do we have a double-stroller?</p>

<p>We took the train to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddington_station">Paddington Station</a> and took a taxi from there to our hotel in Mayfair. I’ve always loved the <a href="http://www.lti.co.uk/home.php">taxis in London</a> but was amazed to find that we could fit the un-folded stroller, 3 suitcases, a backpack and 4 people in it comfortably inside (no trunk space).</p>

<p>Statistics: This was Hudson’s first airplane ride and Havana’s 11th (!). Both Havana and Hudson had their first rides on a train and in a taxi. This is Hudson’s first trip outside the USA and Havana’s third. This is my 4th visit to London and Gay’s 3rd.</p>

          <p>Seeing women use usernames of “so-and-so’s_mommy” online has always driven me crazy.  Didn’t those women have a name and their own identities before kids?  Why do they need to advertise that their ovaries work?  Of course, I also don’t see a reason to adopt your husband’s name just because you got married either, but just taking a last name seems more feminist than losing your identity completely to your kid.  BTW, what do these women do when the second kid is born? Katie Rophe skewers these same women, <a href="http://www.doublex.com/section/life/get-your-kid-your-facebook-page">who put pictures of their kids instead of their own in their facebook profile</a>.</p>

<blockquote>"Facebook, of course, traffics in exhibitionism: it is a way of presenting your life, at least those sides of it you cherry pick for the outside world, for show. One's children are of course an important achievement, and arguably one's most important achievement, but that doesn't mean that they are who you are. "</blockquote>

<p>By the way, I believe that when you send the Christmas photo card, you should be in it too.  I am/was friends with <em>you</em>, not your kids.</p>

          <p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3335/3531238317_5eaf659279_m.jpg" alt="Gay on bridge" />I’m training to run the <a href="http://www.rnrseattle.com/">Seattle RocknRoll Marathon</a> June 27th with my friends Laura &amp; Megan.  It has been <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2006/04/17/recent-history-inn-at-langley-whidbey-marathon/">years since I ran</a> a <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2005/06/08/3091/">marathon</a>, so it is like starting over.  My first long run over 10 miles actually happened on our San Fransisco trip, when I ran along the waterfront and across the Golden Gate bridge and back.  I was surprised to learn the bridge is two miles long.  I love the bridge.  It is gorgeous architecturally, and the orange color makes it stand out against the city on the south side and the green rolling hills on the north. It is dorky to say, but crossing the bridge on foot was exhilarating.  One of the best running experiences of my life.  Tomorrow I am aiming for 19 miles.</p>
