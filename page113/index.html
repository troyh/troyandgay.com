          </h3>
            <p>We took the car from Bovey Castle to the train station in Exeter, took the train to London’s Paddington Station then a taxi to St. Pancras station. We were at this station in 2005 to take the train to Paris but it’s been completely redone since then. An hour later, we boarded the Eurostar train to Brussels. This was a great ride. Our car was almost empty, there was just a group of 4 business people and a few other people in the car, so Hudson’s cries about his teeth didn’t bother anyone.</p>

<p>The food was pretty good too. I had the moussaka and Gay had the salmon. And wine, of course. Havana had a kid’s meal of chicken. I even found the latest Economist to read so I have one less issue to catch up on when I get home (why isn’t the Economist on the Kindle?!?).</p>

<p>We arrived in Brussels and took a taxi to the apartment we rented. Actually, we took it to the office to get the keys to the apartment, then to an ATM to get cash for the taxi and then to the apartment. We went out to get groceries for the kids, walked around the neighborhood and finally found <a href="http://www.lesbrassins.com/">Les Brassins</a>, which Gay had found online as a good place to go. The staff was very friendly, they gave us a table in the corner of the very crowded restaurant even though we didn’t have reservations. And the waitress was very polite with us on our first attempt in years to try to speak French.</p>

<p>The restaurant didn’t take credit cards (something surprisingly common in Brussels) so we were careful to stay within the limited cash we got from the cash machine. They have <a href="http://www.lesbrassins.com/en/bieres">lots of beers</a> but only two on tap, Taras Boulbas (?), and a wit beer. I got the first one and Gay got the other. Both were good and we were glad to be back in a land of carbonated beer. Gay got the spaghetti bollainaise, which everyone in the place seemed to have ordered so it was a safe bet that it was good. I thought I ordered the duck special but ended up with beef carpacchio, which we think was intended as an appetizer. Since we were limited on cash and because the kids were tired and Hudson was complaining about his teeth we figured we should eat and go as soon as we could. So I didn’t attempt a re-order of the duck. It was also very good and a big enough appetizer that I was content to order a second beer and enjoy that.</p>

<p>After dinner we returned to our apartment. We were disappointed in our apartment – Gay had found it online but the pictures didn’t match the reality. And although the neighborhood is billed as the hip place to be with great shopping, we didn’t find it that appealing (I never find shopping appealing) and it was 1.5 miles from the city center. After our experience walking in London, we realized that the kids can only take so much walking/strolling before getting very bored. So we decided we’d see if we could find a better hotel closer to the city center. After the kids went to bed, we got online and searched for a hotel.</p>

            <a class="post-link" href="/2009/06/02/british-royalty.html">British Royalty</a>
          </h3>
            <p>America was founded partly in revolt against the very notion of a King (of England) ruling the country and maybe that’s why I have such an aversion to the British love of their royal family. I’ve always thought it was strange when visiting, but I am more conscious of it on this trip. It’s bad enough in America when people fall in love with their politicians (let alone falling in love with movie and rock stars) but at least your favorite politician has actually <em>done something</em>, or is trying to do something, good for people. The biggest accomplishment anyone in the Royal Family has done is to be born, the second-biggest accomplishment is learning the proper time and method to drink tea in the afternoon.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>And they’re all born from only two families. You have to go back to the year 799 to count a total of five families in their family tree. In America we call that “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbreeding#Royalty_and_nobility">in-breeding</a>” and banish them to West Virginia. In the UK, they’re called “royalty” and get to live in palaces for free. Oh, and they all have no day jobs other than to not embarrass the family.</p>

<p>Ok, the US President gets to live in a nice house for free too. I accept, and even support, that because I think he (or she someday) needs to be freed of the burden of home ownership and maintenance <em>because they have a job</em>. An important job, even. But the White House is only 50,000 square feet. That’s a palace by American standards, but it’s a bathroom compared to Buckingham Palace’s <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_size_of_Buckingham_palace">828,000 square feet</a>! I guess 1,000,000 square feet just felt <em>too</em> ostentatious! And that’s just <em>one</em> of their homes. To put it in perspective, Bill Gates’ house is a puny 60,000 square feet, and he’s the richest man in America. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Alsaud of Saudi Arabia, who is worth $23 billion and whom you could just guess has a crazy unnecessary house, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2005/03/10/cx_sc_bill05_0310home.html">has a soccer field in his house</a> but it’s only <em>half</em> the size of Buckingham Palace.</p>

<p>More importantly, the US President only gets to live in the house while doing their job, not their entire life. And they have to live in Washington, DC which I consider a punishment. The Founding Fathers of America did it right and it’s even more impressive that over 200 years later, we still treat our President like what they are: an employee.</p>

<p>While on the topic, there’s currently <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE5514BS20090602">a scandal in Britain about the Members of Parliament</a> (the equivalent of US Congressmen) who billed some mortgage payments and moat-maintenance (!) on their homes to the government and those people are losing their jobs. Meanwhile, just down the street a little old lady sits alone in an 828,000 square foot home and her family has been billing the taxpayers for that for centuries and no one in Britain cares.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>This morning we took the kids to the castle for a “Falconry” show. It turns out that there was only one falcon but there was also a hawk and an owl. And we got up close with them. I assumed we’d watch birds land on the guy’s arm over and over. The falcon is considered too dangerous to be close to people so for that bird, he went down below the castle and the bird did several dives near him and away from people. As he explained, the owl would also be dangerous to people if it wasn’t so dumb and you were dumb enough to not move while it finally figured out to attack you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3584710977/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3609/3584710977_2956582366.jpg" alt="IMG_4699" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Right after the show, we took a walk to North Bovey for lunch. The maps weren’t very clear on the route but after a few false starts and after asking a groundskeeper, we found the footpath off the castle grounds and through the woods along the Bovey River (really a stream) to North Bovey. It was a little muddy and difficult to maneuver the stroller along the path and we had to hop a couple fences, but eventually we made it to the town and to <a href="http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/45/4555/Ring_of_Bells_Inn/North_Bovey">The Ring of Bells Inn</a>, the only place for food in North Bovey, for lunch. Luckily, the food was pretty good.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3584775893/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3341/3584775893_d3307688f3.jpg" alt="IMG_0599" /></a></p>

<p>Not wanting to walk back along the trail, we arranged for the cars (Range Rovers, of course) from Bovey Castle to pick us up and take us back. Both kids fell asleep on the 10-minute drive back.</p>

<p>After afternoon naps, we drove the golf cart through the castle grounds to eat an early dinner at the castle’s casual restaurant. There’s another nice restaurant but it requires that men wear a jacket and probably not a great for a little girl who likes to run around and say hello to people. Incidentally, this place has London Pride on tap and keg (ahhh, CO2, how I love thee!) as opposed to a handpumped cask, so I had that for the first time.</p>

<p>Havana loves the golf cart, what she calls a “tractor”. On the way home, she sat on my lap and steered and was very proud of herself for driving. It brought back a memory of me as a kid sitting on my dad’s lap and steering our car (a Datsun hatchback, I think). Once we got back to our place, she didn’t want to get out of the cart so I sat with her and we pretended to drive around, including a stop at the library and at the grocery store, places I think she knows she rides to when at home.</p>

<p>I have a bunch of beers I bought when <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/05/29/fullers-brewery/">we visited the Fuller’s Brewery</a> that Gay has asked me to drink so we don’t have to pack them and carry them again. I always do as I’m told, as long as what I’m told to do is drink beer. So I tried the Gale Brewery’s Old Prize Ale, which is the most interesting beer I’ve had yet. It’s almost like a sweet barley wine. After that, I had the Fuller’s Old Winter Ale which is maltier than an ESB and less bitter, not my favorite way to go, but one of the better beers I’ve had here. I still have three 500ml beers and one 330ml beer to go, which will take some effort to drink in one day before we leave Wednesday morning.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Last night we ordered room service, got suckered into watching <em>Britain’s Got Talent</em> and saw Susan Boyle <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6400081.ece">come in 2nd</a> to the most ridiculous dance troupe I think I’ve ever seen (Britain has talent, they just don’t know they do, I guess), packed our suitcases and got the kids to bed at a reasonable time so we could be checked-out by 9am to catch the train at 10am. We were in the taxi and on our way a few minutes early so we made it to Paddington Station in plenty of time to wait for our train.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3581121553/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3355/3581121553_9193fa3453.jpg" alt="Leaving London" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->
<p>The train left right on time; it was scheduled to leave at 9:57am and at 9:57am we were leaving the station. In America, no one would have bet that train would have left before noon. We rode through the English countryside and by 12:30pm we were in Exeter and getting into a taxi to take us to Bovey Castle in Dartmoor National Park.</p>

<p>It’s a 45 minute drive to Bovey so we asked the taxi driver to stop on the way so we could get lunch. His recommendation was Pizza Hut. That’s an indication of how bad the food would be on the way. We didn’t take his recommendation and ended up at a little family pub in Moretonhampstead. The food was not very good, Gay’s grilled “stuffed chicken breast” (meaning it had stuffing on the side) was inedible but I could at least eat my minced beef with onion and gravy with a puff pastry, but not the potatoes. After lunch, we got back in the taxi and rode the windy road through the hills to <a href="http://www.boveycastle.com/">Bovey Castle</a>. Havana fell fast asleep in my arms, so she got a short afternoon nap.</p>

<p>After getting assistance from the staff to pay the taxi driver since we didn’t  have enough cash, we checked-in and were given a tour of the place by the friendly staff. We relaxed in our room and then went to dinner at the casual restaurant in the castle. We had a much better dinner than we did lunch and ate on the balcony of the castle overlooking the grounds and the hills.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>After 4 years, we finally visited the Fuller’s Brewery. When we visited London in 2005 our taxi from Heathrow went right by it but because of the terrorist bombings that day, the brewery was closed to the public all week. So we left London without visiting. But today we finally made the trek out to Chiswick. I’ve been to a lot of breweries in the US, but the oldest, I think, dates back to the early 1980s. This brewery has been here for <a href="http://www.fullers.co.uk/rte.asp?id=34">over 350 years</a> (it became Fuller’s in 1845).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3575525603/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3598/3575525603_b76dce7d53.jpg" alt="Fuller's Brewery" /></a></p>

<p>It’s not that far, just a half-dozen stops and one transfer on the Tube, a 15-minute walk through Turnham Green to Chiswick and there it is. We had lunch at the Mawson Arms, the pub at the brewery. The food was nothing special, although Havana really liked her egg salad sandwich (she <em>loves</em> eggs!). But the ESBs we had were the freshest we’ve had yet and you could tell they were fresh because even on a handpump they had some carbonation.</p>

<p>We didn’t get to go on the brewery tour although there was 2 slots available for the 2pm tour because they don’t allow anyone under the age of 14. Gay offered to let me go and she’d take the kids to a park or for a walk but I opted out. After lunch, we went to the gift shop and I got a few beers that you can only get at the brewery: a 1999 Vintage Ale, a 2002 Vintage Ale, Fuller’s Old Winter Ale, Fuller’s Anniversary Ale (brewed in 2005 to commemorate 160 years of brewing) and two beers from Gale brewery (which is owned by Fuller’s): Prize Old Ale and Last Drop, the last beer ever to brewed at the Gale brewery before Fuller’s took over brewing.</p>

<p>I also got a couple tulip glasses with the Fuller’s logo on them, an ESB polo shirt and Havana picked out a little Fuller’s horse and buggy:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3575575307/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3369/3575575307_ae146c724e.jpg" alt="IMG_0514" /></a></p>

<p>On the way back to the Tube station we stopped at a playground for Havana to get some of her energy out. It worked, she fell asleep in the stroller and slept through being lifted up the stairs to the train, through the train ride and the walk back home.</p>

<p>Gay, Havana and Hudson took a nap when we got home and I chilled the Chiswick Bitter I got at the brewery and tested out my new glass:</p>
