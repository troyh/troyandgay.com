              <p>After a surprisingly exciting first week, the second week has been uneventful. Today Levi Leipheimer abandoned due to a broken wrist in what seemed like a minor crash and “two riders were shot with pellet guns”:http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/tdf2009/news/story?id=4337158.  In a week, there have been no changes in the GC and nothing interesting happening. They’re heading into the Alps this weekend so it should be a good final week.</p>

              <p>Steve and Renuka and their kids, Owen (5) and Claire (3), came over for dinner tonight. We grilled beef satays and a salmon on the bbq, Gay made an orzo and cucumber salad and homemade ice cream for dessert.</p>

<p>It’s cute to see Havana playing with other kids, she starts off shy but has so much fun and has a smile on her face the entire time. Hudson had fallen off the chair in the kitchen minutes before they arrived and cut his lip, scuffed his nose pretty badly and there was lots of blood – the worst injury he’s had yet. He was fine and not crying 30 minutes later, but his fat lip sure stuck out and his nose still looks bad.</p>

              <p>Cancellara cracked on the first mountain climb of the tour, not able to keep up with Astana driving the peloton. Contador attacked his own team, supposedly against the team’s plan, and leapt ahead of Lance by 2 seconds.</p>

              <p>Back from her vacation, <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/06/29/our-architect/">our architect</a> came over today to look at the property and talk about our options for locating the house. It doesn’t seem practical to move the house very far north and retain the view due to the slope of the property. But we still may be able to situate it so that we have one yard instead of a front and a back yard. Gay and I don’t quite agree on the importance of this, though. The architect will have to be creative to mediate between us on this and still give us south-facing windows for good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_solar_building_design">solar glazing</a>.</p>

              <p>The Roku (pronounced “Row-koo”, not “Rock You”, I’ve discovered) player <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/06/03/roku-netflix-player/">we got 13 months ago</a>, one month past the 1-year warranty, died last Friday. They wouldn’t replace it so I ordered a replacement. Good thing they’re only $100. I tested the power supply and it was delivering the correct voltage so I assumed it was the box itself. I was wrong.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.roku.com/Images/netflixplayer/home_content_box.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I got the new one today and tried the new power supply and it does work. Hmmm. Maybe the amperage is wrong? I can’t test that. Well, with a replacement power supply, we will have two and can use the old one elsewhere. It’s a great device, otherwise.</p>
