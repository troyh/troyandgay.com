              <p>Yesterday at 5:20pm, the same server the died <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/10/001770.php">a few weeks ago</a> died again. We went to investigate this morning and it had the same exact problem: the CPU fan quit causing the CPU to overheat and the machine to shut down.</p>

<p>So we just sat there on the floor of our co-location center and thought about our options. Thanksgiving is coming next week which is the 2nd most-trafficked (Christmas is #1) on the site so we wanted to have all servers running just in case something bad happens to one of them. That means it’s not enough time to just order a replacement part and wait for it to arrive. We thought to call our friends at <a href="http://www.siliconmechanics.com">Silicon Mechanics</a>, who helped us out in a pinch <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/10/001770.php">before</a>. Given that this wasn’t one of their machines, they had every right to refuse to help (after all, from personal experience, Dell doesn’t help  you when you have a problem with one of their machines!). But when we called them, they were more than happy to help and said to bring it over.</p>

<p>We arrived, interrupting their lunch time, they opened it up, I explained the problem and they gave it a once-over. This is a machine I built myself, and they knew it, but politely pointed out my errors. They cleaned off the gallon too much of thermal paste that I put on it and put in a new (hopefully better) CPU fan. But they didn’t stop there. They noticed that the CDROM and floppy drives were not hooked up (cuz I didn’t have a cable long enough to reach across the case) so they made a custom cable and installed it so they worked again. Then they sliced the flat ribbon cables and wrapped them up to improve airflow through the case. And they tied up all the loose cables that I left in there. Just amazing service!</p>

<p>We took the machine back, popped it back in the rack and powered it up. A repaired server in under 3 hours!</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/">74,000 recipes!</a>. Funny…. AllRecipes <em>finally</em> announced how many recipes they have. For over 4 years they said “Over 20,000 recipes” and I always thought at any time they’d say “Over 30,000 recipes”. But time came and went. Today, they finally announced a whopping 22,000 recipes. In the last year, we added 40,000 recipes. It took them 4 years to add 2,000. Sure, they’d probably argue quality over quantity (as if they’re the arbiters of quality)… yeah… and the internet would be better if there were a small number of “quality” web sites as opposed to the diverse huge set of web sites.</p>

<p>And I’ll refrain from talking about their confusing redesign and just note that there are fewer molecules in the universe than there are words on their home page (although the print is about as tiny as a molecule). And I think they could have probably squeezed one more ad in there somewhere. ;-)</p>

<p>But at least their employees have stopped calling us looking for a job. So they must be doing something right these days.</p>

              <p>I suppose I shouldn’t have been, but I was astounded at the Congressional reaction to the Massachusetts Supreme Court decision on the legality of gay marriage.  I do believe it will be impossible to get a Constitutional amendment to support the idea that marriage must be between a man and a woman, but I can’t believe they are even suggesting it.  I can’t stand the way they way the conservatives keep saying we need to “do this for the children” when I don’t know a single gay divorced family…  I especially like the way Hit &amp; Run, the Reason magazine weblog, describes it as causing “<a href="http://www.reason.com/hitandrun/003485.shtml">the equivalent of a divide-by-zero error in the circuitry of conservative brains, which are short circuiting en masse</a>.”</p>

<p>I really just don’t get what the problem is…marriage is sacrosanct to everyone that does it right?  Shouldn’t they be glad that the “prurient” gay heathens will now be monogamous?</p>
