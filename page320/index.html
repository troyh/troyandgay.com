              <p>As you can imagine, Thanksgiving is one of the busiest times for <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a>.  We had double our normal traffic and record days and the hardware and software all performed very well.  We even kept our chat room open with volunteers to help with last minute cooking questions.  Other missed events:</p>

<p>Our own Thanksgiving celebration was fun with Troy’s mom &amp; dad, his brother, Todd &amp; sister-in-law Rozanne, and niece Kristin, and nephew, Alex.  We served</p>

<a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/74273">Turkey Gravy</a>
Mashed Potatoes
Green Beans (I need to post my recipe…)
and Troy’s mom’s Leftse</p>

<p>Troy made 4 pies!

<a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/26205">Classic Pie Crust</a>
<a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/27855">Bourbon Pumpkin Pie</a>
<a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/53704">Buttermilk Pecan Pie</a></p>

<p>When we weren’t working, we had a great time playing board games, watching football and movies and generally hanging out.  Thanksgiving remains my favorite holiday and I was pleased the main event turned out (even though we were down to 1 working oven).</p>

<p>Sunday I ran the Seattle Half Marathon with my friends Megan &amp; Tiffany.  Megan and I ran slower than normal but we finished feeling great!  Hoping to do a full next year….</p>

<p>That afternoon, we cut our Christmas tree at <a href="http://www.bettymacdonaldfarm.com/">our neighbor’s</a> and carried it home.  Eighteen feet of pine and 1,200 lights have now taken over our living room, leaving pity little room for people, and a small structural danger – please no earthquakes til after New Years.</p>

<p>My mom came for a visit on Tuesday and I did my first official wedding planning:  the moms and I went wedding dress shopping.  It turned out to not be nearly as horrible as I expected.</p>

<p>Love family, but also love to have our inhabitant count back down to 2 people and 2 dogs.</p>

<p>Almost forgot to mention, the week before Thanksgiving we had <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/getchef.zsp?id=32724">Mr. &amp; Mrs. Mean Chef</a> over for dinner.  We had a really fun time, Leg of Lamb, Traditional <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/17544">Mint Sauce</a>, Mashed Potatoes, those same Thanksgiving Green Beans, an appetizer of goat cheese spread on crackers topped with 3 small slices of dates, which I invented myself in a quick after realizing I was out of eggs and couldn’t make Gourgere, and Mean brought <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/recipe/getrecipe.zsp?id=37527">dessert</a>!</p>

              <p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/ap/gay_marriage_bush">Bush will work to preserve the “sanctity of marriage”</a>. I wonder if he’s also considering going to war with people who get married and divorced over the course of a weekend for fun. Or the people who marry for ulterior motives (money, fame, immigration, etc). Or the people who serially cheat on their spouse. Aren’t these things destroying the “sanctity” of marriage far more than two people who are in love and are monogamous who just happen to be born with the same chromosome pairings?</p>

<p>I think the fundamental fallacy that people like Bush have is that being attracted to the same sex is a choice. My love for beer, bicycling, computers and the female form are built-in, they weren’t decisions I made – the only decision I made was that I’m public about these likes. I’m fortunate that society doesn’t have hatred for me because I naturally like these things (well, society used to label me a “nerd” for liking computers, but that day is long gone). And I choose to accept, even though I disagree with, people who don’t like beer, bicycling, computers or the female form. And I’ll never be President.</p>

              <p>Seems like the blog space here has been tied up mostly in outside or business news.  Hasn’t had a lot of personal flavor so I thought I’d share.</p>

<p>We are getting ready for a big family get together for Thanksgiving.  Troy’s parents, brother, his wife and 2 children will be here for the holiday.  It will be really nice to have a full house for Thanksgiving.  We spent last Thankgiving (well a day-delayed Thanksgiving, because one hazard of running a recipe site you don’t leave work before the biggest cooking holidays) with Troy’s parents, Todd &amp; Rozanne, and had a terrific time in Florida.  It will be fun to get together again.  Troy keeps waiting for me to get stressed about it, but frankly having two more cooks here takes the load off me.  I just hope I don’t act too dorky around the teenagers. ;-)</p>

<p>Troy’s parents are staying a few extra days and my mom is coming over for another visit.  They’ve all met before and enjoy each other.  I think it will be a little wedding planning summit for the mothers-in-law as well.</p>

<p>We had a VERY NICE dinner last weekend with our friends <a href="http://www.markweeksphotography.com">Mark</a> and Lee.  Lee fixed a lovely meal and I have to say the 2 couple dinner party is my new favorite social event.  Catching up is so much easier!  Mark and Lee live just one block away from Troy’s last bachelor apartment on Capitol Hill.  Driving around looking for parking for hours reminded us of how much we missed the place, the crack houses and especially the proximity of many cheap restaurants.</p>

<p>Today was an unplanned all day trip into the city.  One of the web servers died last night (thank god for redundancy – normally that would mean a late night ferry ride into Seattle), so we spent all day diagnosing the problem, getting parts from our very helpful and very knowledgeable friends at <a href="http://www.siliconmechanics.com">Silicon Mechanics</a>, and then reinstalling the machine.  First food: 3p Thai West Seattle.</p>
