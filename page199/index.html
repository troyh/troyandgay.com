        <article>
          <p><img src="/pix/Picture9_01.png" alt="" />How many people do you know that have been interviewed on Voice of America? Well, you know at least one now. Gay was interviewed this week for VOA’s <a href="http://voanews.gov/ourworld">Our World</a> show which features a web site every week. You can listen to Gay’s pretty voice by <a href="ftp://8475.ftp.storage.akadns.net/mp3/voa/english/nnow/nnow0133a1022.mp3">downloading the MP3</a>; the segment starts 18 minutes 21 seconds from the beginning. It’s a good concise piece and the show host clearly understands the concept of Recipezaar. If you have Quicktime, you can stream <a href="/public/gayvoa.mov">just the segment</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, I keep forgetting about this, but the “other free weekly” in Seattle did <a href="http://www.seattleweekly.com/features/0541/051012_food_online.php">an article</a> last week on Recipezaar. What was supposed to be an article on food web sites in Seattle turned into an incoherent article comparing Recipezaar and AllRecipes and something to do with Generation Y. You can pick up a copy of the <em>Seattle Weekly</em> next to the stands for <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Home">The Stranger</a>.</p>

<p>It’s amazing how many phone calls we get from the media given that we’ve never spent even 1¢ on PR or marketing. Free advertising is always good. :)</p>

          <p>Amid <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1304">speculation of the video iPod</a>, which <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0510oct12.html">has been refuted</a>, I just sync’d my iPod and got the following error message:</p>

<p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/Picture9.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It’s referring to an album that I bought that includes a video of one of the songs. “…cannot be played on this iPod” seems to imply that there may be another iPod that can play the video. Interesting.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/48874526/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/24/48874526_53f5b0e91b_m.jpg" alt="IMG_1613" /></a>This photo from our honeymoon last year was taken in Jimbaran Bay, where <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/01/AR2005100100624.html?nav=rss_print/asection">today’s Bali bombings</a> took place. Two of the bombs went off down the beach from where we were sitting; if you could see behind Gay, you’d see the line of beach restaurants where the bombs exploded.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this photo was taken Sept 30, 2004, almost the day of the bombings to the day. Scary. Before the honeymoon, I was seriously concerned about terrorism after learning about the nutjob terrorists in Bali. I drove Gay nuts with it, but now she knows I was right. :)  But this incident proves what I learned about the Bali Al-Qaeda group: they’re morons. They bomb things just to do it, with no regard to the political ramifications and without an apparent purpose. They’re the group of Al-Qaeda that wants so hard to belong and get attention, but can’t figure out how to do anything but kill other Muslims. And in the end, they only hurt their own country and their own people, but have absolutely no political gain.</p>

<p>It’s weird, we were here at the place of these Bali bombings and we landed in London the day of the London bombings this year. We need to figure out where to go on vacation that aren’t bombing targets. ;)</p>
