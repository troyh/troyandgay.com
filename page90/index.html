          <p>I’m documenting this here so I can diagnose myself the next time this happens…</p>

<p>On the flight back from San Francisco I put my in-ear headphones in and a few minutes later Gay said something to me so I took the right one out to hear her. The ear bud came off and was stuck in my ear and I couldn’t get it out. I had to wait until I got home 3 hours later to remove it. After removing it, I still felt like my ear was plugged. It started to hurt more and more over the next day.</p>

<p>Gay had a similar problem a couple years ago and was prescribed <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?id=8978"><strong>Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates and Hydrocortisone OTIC Suspension, USP</strong></a>. She didn’t use it all and kept it in her drawer. So I tried it. The next day the pain was gone and the day after that my ear was  fine again.</p>

<p>Before my next flight, I’m going to get noise-canceling headphones that don’t go in my ear.</p>

<blockquote>

Large financial institutions that engage in speculative activities for profit should be allowed to fail if they get in trouble, White House advisor Paul Volcker said on Sunday.

As Congress debates financial reform in the wake of the worst financial crisis since the 1930s, Volcker has argued for fencing off investment firms primarily engaged in market speculation from commercial, deposit-taking banks.

"If a big non-bank institution gets in trouble and threatens the whole system, there ought to be some authority that can step in, take over that organization and liquidate it or merge it -- not save it," Volcker said on CNN.

"It's called euthanasia, not a rescue."</blockquote>

<p>It’s about time we have an administration in the White House that doesn’t think it’s okay to let the free market run amok. He also favors putting the Glass-Steagall Act back in place, whose removal allowed banks to mix risky investing with traditional banking, bringing risk to the entire economic system, requiring the Federal Govt to prop them up or allow our economy too crumble. Unfortunately, the Republicans in Congress are sure to prevent that from happening.</p>

          <p>I was listening to my music library randomly today and heard a song from a band called “The Amps” that I’ve never listened to and it sounded so familiar I thought it was a cover version.</p>

<p>In 1989, <a href="http://www.newmodelarmy.org/">New Model Army</a> released “Inheritance” and it starts like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.com/uploads/2010/01/Inheritance.mov">http://troyandgay.com/uploads/2010/01/Inheritance.mov</a></p>

<p>10 years later, in 1999, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amps">The Amps</a> (formed by Kim Deal of the Pixies and The Breeders) released “<a href="http://new.music.yahoo.com/amps/tracks/hoverin--1081914">Hoverin</a>” and it starts like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.com/uploads/2010/01/Hoverin.mov">http://troyandgay.com/uploads/2010/01/Hoverin.mov</a></p>

<p>That’s a blatant rip-off, in my opinion.</p>
