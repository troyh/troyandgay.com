        <article>
          <p>We packed up and left our place around 11am and drove to San Jose del Cabo, the opposite direction from Cabo San Lucas and the town near the airport. San Jose is much less touristy than Cabo – far fewer places for gringos to drink all day and night. We walked around the town a little and then went for lunch. We ordered the kids quesadillas which were the best quesadillas I’ve ever had; the chicken was shredded and the tortillas were fresh. I got chicken fajitas and Gay got a chicken dish served in a hot clay pot. This was one of the best meals we had. After lunch, we walked around town some more before heading to the airport.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>Our flight was at 4:30pm. We were at the gate by 3:30 so I watched the San Diego vs. Dallas game in the terminal. We got on the plane by 4pm and we were taxiing down the runway by 4:20pm. The kids were good on the flight, Hudson took an hour nap and Havana watched her shows on the iPhone. There was a couple kids behind us that did not have a good flight and I felt for their parents.</p>

<p>We landed at 7:30pm Seattle time and were off the plane and through customs by 8:30. Havana was full of energy in the airport but was fast asleep by the time we pulled out of the parking garage. We caught the 9:20 ferry to Vashon and the kids were in their beds before 10pm.</p>

<p>It’s in the 30°s in Seattle, much colder than the 70°s in Cabo, but I am glad to be home. 70° weather in December is wrong. I’m also glad to be away from that big fireball in the sky that makes it impossible to leave the shade and live without sticky smelly sunscreen all over you.</p>

<p><strong>Travel statistics:</strong></p>

<p>Troy and Gay: 5th time in Mexico. I can’t believe we’ve been there 5 times; I need to visit several other countries (Spain, Italy, China, etc.) before going to Mexico again.
Havana: 4th trip outside the US, 4th country, 2nd time to Mexico, 14th airplane ride.
Hudson: 2nd trip outside the US, 3rd country, 1st time to Mexico, 4th airplane ride.</p>

          <p>We got a baby-sitter in the morning to entertain the kids so we could relax by the pool on our last day. After their afternoon naps, we took the golf cart over to the resort to go to the beach and walk around.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4181730014/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4005/4181730014_68744bb04e.jpg" alt="IMG_1427" /></a></p>

<p>Our place was next to the resort but we’re not supposed to be in the resort and we eventually were chased out by the security guard. I don’t know why, nobody was there so we weren’t bothering anyone. Security guards tend to take their jobs too seriously. After the kids went to bed, we had a dinner by ourselves for a change.</p>

<p>I’ve had enough of the heat and sun. I’m ready to get back to Seattle, which has been in the 30s all week and to get ready for Christmas.</p>

          <p>Eric and Valerie, on their sailing trip from Seattle to France, are docked in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Paz,_Baja_California_Sur">La Paz</a>, relaxing for a month after <a href="http://blog.mailasail.com/pacificmystic/30">a stressful trip</a> from San Diego.  They took the bus down to Cabo today to meet us. We met at the marina and had dinner.</p>

<p>They stayed at our place Wednesday night. Eric had to fly back to Seattle for a week on Thursday afternoon, so Gay and Valerie drove him to the airport and went shopping while I watched the kids back at the house.</p>

          <p>It’s hot in the morning in Cabo.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4165791067/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2620/4165791067_6115940f25.jpg" alt="Morning in Cabo San Lucas" /></a></p>

<p>I discovered that I forgot to pack shorts so we went to a shopping mall in the town of Cabo to see if I could find some. The mall was big but very empty of both people and stores. We did find a Nautica store and got a couple shorts. I’m glad we found them because my other option was to get shorts at Costco or Wal-Mart.</p>
