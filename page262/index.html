First of all, I’m mortified.</p>

<p>When the reporter called for the interview, I didn’t know it was going to be for their “Better Than You” column (how snotty is that) and I didn’t know what the column was like.  I consented, mostly because she said her editor <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=alex+gronke&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Alex Gronke</a> an old, old friend of mine from college, suggested it.  I’d much rather talk about our business than what song I’d sing at karaoke (the answer I cribbed from my friend Megan, btw), but any press for Recipezaar is a good thing – largely because Google dominates search and they rank results based on whether quality sites link to you.  Little did I know dumb RedHerring has an “editorial policy against linking to people’s sites”.  Yup, even the sites that they are profiling!  So not only do I feel like a bit of an ass, turns out I didn’t even sell out for anything.</p>

<p>You know I’d understand if this policy was to prevent people from making disingenuous plugs” in comments posted to their site or something, but it is just paranoid not to link to a site you profile ostensibly because you think what we do is somewhat cool.  RedHerring, you’re a tech/business mag, we’re a recipe site, you have nothing to fear from us….</p>

<p>Stupid non-web web companies and my own humiliation aside, I don’t fault my pal.  Alex and I were friends for the semester I spent at college at the <a href="http://www.ies.ac.at/">Institute for European Studies in Vienna</a>, ignominiously the only foreign studies program at Whitman taught entirely in English, so I could attend.  Alex is one of the best writers and raconteurs I’ve even known.  Someday he will write the Great American Novel – er, make that Eastern European Novel.  I’m glad he even remembers me.</p>

          <p><img src="http://www.americanrecordings.com/slayer/disco_reign.gif" alt="" />We’ve been watching lots of movies again recently. Nothing worth mentioning, but we saw “River’s Edge”:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091860/ last night. I hadn’t seen that movie since I was a teenager (feels like yesterday), but that movie is even better than I remembered. It must be the movie before Keanu Reeves got a lobotomy to remove all emotion. The reason I watched when I was a teenager is because it featured music by “Slayer”:http://www.americanrecordings.com/slayer/, and heavily, this was when Slayer was a nobody band, but one of my favorites (yes, I was a teenage boy once). And it was a lot of fun hearing those songs I hadn’t listened to in a lonnnng time. Anyhooo…. Crispin Glover was really good and Dennis Hopper was great, makes me wanna see “Easy Rider”:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064276/, but the uncaring of the characters to their friend’s murder and the way they all react was done better than any movie since. “The <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em> of the 80s”, the trailer said.</p>

<p>Watching “Godfather III”:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099674/ now…..</p>

          <p>Powell said the huge explosion in North Korea is “not a nuclear test”:http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;e=2&amp;u=/ap/20040912/ap_on_re_as/nkorea_explosion. That confused me, I thought for sure they’d use this to prove that North Korea is a threat. Why would they quickly work to diminish fears that would certainly help Bush’s re-election?</p>

<p>Maybe “Richard Reeves”:http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/ucrr/20040912/cm_ucrr/whatifwehadnotgoneintoiraq has the answer: <em>Among the many people quoted in the Atlantic is Jeffrey Record, a professor of strategy at the Army War College, who summed up a good deal of the thinking in Washington now: “Are we better off in basic security than before we invaded Iraq? The answer is no. An unnecessary war has consumed American Army and other ground resources, to the point where we have nothing left in the cupboard for another contingency – for instance, should the North Koreans decide that with the Americans completely absorbed in Iraq, now is the time to do something.”</em></p>

          <p>“The Guardian”:http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1302834,00.html: <em>US Secretary of State Colin Powell described neo-conservatives in the Bush administration as ‘fucking crazies’ during the build-up to war in Iraq. … The ‘crazies’ are said to be Vice-President Dick Cheney, Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his deputy, Paul Wolfowitz.</em></p>
