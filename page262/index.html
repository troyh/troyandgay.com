          <p>Last night, we went to the “charity auction”:http://www.vashonisland.net/rotary/ that we “helped out initially”:http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2625 on. It was held at “Misty Isle Farms”:http://www.mistyislefarms.com/, the home of Tom Stewart, a local Vashon celebrity. That alone was a treat for us, never having been there. He lives on beautiful grounds, immaculately landscaped complete with a waterfall and a rose garden.</p>

<p>It was raining like crazy (Seattle has had an unusually wet summer) and it was outside, but it was covered by a huge tent. The food was prepared by the same people who did our wedding Rehearsal Dinner a few weeks ago, so that was good. The event was a wine festival so there was plenty of wine and cheese to taste, and that we did.</p>

<p>Most of the auction items were expensive bottles of wine and we were outbid on a few bottles of wine by people at our own table, apparently wine connoisseurs. But we did end up with a bottle of 1984 “Stags Leap”:http://www.stagsleapwinery.com/ Cabernet Sauvignon. I think we overpaid, but hey, it’s for charity. :)  Gay also bought three of the table centerpieces, large glass vases.</p>

<p>After the auction, we went to our friends’ house for some (more) wine, to play with their new puppy and we watched “Fargo”:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116282/. Great movie.</p>

          <p>Check out the “survival time graph”:http://isc.sans.org/survivalhistory.php for Windows XP. It’s getting shorer. In other words, if you install Windows XP, connect to the internet with its default setup, your computer will be infected in 20 minutes. Don’t run Windows with Administrator privileges on your Windows account!</p>

          <p>The painting, known more for its kitchy greeting card and blow-up doll representations in the US, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/international/AP-Norway-Museum-Theft.html?hp">“The Scream” is simply taken off the wall of the museum midday in Norway.</a>  I can’t believe Norway would have such horrible security after this painting has already been stolen once.</p>

Normally I’d call that a film
But it moved me
And that didn’t rhyme with film.</em></p>
