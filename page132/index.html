              <p>For anyone Googling for a similar problem they’re having with DirecTV…</p>

<p>We have two DirecTV receivers and on one of them we were having a lot of pixelation, i.e., digital artifacts, on HD channels. It would get so bad it was unwatchable. This happened for months. I called DirecTV and they always shipped me a new receiver and it always solved the problem for a while. But the problem always returned eventually.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>It’s relatively easy to get a new receiver, DirecTV ships you a new one,  you replace your old with the new and put the old one in the same box and slap the FedEx sticker they provide on it and back it goes. But, to their credit, DirecTV wanted to get to the bottom of the problem so I was elevated to “Home Response Service” or somesuch name. This means I get better service, they come to your house quickly and the customer service repeatedly call you to make sure you’re happy.</p>

<p>Long story short, after an inability to solve the problem, the last DirecTV tech that came out decided to replace the “B-Band converters”:http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/global/contentPageNR.jsp?assetId=P4370042. Neither of us that it’d fix it but he had nothing else to try. It turns out that one of them rattled when you shook it, as if the electronics inside had become unglued. Since replacing them, the picture has been perfect!</p>

<p>The converters just hang off the back of the receiver in between it and the coax cable. My theory is that the electronics in the B-Band converter would sometimes sit right in the box and the picture would be okay, but if they were jiggled enough they’d get dislodged and the problem would come back. Usually when I replaced the receiver, the converter happened to sit right and eventually they’d get bumped and the problem would come back.</p>

<p>Fortunately, DirecTV’s newest HD DVR, the HR-23, has these converters built-in so this problem will disappear for DirecTV eventually. But those of us with the HR-22 or older receivers who have to use the extra converters will potentially have this problem.</p>

              <p>We ate well during the Super Bowl. Megan made 7-layer dip, a really good guacamole (nicely salty) and veggies and dip. Gay made “Primanti Bros”:http://www.primantibros.com/ sandwiches and cup cakes that we both decorated. Coincidentally, Megan had the same cupcake idea and she made similar cupcakes with the Steelers emblem on them.</p>

<p>The beers we had were “Full Sail Amber”:http://www.fullsailbrewing.com/amber.cfm that Jon &amp; Megan brought over and we had Sierra Nevadaa’s “Torpedo Extra IPA”:http://www.sierranevada.com/beers/torpedo.html (a double IPA which was new to me), Pike Pale (a low-alcohol beer well-suited for football games) and “Lagunitas IPA”:http://www.lagunitas.com/beers/ipa.html, but that was intended to be “Lagunitas Pils”:http://www.lagunitas.com/beers/pilsner.html. After the game we popped a bottle of “Schramsberg”:http://www.schramsberg.com/ champagne to toast the Steelers. Surprisingly, I was not hung-over in the morning. although that game was worth having a hang-over for.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>After playing the toughest schedule in the NFL and finishing 12-4 (the Cardinals had one of the easiest schedules and finished 9-7), the Steelers won Super Bowl XLIII, 27-23, and became the first team to win 6 Super Bowls (Note: they were also the first team to win 3 and 4 Super Bowls). I can’t believe it took 25 years to win their 5th and only 3 more years to win their 6th.</p>

<p>Going into the game, I didn’t think much of the Cardinals. In fact, I was rooting for them in the NFC Championship against Philadelphia because I thought they’d be easy to beat in the Super Bowl. I figured the Steelers #1 defense would easily crush the Cardinals 2-player offense. Pundits theorized that ex-Steelers Offensive coaches Whisenhunt and Russ Grimm, who now coach the Cardinals, were a threat to the Steelers. But I didn’t think so because neither were very good for the Steelers – their offensive game and their offensive line sucked. I often wished the Steelers would fire Whisenhunt. Besides, the future Hall-of-Famer defensive coach Dick LeBeau knows as much about Whisenhunt’s offense as Whisenhunt knows about LeBeau’s defense. I thought the Steelers had the advantage on both sides of the ball and Cardinals would score a max of 10 points while the Steelers ran away with it. I was less worried about this Super Bowl than I was in the 2005 Super Bowl against the hapless Seahawks. <em>That’s</em> how confident I was!</p>

<p>But the Cardinals played well. I don’t understand why Pittsburgh couldn’t stop the same two plays over and over. The Cardinals offense amounts to either a quick slant pass or screen pass to Fitzgerald or Boldin. But they could complete those plays almost every time, one ended up being a 64-yard TD to put the Cardinals ahead late in the game. And, as they did all year, the Steelers offense had a poor running game and Roethlisberger was under pressure on almost every play  (which tends to work out well for him, ironically).</p>

<p>While the Steelers won with a last-minute drive and a last-second TD pass, the Steelers proved that defenses win Championships. The goal-line interception and 100-yard run by James Harrison was the most important play in the game.</p>

<p>Congratulations to the Steelers, to Santonio Holmes for the MVP, to James Harrison for one of the most memorable plays in Super Bowl history and to Mike Tomlin for being the youngest coach, at 36, to win a Super Bowl and only the second to win a Super Bowl within their first two years as coach.</p>

              <p>Today Havana reached for my hand and said “Come”, which is a new thing she does when she wants you to go somewhere with her. She walked me into the downstairs bathroom and pointed to the toilet and said “Up”, which is what she does when she wants to be picked up. I asked her if she wants to sit on the toilet and she said “Okay”, what she says when she means “Yes”. I thought that was odd until she said “Potty” and it dawned on me that she wanted to use the toilet. I asked her if she had to go potty and she said “Okay”.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I didn’t know what to do at this point. We didn’t think she was close to going to the bathroom on her own and I figured that if she was going to, mommy was the best person to help her. But Gay was in the shower so it was me or nothing. I asked her again if she had to go potty hoping that she’d say “No” this time, but she said “Okay” again. Uh oh. I waited some more hoping I was misunderstanding her, but she was intent on sitting on the toilet.</p>

<p>So I told her that she needs to take off her pants, so she immediately sat down as she does when we tell her she needs to put her shoes on. She started to pull at her pants but I had to help her. She immediately stood up and went to the toilet again. I told her she had to take off her diaper first and then had to help her with that. We don’t yet have a potty-training seat to use, so I put her on the toilet and held her there so she wouldn’t fall in. She sat there for a while without doing anything and then tried to get off the seat. False alarm.</p>

<p>We’re still not sure that she was really trying to go the bathroom but she was definitely interested in the toilet.</p>
