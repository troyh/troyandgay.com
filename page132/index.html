          <p>“The Economist”:http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12599247&amp;CFID=31327400&amp;CFTOKEN=15534738 on why the Republican party lost. Their lack of ideas:</p>

<p>bq. The Republicans lost the battle of ideas even more comprehensively than they lost the battle for educated votes, marching into the election armed with nothing more than slogans. Energy? Just drill, baby, drill. Global warming? Crack a joke about Ozone Al. Immigration? Send the bums home. Torture and Guantanamo? Wear a T-shirt saying you would rather be water-boarding. Ha ha. During the primary debates, three out of ten Republican candidates admitted that they did not believe in evolution.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Their embracing of ignorance and incompetence:</p>

<p>bq. The Republican Party’s divorce from the intelligentsia has been a while in the making. The born-again Mr Bush preferred listening to his “heart” rather than his “head”. He also filled the government with incompetent toadies like Michael “heck-of-a-job” Brown, who bungled the response to Hurricane Katrina. Mr McCain, once the chattering classes’ favourite Republican, refused to grapple with the intricacies of the financial meltdown, preferring instead to look for cartoonish villains. And in a desperate attempt to serve boob bait to Bubba, he appointed Sarah Palin to his ticket, a woman who took five years to get a degree in journalism, and who was apparently unaware of some of the most rudimentary facts about international politics.</p>

<p>bq. Republicanism’s anti-intellectual turn is devastating for its future. The party’s electoral success from 1980 onwards was driven by its ability to link brains with brawn. The conservative intelligentsia not only helped to craft a message that resonated with working-class Democrats, a message that emphasised entrepreneurialism, law and order, and American pride. It also provided the party with a sweeping policy agenda. The party’s loss of brains leaves it rudderless, without a compelling agenda.</p>

<p>Their war on education and intelligence:</p>

<p>bq. This is happening at a time when the American population is becoming more educated. More than a quarter of Americans now have university degrees. Twenty per cent of households earn more than $100,000 a year, up from 16% in 1996. … McKinsey, a management consultancy, argues that the number of jobs requiring “tacit” intellectual skills has increased three times as fast as employment in general. The Republican Party’s current “redneck strategy” will leave it appealing to a shrinking and backward-looking portion of the electorate.</p>

<p>Their supporters are idiots like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity:</p>

<p>bq. Why is this happening? One reason is that conservative brawn has lost patience with brains of all kinds, conservative or liberal. Many conservatives–particularly lower-income ones–are consumed with elemental fury about everything from immigration to liberal do-gooders. They take their opinions from talk-radio hosts such as Rush Limbaugh and the deeply unsubtle Sean Hannity. And they regard Mrs Palin’s apparent ignorance not as a problem but as a badge of honour.</p>

<p>If the Republican Party is going to ever win another election, they’re going to have to bring in the Republicans that appreciate intelligence and education and ignore the right-wing lunatics and the ignorant who would have us living under a strict religious Taliban-like government rather than a progressive tolerant one. Will it happen?</p>

<p>bq. How likely is it that the Republican Party will come to its senses? There are glimmers of hope. Business conservatives worry that the party has lost the business vote. Moderates complain that the Republicans are becoming the party of “white-trash pride”. Anonymous McCain aides complain that Mrs Palin was a campaign-destroying “whack job”. One of the most encouraging signs is the support for giving the chairmanship of the Republican Party to John Sununu, a sensible and clever man who has the added advantage of coming from the north-east (he lost his New Hampshire Senate seat on November 4th).</p>

<p>But it’s not likely:</p>

<p>bq. But the odds in favour of an imminent renaissance look long. Many conservatives continue to think they lost because they were not conservative or populist enough–Mr McCain, after all, was an amnesty-loving green who refused to make an issue out of Mr Obama’s associations with Jeremiah Wright. Richard Weaver, one of the founders of modern conservatism, once wrote a book entitled “Ideas have Consequences”; unfortunately, too many Republicans are still refusing to acknowledge that idiocy has consequences, too.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Watch this compilation of financial shows with Peter Schiff starting more then two years ago predicting the housing crash, the credit crunch and a long recession while all the other “experts” literally laughed at him and called him “pessimistic”:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/2I0QN-FYkpw&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1">http://www.youtube.com/v/2I0QN-FYkpw&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1</a></p>

<p>Ben Stein, proving that bad actors should not go on TV pretending to be economists, even declared Merrill Lynch “an astonishingly well-run company” – less than a year later Merrill Lynch doesn’t exist anymore, they were so well-run.</p>

<p>And it’s all mostly Fox News, which again, proves that if you watch Fox News and believe what comes out of the speaker your brain is filled with falsehoods.</p>
