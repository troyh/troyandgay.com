          <p>Havana got into the preschool we wanted her to go to. We were on the waiting list, but everyone had already paid for next year so we weren’t hopeful that she’d get in. But we found out today that someone changed their mind so Havana is in!</p>

        <article>
          <p>We found out today that two big problems we’d been worrying about for weeks were solved.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5571725669/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5255/5571725669_0020b93ffa.jpg" alt="Master bath tile mock-up" /></a></p>

<p>The master bath tile looked like it would be difficult to set on corners of the bathroom because of its unusual surface – it has a bevel on the top and bottom and the face is convex. At the corners where the wall ends, some of the tiles would be cut and, because of the surface, it would be hard to make it look right, especially on outside corners. The tile guy was very worried about it and built a little wall to do a mock-up and it didn’t look good. So for weeks we’ve been going round and round about it with the tile guys, the designers and the manufacturer trying to figure out how to make it work. It seemed that it was meant to only be used on one wall but we wanted to use it on all walls of the bathroom, which requires going around corners. Everyone seemed convinced that it wouldn’t work and we had to pick another tile. I kept at it because I loved this tile the second I saw it but even I was considering giving up. With the master bath finally prepped for tile, they did a mock-up on the wall and, lo and behold, it looks good!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5572314850/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5224/5572314850_a8a96fab7c.jpg" alt="Kitchen tile cleaned" /></a></p>

<p>The other problem was the kitchen tile. When it arrived, they unpacked it from the crates, laid some down and they saw ugly stripes of burnishing in them. They were packed with two lengths of padding between each stone. As they traveled from China by boat, the vibration of the boat caused the padding to rub and wore stripes into them, as if they were sanded. It took 5 weeks to get the tile here, so we couldn’t just order more because that would delay a lot of work that was waiting for the kitchen floor to be done. While Mark worked with the US retailer in San Francisco to see if they would either replace the tiles or pay to have it repaired and we tried to figure out if we could arrange in the kitchen so that the worst of it was not visible – not likely, it turned out that 120 of the 130 tiles were damaged. Another shortened long story, Mark tried cleaning it with a mild cleaner and the burnishing came right out and they look great!</p>

          <p>We took Havana and Eva on the 9:40a ferry while Hudson was at school. We were taking Havana to a preschool we’re trying to get her into in the Fall. We stopped at the house to test some paint colors and wallpaper options we like. Then we went to U Village to look at a few pieces of furniture we liked. We had lunch at the Ram Brewery and then went to the preschool.</p>

<p>When we got there, it was after-school play time and she had fun playing with the other kids and she got to help paint a backdrop for their Spring play they were putting on this week. It’s doubtful she’ll be able to go there because they’re full, but we’re on the waiting list.</p>

<p>We went back to the house and talked with Mark about various things and got updates on work. We left the house at 4:30p, stopped at Talarico’s again for take-out, missed the 5:40p ferry and got on the 6p ferry  – 2 hours to get home, ugh!</p>

          <p>The New York Times’ <a href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2011/03/27/travel/27hours-seattle.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">36 Hours In Seattle</a> is centered mostly on Capitol Hill and the up and coming South Lake Union area, which is right next to Capitol Hill. It includes Volunteer Park Cafe, which is just a couple blocks from our house in “one of Seattle’s oldest and prettiest neighborhoods.”</p>

<p>This reminds me, we just found out from one of the children of the previous owner of our house that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Nickels">Greg Nickels</a>, the previous Mayor of Seattle, grew up right next door to our house.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Gay met with the interior designers for round 2 of their plans. After <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/03/03/furniture-fabrics/">the first round</a>, we felt we were pretty far away from something we liked. But this one is much closer. We still need to find out how much some of the things cost before committing to them and we need to convince ourselves that some of the furniture is worth the price, but for the most part, we like the paint colors, fabrics and most of the furniture.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5559138760/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5188/5559138760_678bc5f3a0.jpg" alt="Foyer" /></a></p>

<p>She also met with the landscape designer to see round 2 of that. Again, we’re very close to finishing that design. We need to get a better idea of the cost of things and make some minor adjustments.</p>

<p>She also saw the fireplace installed and talked to the tile guy about laying out the kitchen tile. No decision is simple; deciding where the full tiles should be and where the partial tiles should be in the room is always a trade-off and the tile guy doesn’t quite agree with the interior designers, so the decision ends up with us.</p>
