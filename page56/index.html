          </h3>
            <p>We went into Seattle to go to University Village. Hudson still prefers not to use the toilet unless it’s on the ferry, which he’s learned will allow him to go out on the deck of the ferry to see the water after he’s done going potty. Today was no exception. I took him and Havana up to the bathroom and, while Hudson was waiting for Havana to finish, he was holding onto the bathroom stall wall while I was helping Havana when an idiot walked into the nextdoor stall and closed the door and locked it, squishing Hudson’s finger in the door.</p>

<p>Hudson can scream like nobody’s business and this guy was oblivious to the screams echoing through the bathroom. I had to beat on the door and yell at him to get him to unlock the door. When he finally did, he had a dumb look on his face like he had no idea what was going on. Even after I told him that Hudson’s fingers were caught in the door, it took him several seconds to understand and even then had to ask “Oh, did I close the door on his fingers?”. <em>Yes, you did you moron!</em> He was probably drunk, stoned or both – he looked like a guy who had been sitting out in the sun all day. He apologized, but what a clueless clod. Hudson finally stopped crying when I got him back to the car with mommy, but his finger was clearly hurting all the way to University Village where we got him some ice cream.</p>

<p>Poor Hudson, he seems to get hurt a lot more often than Havana does. He has a short memory, though, because on the way home he asked again to go up to the bathroom. This time there was no injury and he had a blast running around on the windy deck.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>While Gay went to Costco to buy <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/05/26/hot-tub-and-house-update/">the hot tub</a>, I stayed at the house to start installing the ladder rack in the basement. Jon and Megan came over at 6 to see the house and Gay got back soon after. We gave them a tour of the house and then went to Volunteer Park Cafe for the <a href="http://www.stonebrew.com/">Stone Brewing Co.</a> beer dinner, an event I have been looking forward to since we had to cancel our reservation for last year’s event. Dinner was excellent but the beers were mostly standard Stone beers (Levitation Ale, Pale Ale, IPA) and the only Stone beer I hadn’t had before was their Highway 78 Scotch Ale, which unfortunately, is not available in Washington State – I really liked that . Their Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale was the stand-out for me, certainly the best Black IPA/Cascadian Dark Ale I’ve had since it’s a style I’m not fond of.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We’re working on the plans for the house’s backyard, so it’s time to order the hot tub. We went over to Bellevue to <a href="http://www.richshome.com/locations.asp?map=Bellevue">Rich’s</a> to see <a href="http://www.clearwaterspas.com/index.cfm">Clearwater Spas</a> and then to Aqua-Quip to see <a href="http://www.sundancespas.com/">Sundance Spas</a>. We were essentially decided on a Clearwater Spas hot tub but wanted to see them all in-person and select the exact model and check out the color options before committing. We didn’t like the Sundance Spas, so we stuck with Clearwater. They’ve all got Memorial Day sales (it’s not just for mattresses anymore, I guess) right now but it turns out that Clearwater Spas, a local company, is at Costco this week selling them directly. Rich’s would sell it for about $2,000 off their normal price, but we saved an additional $3000 off Rich’s price. $5,000 will buy lots of beer – I love you, Costco!</p>

<p>Hot tubs are a weird market. Not many people buy them, as opposed to something like TVs, and of the people that do buy them, they only buy one or two in their lifetime, so there’s not a lot of good information or reviews about hot tubs. This makes it hard to separate the good from the bad. This leads me to believe that they’re all not very good. They certainly still look ugly with their fake plastic wood sides (note to manufacturers: you’re not fooling anyone, we all know it’s plastic. Embrace it and stop trying to make it look like wood.) and there’s been some (arguable) progress in the chlorine smell, maintenance headaches and operating costs. Our decision was based on the seating options, the number of jets and, as best as we can tell, how reputable the company is. And price, of course. We figure all hot tubs will need repairs eventually, so we just need to be able to get the replacement parts. Clearwater is local and if we buy directly from them, they do the repairs themselves, which seems better than the hit-or-miss service you get from a dealer. Clearwater seems to be higher-end, but still doesn’t have the reputation that Jacuzzi, Sundance and Hot Springs do, but again, it’s hard to tell if you’re paying more for them because of the quality or because of better marketing.</p>

<p>Most of the hot tubs that Schuchart/Dow installs are custom-made and accompany a pool. We don’t have a pool and all the construction labor and equipment to subsidize the cost of the hot tub, so building a custom hot tub would be at least twice as expensive as buying a manufactured hot tub, and that’s without the design costs. A custom hot tub would also not have the contoured seating that a manufactured one has and it’d be harder to find a repairman for a custom hot tub. So we went with a manufactured one. We planned to use the house’s boiler and a heat exchanger that we’ve already installed in the house to heat the hot tub and avoid the electricity costs of heating a hot tub too, but we discovered that that will void the manufacturer’s warranty since they are self-contained units. Hot tub manufacturers cite a $10-17/mo cost to keep a hot tub heated 24x7 and argue that they’re so efficient these days, there’s no reason to use a heat exchanger. It’s plausible if they’re insulated well, but I will be shocked if it costs that little in reality. The heat exchanger would have essentially been free. Fortunately, our HVAC contractor, Premier, who has been fantastic throughout the project, is willing to remove the heat exchanger and refund us the cost.</p>

<p>We went to the house to check on the progress. It’s still mostly painting that’s going on so not a lot is happening. They built the island top to hold the marble so we can now see the actual size of the island (it’s big!), they’re building the laundry room shelving and appliances are being installed. The heating pipes in the basement were painted and we’ve been wary of the color that the designers picked, a purplish/greyish color. I don’t understand why we can’t just pick a simple black, but I trust their opinions on color over my own. But I saw it and hated it – it was brown! After a bit of head-scratching, we figured out that the painters used the wrong color. Every sub-contractor has been great so far, but Mark’s been having trouble with the painters almost from the beginning and we got a firsthand look at how they all pointed fingers at each other and offered excuses for using the wrong color.</p>

<p>Aside: I’ve never understood why humans spend so much energy denying mistakes and so little fixing mistakes. It’s as if they try to pretend they’re perfect and admitting to a mistake is a crack in their facade. No (intelligent) person has ever been convinced another person is perfect, so you look like a jackass pretending to be. Besides, mistakes always happen, so if you haven’t made a mistake, you haven’t done much work. And mistakes are the best way to learn, so if you haven’t made a mistake, you haven’t had the opportunity to learn, so you’re probably bad at what you do. So be proud of your mistakes, learn from them and everyone’s better-off (and there’s a lot less whining and resentment).</p>

<p>After wasting 5 minutes listening to three guys try to avoid blame, Mark found the can with the correct color and, because it was quittin’ time, there was a short struggle to get them to paint some of it on the pipes now so we could see it and decide on the color once and for all. I was getting tired of their finger-pointing and was about to open the can and do the sample myself, but Mark said he wanted to make the laziest guy do it. If they hadn’t wasted 5 minutes denying the mistake, they could have taken 30 seconds to paint a sample of the correct color and left 4.5 minutes earlier.</p>

<p>After that was all done and as the paint dried, I still didn’t like the color. Mark says that Tom Kundig always uses one black (like he always uses one white that we’re using for the walls) so we’re going to get a sample of that and compare it. I’ll be surprised if Tom’s color isn’t the right color.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>I hadn’t been to the house <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/05/12/thursday-in-seattle/">since last week</a> so I wanted to go check on progress. We also got all our Lutron outlets, switches and dimmers so we had to deliver those to the house so the electrician can start installing them next week or the week after. We stopped at The Beer Junction to get some Friday beers for the guys at the house and, with no traffic at all, were at the house 15 minutes later, all the way from West Seattle. Incidentally, today was <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.com/thebigblog/2011/05/20/seattle-finally-hits-70-degrees/">Seattle’s first 70° day of 2011</a>, the second-longest span in history, short of the record by 3 days.</p>

<p>The security company was by this week to do yet more stuff to appease the annoying insurance company: they set it up to automatically arm itself at 5pm in case the contractors forget (which they hadn’t done once in the entire 10 months they’ve been working there), they put up big signs around the house telling thieves that cameras are watching them and they replaced the landline connection with a cellular connection for “signal continuity” – which we would have done anyway since we only have a landline now for Mark’s fax (ugh!) machine.</p>

<p>The kids’ bedrooms are finished being painted. Except for a minor problem with the colors in Hudson’s room and some touch-up that needs to be done, we’re happy with how they turned out. The kids’ bathrooms are also painted and complete, except for electrical and plumbing trim-outs. They’re finishing up the shelving in the kids’ closets. The master bedroom ceiling and trim is painted and the bathroom wall tile is almost done, so it can be painted soon. The painters were prepping the attic and basement to be painted next week and applying (smelly) special primer to the pipes in the basement.</p>

<p>The face of the powder room vanity was installed. Gay and I went to Crosscut Hardwoods to pick out the wood (walnut) <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/02/18/two-breweries/">in February</a> and it’s finally done and looks great. Kurt was finishing up the shelving in the kitchen pantry; all that’s left for that is to put the steel on the fronts of the shelves.</p>

<p>One of Hudson’s teeth is turning black, presumably from one of his many falls, so Gay took him to the dentist while I stayed at the house. It turns out that while his tooth is dying, it’s nothing to worry about unless the gums get infected or develop and abscess, which it doesn’t appear to have happened yet, but told us what to look for. This is a new thing for us, but the dentist says this is very common and that we’ll now notice teeth in other kids that are darker than others too.</p>

<p>A few minutes before Gay got back from the dentist, Scot Eckley arrived to go over the latest revision of the landscaping design. We made some minor changes and there’s some details left to be worked out, but we should have enough decided that Schuchart/Dow can put the waterproof membrane on top of the garage and start building the decks and concrete walls.</p>

<p>We stopped at the park at St. Joseph’s to let the kids play for a half-an-hour before we went to <a href="http://www.smithseattle.com/">Smith</a> for dinner.</p>

            <p>Eva is 5 months old today. Her temperament is still very good and she’s sleeping for long stretches at night more and more often. She is much more active when put in one of her play circle things, spinning around on her own and playing with the toys. She’s not as ticklish as she was a month ago, it’s hard to get her to giggle anymore when we tickle her tummy or neck. She’s started eating solids on occasion and has been very good at it, not spitting it most of it up like the other kids did. She is more responsive when you call her name and turns to look at you.</p>
