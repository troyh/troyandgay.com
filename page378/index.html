          <p>We saw <a href="http://www.realwomenhavecurves.com/">Real Women Have Curves</a>, a movie about an intelligent not-skinny Mexican teenage girl living in Los Angeles whose own mother repeatedly disparages her weight thinking it will prevent her from getting married. It’s cute and simple and short, but it’s undeveloped and unsurprising. It’s more about a modern girl’s ambitions versus her mother’s older generation expectations for females.</p>

          <p><a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2084727/">Slate on Linux surpassing Macs as the #2 desktop OS</a>. He’s right, Linux will surpass the Mac, if it hasn’t already. But Apple doesn’t need to worry, Microsoft does. Few people are trying to decide between a Mac and Linux – they’re deciding between Linux and Windows. The appeal of the Mac is great design and usability, something nobody will beat Apple at anytime soon. Certainly not Linux. Not even the wealthy Microsoft has been able to match Apple on that turf. But Windows is not well-designed, so it’s clearly susceptible to Linux’s similarly-poorly-designed GUI.</p>

          <p>We’ve been soliciting painters to have our house painted this summer. Two more today and one yesterday. It’s amazing how different painters can generate wildly different estimates for the same exact job.</p>

<p>Now we need to pick a color.</p>

          <p>Had dinner at John &amp; Deborah’s last  night. And played a game of Trivial Pursuit with their son, J.T., who teamed up with me to squash John, Deborah &amp; Gay. Well, we won by one pie piece and J.T. took advantage of the wine they were drinking to give us a little help with more useful die rolling. But we won and that’s what matters. :-)</p>
