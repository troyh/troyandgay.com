              <p>The internet and democratic software are visible players in the 2004 Presidential election. This is  a far cry from just the 1996 election where no candidate even knew what the internet was and few even used computers. But 2004 is different. Clark is <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,61723,00.html">starting an open source project</a> to build campaign software for anyone to use. And Dean, the most internet-aware candidate, has been <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.01/dean.html">aggressively using the internet</a> in his campaign. Coincidentally, we were notified by our ad agency a couple days ago that the Dean campaign has bought advertising on <a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a>. We’re going to be part of US History as I’m sure the internet will continue to play a larger role in politics. (I’d better study up on Dean’s platform cuz I’m sure we’ll be accused of being Dean-supporters because of this).</p>

              <p>The Betty MacDonald Farm, recently profiled in this Seattle Times story, is our neighbor (that gravel lane mentioned is the shared unincorporated road to our house too) and the proprietor, Judith, gave us a lovely Christmas wreath the other day that she made from boxwood.   (Too bad they don’t have any of the accompanying photos from the print story online.  I didn’t see them and heard they were great.)  Glad Judith got some good press!  It was one of the fir trees Judith planted 10 years ago that is now our Christmas tree – how country is that, to have a neighbor who sells Christmas trees you can cut fresh and walk home with.  We’ve said it before, but it sure is nice to have such good neighbors and friends.</p>

<p>Tomorrow Troy and I are hosting our annual Neighborhood Cookie Exchange Party.  I love it here.</p>
