This last sentence repeats for several pages in the selected bright red 32 point type(without any asterisks).  They are complaining because we’ve had to remove their account for abusive behavior towards other members, so their recipes now appear as posted by “Recipezaar” instead of their name.  What is really adorable about the note is that they became abusive because another member pointed out that a recipe this person had posted originally appeared on another website.  Awww, so sweet.</p>

            <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/OCEAN45C.jpg" alt="OCEAN45C.jpg" />When the seasons change (and I get sick), I blow my runny nose too much and get regular bloody noses.  My doctor told me to buy <a href="http://www.flemingcompany.com/Product/ocean.htm">“Ocean” a nasal spray</a> at the pharmacy to combat the problem.  A look at the ingredients tells you it really is “ocean”, just saline solution in a nasal spray bottle.  I think it is a beautiful name.
Now a Seattle company is working on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/13/science/13SPRA.html?ex=1384059600&amp;en=258e4b7b918295f6&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">a nasal spray that will curb hunger</a> by getting the “you’re full” hormone into the blood stream.  Ingenious.  And a <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/10/001780.php">genuine good use of technology</a>.</p>
