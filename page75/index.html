          <p>Today is our 6th Wedding Anniversary. Happy Anniversary, Gay! That 6 years we dated before getting married doesn’t seem to long anymore. :) <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/07/29/more-house-work/">We went out to dinner on Thursda</a>y and we’ll have a barbecue dinner with the kids tonight. I even cleaned the grill!</p>

<p>We wrote our own ceremony and marriage vows for our wedding and lost the original copy. Since we were married, <em>two</em> couples who attended the wedding were divorced and <em>both</em> told us that our wedding vows were a factor in their decision to divorce. What did we write??! And people actually listened to them??? We recently found the paper our officiant read from packed away in our filing cabinet, so I thought I’d write them down so they’re a little more permanent. Be careful if you’re married, you might end up getting divorced if you read them.</p>

<p>The ceremony:</p>

<blockquote>Today is the commemoration of a private union created by love and kept by will. The true marriage is already manifest in Troy &amp; Gay's relationship. The ceremony is a formal articulation of the love and the pledge these two have made for a lifetime. Today they choose to make that commitment public and forever.

Troy &amp; Gay enter into this union with the full understanding that marriage is not mandatory to unify their lives or codify their relationship. Troy &amp; Gay enter into this union recognizing that they are fortunate to have the right to marry, a right some of their closest friends are denied. Marriage has been recognized by society, religions, creeds, customs and government throughout history. And today Troy &amp; Gay are entering into a legal union that is recognized by the State. However, Troy &amp; Gay are marrying not because it is meaningful to others, but because it is meaningful to them.

Troy &amp; Gay, like all in attendance who have experience in marriage, realize that the commitment they are making is the most important promise two poeple can make to each other. Marriage is a responsibility and an honor, one that deserves to be made in a ceremony and in celebration with family and friends.

Marriage is not simply a private affair between two individuals. Marriage brings together two families and two families of friends. Today is a time for all of us to share in Troy and Gay's commitment to each other by offering them our continued support, love and best wishes in their lives together.

Gay and Troy, marriage is something beyond the excitement and romance of being deeply in love. Marriage means caring as much about the welfare and happiness of your life partner as about your own. Real love does not result in the total absorption or possession of each other; it is about two independent people looking in the same direction together. Love makes burdens lighter because you divide them. It makes joys more intense because you share them. It makes you stronger, so you can do things you dare not risk alone.

Troy and Gay, a good marriage depends on many factors. Primary among them are a strong friendship and mutual respect. Your love with grow deeper with time, but genuine closeness and a willingness to accept each other's strengths and weaknesses is the foundation for a lasting marriage.</blockquote>

<p>Troy’s vows:</p>

<blockquote>Gay, I marry you because you are my complement as well as my antithesis. You excite me, you challenge me, and you help me to understand myself.

I, Troy Hakala, vow that I will love and respect you. At all times, under all circumstances, I will be open and honest with you, support you in everything you do, and be your faithful and equal partner, as long as we both shall live, and then some. No splitting up.</blockquote>

<p>Gay’s vows:</p>

<blockquote>Troy, I marry you because you are the man I admire and adore. You make me laugh, you let me cry, you inspire me and make me a better person.

I, Gay Gilmore, vow that I will love and respect you. At all times, under all circumstances, I will be open and honest with you, support you in everything you do, and be your faithful and equal partner, as long as we both shall live, and then some. No splitting up.</blockquote>

<p>The “No splitting up” is something we promised to each other while on “vacation” in Cuba when we were separated and couldn’t find each other. No cell phones back then either. When we found each other again, we promised “no splitting up” so that doesn’t happen again on the trip. It stuck.</p>

The picture at the left is from when we first started dating twelve years ago.  Starting tomorrow we will be married for more days than we haven’t, so it is a tipping point for us.</p>

<p>Troy,</p>

<p>Thanks for giving me the best years of my life so far.  Each day is better than the <del>next</del> last. ;)</p>

<p>[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4844101425/)Back in the city for several reasons today. After stopping at West Seattle’s new beer store, <a href="http://www.thebeerjunction.com/">The Beer Junction</a>, to get a bunch of good beers (I love Seattle’s beer scene!), we went to <a href="http://www.tothconstruction.com/">Toth Construction</a>’s office. We’re having them bid on the project too and they had their proposal ready. Then we went to the house were we met with the architects, Dan and Todd, to see their ideas.
<!-- more --></p>

<p>They made some improvements to our design for the kitchen/family room. We like their design to remove the wall between the kitchen and the dining room. Our design had just a 2nd doorway but left the wall mostly intact because we wanted to have the dishwasher and sink hidden behind the wall. They shifted some things around and showed us how it would remain hidden but we could open up the wall. They also made the island longer and they should come up with a really cool dining room-facing side of the island. They did a better job with the family room too and had some good ideas for making it an indoor-outdoor living area. This room is going to be fantastic.</p>

<p>On the master bedroom and bath, our design was better. They tried some different things but we all agreed they didn’t work as well. They need to refine our design and the master bed and bath should be done.</p>

<p>They didn’t change our design for the basement much, although they did a much better job with the bathroom area. Before today, Gay and I realized that the gym area wasn’t going to work well as designed by us. Their design had the same problem. We talked about this for a while and all agreed that the gym should move. I think the basement design is all but done at this point.</p>

<p>The powder room design on the main floor was good (Tom’s quick solution from <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/07/21/first-day-in-the-new-house/">the last meeting</a>), but the space is so tight it’s hard to fit the sink and toilet in the space well. Gay and I made some changes to that and they agreed. I think that’s done.</p>

<p>Their design for the attic was close to ours but it’s still a difficult area to design for our offices, bathroom and a guest room. This will take some more work and thinking.</p>

<p>In other news, Qwest activated the phone line today which is required for the security system, which is required by the insurance company. The security system will be activated tomorrow. All the fixtures and miscellaneous stuff we gave to Second Use was removed.</p>

<p>Demolition is progressing. The master bath is down to the studs. Most of the attic ceiling was taken down so that we could see the height of the peaked roof. That looks great, but the roof is being held up by the cross-ties, which ruin the effect of a cathedral ceiling. We talked about a solution and we’re leaning towards removing them all and replacing them with cables. We’ll see if the architects have any better ideas.</p>

<p>After this meeting, we left the house and went out to dinner at <a href="http://www.restaurantzoe.com/">Restaurant Zoe</a> to celebrate our 6th wedding anniversary. Technically, our anniversary is Saturday but we didn’t want to come into the city again especially since the dreaded <a href="http://www.seafair.com/">Seafair</a> is this weekend when the city is overrun with yahoos.</p>

          <p>We’re giving most of the plumbing and electrical fixtures and some other things to <a href="http://www.seconduse.com/">Second Use</a> and they’re picking it all up tomorrow. This is handy because they do all the removal so we don’t have to pay the labor to have it removed and they pay us a portion of the fair market value for the stuff (and then they re-sell it).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4834801998/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4090/4834801998_33796939f3.jpg" alt="Sitz bath" /></a></p>

<p>Kelly and Stuart are building a house right now so we offered the stuff to her too and she wanted a few items. So we met her, Stuart and his brothers at the house so they could take it before tomorrow. She got a 6-foot clawfoot tub (heavy!), a sink, the dishwasher (which was pretty new) and the <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002299.htm">Sitz bath</a> that the kids liked to play in.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The <a href="http://www.adt.com/">ADT</a> guy also came to the house to get us set up with the security system, which is required by the insurance company during the renovation.</p>

<p>We hired a neighbor kid to mow the lawn at least until we move in. He came over so we could meet and mowed it for the first time this evening. I used to have my own little lawn-mowing business when I was a kid so I love to help another kid in his business.</p>

<p>Megan also stopped by and we went out to dinner with her. Megan <a href="http://www.lbreport.com/obits/davewod.htm">lost a good friend</a> suddenly on Sunday morning to a brain aneurysm and needed a distraction. Gay knew him from high school too and I met him at <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/02/jon-megans-wedding/">Megan &amp; Jon’s wedding</a> less than 2 years ago – we sat at the same table with him, his girlfriend, his brother and his wife. A really nice guy. He was in good shape, only 40 and just had his first baby in February. It’s yet another reminder of how short life is and how suddenly and unexpectedly it can end.</p>

<p>We got the first look at the demolition progress. The kitchen is almost completely demolished, the room behind it is mostly demolished, they’ve removed the surface of one of the walls in the basement (proving it’s not load-bearing) and the master bathroom is mostly demolished. They also removed the carpet from the master bedroom and discovered a well-preserved maple floor. Nice. As suspected, the house seems to have zero insulation in the exterior walls. They just didn’t use insulation in 1909. This is important because there’s not much point in replacing the single-pane windows with more insulating double-pane windows if the walls themselves aren’t insulated. We will probably want to add insulation and put it in the rooms where we aren’t renovating with as little destruction to those areas as possible.</p>
