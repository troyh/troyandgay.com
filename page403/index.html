            <p>Had friends over for dinner last night: Megan, her boyfriend John, Serene, Dave, Reid, Eric, Valerie and lots of dogs. Megan &amp; John brought appetizers with her roasted red pepper dip &amp; bruschetta, Serene &amp; Dave brought a great salad and growlers of yummy local micro-beer. Eric &amp; Valerie brought us a bottle of wine straight from France, which we stashed away for later. We barbecued hamburgers and had <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/recipe/getrecipe.zsp?id=52840">Cocoa-Buttermilk Cake</a> for dessert.</p>

<p>I woke up at 6am and couldn’t get back to sleep (probably a function of the wine). I stayed up til 9am, did some work, and then fell asleep til after noon.</p>

            <p>Gay ran off to Seattle to see friends tonight. I stayed home working. Had a couple <a href="http://www.fullers.co.uk/">Fuller’s</a> beers (an 1845 and an ESB) and worked all night listening to <a href="http://www.radiohead.com/">Radiohead</a>, <a href="http://www.roxymusic.co.uk/">Roxy Music</a> and <a href="http://www.arabstrap.co.uk/">Arab Strap</a>.</p>

            <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/us.JPG" alt="where it started: chicago" />Well, the “and” part, the “.com” part is still fairly new.  I’d pretty much say that “and” is the best conjunction to ever come into my life – no I’d definitely say it – and the “.com” is the best extension too.  Thanks Troy, I love U…nix!</p>

            <p>The new caching mechanism has been running well for the last few days. Our main goal was to relieve the load on the database side, which we have definitely done. But of course, that load doesn’t magically go away so it was transferred to the web server side. That’s good as their are more web servers than database servers and the work that the web server has to do is much more straightforward than the database server’s work. But more optimization/improvements are going to be beneficial.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>After dinner, we came home and finished watching Harry Potter 2. As with the first movie, it was well-made, the cinematography and special effects were very good and was entertaining throughout the almost 2.5 hours. But again like the first movie, it’s definitely a kids’ movie. The characters are a little too shallow and the storyline is very simple with a happy ending. It’s a “thinking kids’ movie”, but a kids’ move nonetheless.</p>
