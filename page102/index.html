<p>We had the usuals: turkey, sweet potatoes, green beans, cranberry sauce, stuffing and pumpkin pie. The kids didn’t like the sweet potatoes but I thought they were fantastic with brown sugar and pecans on top.</p>

              <p>We had another meeting with Tom and Dan to see the results of “last week’s changes”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/11/17/architecture-meeting-3/. It looks pretty good but we need to think about room sizes. The total square footage is <em>way</em> too big, we need to shave off about 1,700 square feet. We also think the kitchen will change a little because they think we’ve designed it too small. We left with some tracing paper, a scale and some guidelines/advice about spaces and sizes and we’re going to see if we can try some kitchen ideas on our own. We also scaled back the area around the garage to avoid moving too much dirt to level it.</p>

<p>Because of holidays and vacations, we won’t be meeting with them until January. They’ve done some early drawings for the elevations but won’t show them to us yet. Tom did give us a general idea of the roofline he’s thinking about, though. Hopefully we’ll see those ideas on paper then.</p>

              <p>My dad was released from the hospital after his kidney-removal surgery and the doctors confirmed that, while the tumor was malignant, it hadn’t yet spread to any other organs. A previous test confirmed that it hadn’t spread to his bones either. So he’s cancer-free!</p>

              <p>There is someone who works at the Associated Press, probably more than one!, that makes a decision about which news stories are important enough to be an alert for mobile users. And they decided that Oprah’s imminent announcement to end her show in 2 years is worthy:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4118700382/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2475/4118700382_96135a13e5_o.jpg" alt="AP thinks this is critical news" /></a></p>

<p>I can’t decide if this is dumber than their alert about <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/10/09/ap-mobile-notifications/">golf in the 2016 Olympics</a>. Does this even merit an alert if you work for Oprah and will lose your job in 2011?</p>

<p>They accept (and seem to ignore) feedback at <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#109;&#110;&#110;&#102;&#101;&#101;&#100;&#098;&#097;&#099;&#107;&#064;&#097;&#112;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#109;&#110;&#110;&#102;&#101;&#101;&#100;&#098;&#097;&#099;&#107;&#064;&#097;&#112;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>.</p>

              <p>After the meeting at Olson Kundig, we went to <a href="http://www.steelheaddiner.com/">Steelhead Diner</a> for dinner. They participate in the <a href="http://www.dinearoundseattle.org/">Dine Around Seattle</a> promotion that a lot of Seattle restaurants do in November. This year, it’s 3-for-30, or 3 courses for $30. From <a href="http://www.dinearoundseattle.org/restaurants_show.php?rdx=31">their menu</a>, I had the clam chowder and Gay had the fried oysters for appetizers and I had the salmon and Gay had the ribeye steak for the entree. They were out of the chocolate pecan pie dessert that I wanted so I got the spiced pumpkin creme brulee and Gay got the chocolate mousse. Everything was delicious.</p>
