          <p>Another Tour de France is over. Contador wins, Andy Schleck is second and Armstrong is third. Contador has won two Tours de France and the Vuelta Espana and the Giro d’Italia – he’s won all four major stage races that he’s raced. Very impressive.</p>

<p>We went to France in 2005 to see what I thought would be Lance’s last time on the podium, but there he is up there again in 2009. He’s the second-oldest person to ever be on the podium. As it has been for the last 15 (!) years I’ve been watching, Phil Liggett and Paul Sherwen were who I looked forward to listening to for several hours every evening. I miss them already.</p>

<p>Lance has already announced he’ll race the TdF again next year for Team Radio Shack and I suspect Bruyneel and most of the Astana team will be on that team too. In spite of his victory, Contador may have a hard time finding a new team next year – no team director wants to deal with a guy who disobeys him and Contador will likely discover why having your team not think you’re an ass is beneficial in a stage race. He’s a very good cyclist and could win a few more TdFs if he can mature over the off-season.</p>

<p>My prediction for the winner next year is Andy Schleck.</p>

<p>Time for football season to start…</p>

          <p>Hudson is 11 months old today. Since last month, he’s cruising very well now and loves to practice walking. We hold his hands and he will walk all around the house and yard and get upset if you want to quit before he does. He  crawls fast and can even start to climb stairs. For eating, he rarely takes food from us anymore and now prefers to take food himself and feed himself. This is a welcome change!</p>

          <p>Gay and her mom took the kids to <a href="http://www.pdza.org/">Point Defiance Zoo</a> to spend the day with Ruth’s cousin Linda, her grandkids, her daughter, Julie, and her son-in-law, Hans, and their kid, Gracelyn.</p>

          <p>Lance did okay and got back to #3 overall and Contador impressively won the time trial. Mont Ventoux on Saturday could shake things up but it looks like the podium will be Contador, Schleck and Armstrong, in that order. 3rd place is not bad for a 37 year-old guy who hasn’t raced in 4 years.</p>
