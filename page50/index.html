        <article>
          <p>An inspection for our Vashon house was scheduled for this afternoon and takes 4-5 hours, so we decided to go visit the house for the afternoon. Gay took the kids to French camp and Gay and I took the ferry over to Seattle to the house. Kelly picked the kids up at noon and took them over to meet us at the house.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5886066101/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5028/5886066101_49cbaff5a6.jpg" alt="IMG_3366" /></a></p>

<p>Kelly took the kids to the park a couple blocks away and Gay helped me with the in-ceiling speakers. We took down all the speakers to put a piece of insulation behind each speaker, as recommended by the Noble Fidelity engineer to improve the bass (and provides some noise insulation to the floor above). In-ceiling speaker makers need to come up with an easier mounting system because it’s a two-person job – one person has to hold the speaker while the other attaches the wires, guides the wire into the hole and screws it in. It’s difficult to have two people on ladders right next to each other (although it’s nicer when it’s your wife that close to you) and it’s tiring to hold a speaker above your head, which is made worse by how delicate they are and a lack of comfortable handles. It’d be handy if the speakers had mounting brackets that held the speaker in place and allowed it to drop down freeing your hands to work the way some canned lighting housings do.</p>

<p>There’s lots of miscellaneous work going on at the house. Cabinetry hardware is still being installed, only some of which has arrived. Most of the kitchen pulls are going to be very late as they take 10-12 weeks to make after they’re ordered and we only ordered them last week. So we’ll have blue tape as pulls on most of the kitchen cabinetry for a couple months. I got to use my closet cabinetry since that hardware is all installed. The big hanging pullouts and mirror work great and are easy to pull out and push in.</p>

<p>All the appliances are installed and we got to play with the stove. One beverage fridge in the butler’s pantry was DOA, so the replacement will be delivered and installed next week. The washer and dryer are installed – those are nice-looking! The closet shelving and hardware is all installed in every room. The steel was put on the moving wall in the attic. The sliding doors are all painted – those just need bumpers to be installed on the tracks to keep them from hitting the edges and walls. All the fixtures are installed in the kitchen and bathrooms but there’s still a little bit of plumbing work to be done here and there. The basement shower glass was installed, with a cut-out handle that turned out well, so as to avoid having a pull on the glass. All the toilets are installed, except the master bath one that was cracked, so we’ll be missing a toilet in the master for a while. The kitchen tile and the master bath tile are all done and grouted. The master vanities are being constructed and should be done by move-in day but it looks like the decorative steel will be  late. The decorative steel in the pantry is installed. The garage doors were installed, except for one opener that they didn’t have in stock (oddly, it’s the standard one, not the more rare jackshaft one), so I got to open and close it – smooth and quiet. Bill finished all the electrical and put really cool industrial light fixtures throughout the garage. The floor guys arrived in the afternoon to put the final coat on all the stairs.</p>

<p>Next week is a short week but will be busy finishing all the loose ends. I think we’re going to have people still running through the house for a couple weeks after we move in. Then the exterior work can begin and, since I’ll be living there, maybe I can do some work on the decks.</p>

<p>On the way to the house, we stopped at The Beer Junction to get some beer to stock the newly-installed fridge. At the end of the day, we had a beer with Mark while admiring all the progress. Thanks to the beer, I also got to use one of the <a href="http://www.totousa.com/Neorest/Neorest550.aspx">Toto Neorest</a> toilets for the first time; never having to touch a toilet to use it makes you wonder why it took so long – why should people have to touch the most unsanitary object in their house? 7 days until move-in, we’re getting excited!</p>

<p>On the way home, we went to Talarico’s for pizza dinner. Hudson missed his usual nap so was very tired and fell asleep minutes after leaving the restaurant while Havana watched Toy Story 2 on the iPad.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Just like <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2010/11/06/octane-fitness-err-3/">last time</a>, the Octane Fitness elliptical started giving me the infamous “Err 3” after workouts. Just like last time, it got progressively worse and happened more and more frequently, but I could reset it enough to use it. Then the tension feature suddenly started to always be at the highest tension, which is so high I couldn’t run for more than few minutes. I called Octane Fitness and, again, quickly got a hold of a competent tech support guy. He knew exactly what the tension problem was – broken cables inside the brake. He said he’d send me replacements for free. I then said the Err 3 is back and he immediately said he’d send me another new stride motor, my 4th!, free of charge.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5891550336/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6034/5891550336_bf26263736.jpg" alt="Octane Fitness Stride motor" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I got the parts yesterday, installed them fairly quickly, and was up and (fake) running again. Gotta love Octane Fitness’ customer support! I’ve now repaired almost every part on this elliptical at least once. I can’t switch to another brand now because I know this thing so well and can easily repair it myself.</p>

<p>The brake cables wearing out is expected, they’re just the stranded steel cables that bicycle brakes have so they don’t last forever when they’re constantly being used. But I don’t understand why I go through so many stride motors. I seem to be needing a new one every 8-10 months these days. It doesn’t make sense given that I never even change the stride (although it adjusts it automatically at times) and the motors are simple things. 10 miles/day doesn’t seem excessive for an elliptical. I think it’s a bug in the software that erroneously reports “Err 3”.</p>

          <p>Havana and Hudson have French camp this week so we could leave Eva with Kelly and we went to the house to keep working on the stuff I need to do. Gay helped me get all the CAT6 wires punched into the patch panel, a tedious job, and then to test all the wires through the house. They all tested fine. Then I hooked up all the speakers, except for the foyer speakers, to a receiver and we tested those and they all work too. Not bad for my first (and last) low-voltage sub-contractor job. Gay worked out all the issues with the electrical parts and finalized the cabinetry hardware positions with Mark. 
<!-- more --></p>

<p>The progress on the house continued with the many final details. Tim finished up the kitchen window trim and the guest room sliding door hardware. The stone guy was cutting the holes in the counters for the plumbing fixtures and finished installing and sealing the powder room stone. 12th Ave Iron was templating for the kitchen sliding door cladding. Twisted Metalworks is halfway done installing the kitchen pantry shelving steel facia. The tile guys were finishing up the kitchen tile and grouting the master bath tile, now that the grout color was selected. Bill, the electrician, was finishing up the garage electrical. The basement step treads were installed and Kurt finished the final piece at the top of the stairs. The bathroom fixtures (towel rods, toilet paper holders) were getting installed. All 7 (!) thermostats are installed. The painters were doing touch-up painting. And the stucco guys started coloring the exterior!</p>

<p>I still have some work to do for the speakers, install that last piece of ladder rack in the basement, need to pick TVs and amplifiers and get them installed, and schedule Comcast and DirecTV for installations.</p>

          <p>Today, Gay and I left the kids at home with Kelly and took the 8:40a ferry, optimistic to have a more productive day at the house than <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/06/23/tiring-thursday/">yesterday</a>. Traffic was better today, so it was already looking up. After a quick stop at Home Depot, we got to the house and quickly got to work. We got all the wire pulled into the room again and we identified all the cables again because the labels were removed when I had to cut them and pull them back. Gay ran to the Lexus dealer in Bellevue to return loaner car and pick up our car from the service department while I finished installing the speakers in the ceilings, now that the kitchen and family room ceilings had been painted. This was a much more productive day!</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>Lots of progress on the house this week: master bath tile was finished and most of the butler’s pantry and kitchen tile was finished, the sliding door hardware in the attic was finished and installed, the painters finished the dining room, kitchen and family room and the few radiators we needed painted, the HVAC guys were installing the thermostats and had to fix some tough electrical issues with the boiler that I didn’t bother to ask the details about, the electrician put most of the electrical outlets in the garage and Colin reframed the garage doors preparing for the new garage doors next week, Tim and Kurt did miscellaneous woodwork (closet shelving, the base trim on the main floor, sauna exterior wall, the risers for the basement stairs). The stone guys did two-thirds of the powder room wall.</p>

<p>The floor guys are going to work on Saturday to put the final coat on the floors so all the protection was taken off the floors, so we got to see all the floors for the first time since they were refinished.</p>

<p>Next week, the garage doors should get installed, the electrical should be done in the garage, the rest of the appliances should be installed, some more decorative steel should be installed, possibly the steel basement stair guard rails will get built and maybe even installed (probably not), all the tile and stone work should be done and the exterior should get colored. And I may get the speakers all hooked up and playing music!</p>

<p>Only two weeks before we’re scheduled to move-in, so it’s crunch time and they have lots of little things to get finished. I also need to decide on and order all the A/V equipment so I can install it the last week.</p>

<p>We also got a surprise gift from Schuchart/Dow…. Katie stopped by while we were there and gave us our very own Schuchart/Dow jackets! When the project first began, there were a bunch of SD employees meeting with us all wearing these jackets. They look pretty sharp and commented on how nice they are. They explained that the employees get one of these jackets on their 5th anniversary. The men’s are nice Carhartt black jackets with the Shuchart/Dow logo (I love their logo) stitched on the lower back and their names stitched on the pocket. I got one of those. Gay got a ladies Patagonia black jacket with the logo on the back and her name stitched on the left arm. We were pretty excited about those. Gay hasn’t gotten any SD gear, but I’ve made out like a bandit: they’ve given me two work shirts, a more casual Dickies work jacket and even a hardhat. I love wearing the SD shirt when I work at the house because the few sub-contractors who don’t know who I am think I’m just another SD employee, not the homeowner, so I get treated like everyone else rather than have my butt kissed as the homeowner.</p>
