              <p>Today I’m at the meaningful age of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)">42</a>. I’m officially not young any more. Looking back, I was a kid being pulled by a fire inside trying my best with my limited abilities and somehow ended up having a fun, lucky and very fortunate life…</p>

<blockquote>

&gt; 
&gt; I want to dance with this fire
Because it's all that I know
As the spotlight turns towards me
I just try my best to show
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; We are lost
We are freaks
We are crippled
We are weak
We are the heirs
To all the world
&gt; 
&gt; </blockquote>

<p>Looking forward, I want to build a new fire and show my kids and help them build theirs. </p>

<blockquote>

&gt; 
&gt; Let's go
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; Build a fire
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; Down on the empty beach where the waves are crashing high
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; White heat, purify as the sparks fly up into the great black sky
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; Sacrifice these crutches to the crackling flame
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; Stand as silhouettes against the dawn
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; It's far too late to try to sleep now
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; It seems I'm never tired anymore
&gt;

<p>This old song from my youth always seemed so relevant to me. It inspired me then and still seems to.</p>

              <p>Now that we have kids and live in a neighborhood that does trick-or-treating, we’re starting a tradition of decorating the house. Our street doesn’t go as all-out as 16th and 17th Avenues do here, but most houses decorate significantly. Since our house was built by the guy who created Rainier Beer, we thought it’d be fitting to make it into a haunted brewery.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/6302601273/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6040/6302601273_361a3ba3f9.jpg" alt="Happy Halloween!" /></a></p>

<p>We also wanted to make it fun for parents too, so we’ll have a keg and pour beers for parents who have to walk around watching their kids get all the treats.</p>

<p>We didn’t have many props this year, but I thought the famous Rainier R would be appropriate. It turns out that no kids knew what it was for, but all the older people sure did. It didn’t dawn on me that anyone under the age of 12 or so never saw <a href="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/50291_250186381337_6405329_n.jpg">the R on top of the Rainier brewery</a> since it was bought by Tully’s Coffee and <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Rainier_Brewery_04A.jpg/220px-Rainier_Brewery_04A.jpg">replaced with a T</a>. We’ll need to do more next year to make it more brewery-like. I also made the R flicker, as if the electricity was not working properly. I used a modified dimmer controlled by a photocell triggered by a flame light bulb, copied from <a href="http://www.hauntedillinois.com/lightflicker.php">this site</a>.</p>

<p>Megan and Jon came over to help us give out candy, drink and serve beers. Gay and I took the kids up and down the street for their trick-or-treating while Megan and Jon manned the beer and were around while Eva went to bed for the night. Havana dressed as a unicorn and Hudson dressed as a stegosaurus. Gay and I dressed as brewery workers with coveralls and Rainier Beer patches sewn on. Hudson and Havana stayed up later than normal and also helped give out candy to the older kids coming to the door.</p>

<p>We only got a pony keg, thinking we wouldn’t get many drinkers, but we almost finished it. We got some dry ice for the keg hoping that it’d give off a smoke to look like a cauldron or something, but the effect didn’t quite work. We also stupidly dumped the dry ice on top of the keg and 10 minutes later the tap was frozen so we couldn’t pour any beer. It took us 15 minutes to thaw it out. I estimate we poured 40 beers and some people came back two and three times for refills. A couple people assumed it was Rainier Beer and politely refused until they realized it was Manny’s Pale Ale.</p>

<p>We had lots of kids and gave out almost all our candy to at least 9:30pm. Some neighbors came by just for the beer too. It was pretty fun and we’re already looking forward to doing it again next year.</p>

              <p>Hudson had his tonsils and adenoids out this morning. That’s a Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy, what the doctors refer to as a “T&amp;A”. You’d think doctors would know that abbreviation.</p>

<p>He couldn’t eat any breakfast do he wasn’t happy. We checked in at 8:45a and he was given anesthesia at 9:55a. Surgery was over by 10:25a and we could see him at 10:50a.</p>

<p>He wasn’t feeling well but fell asleep in Gay’s arms after 15 minutes after being given pain-killers.</p>

<p>He was hooked up to a monitor that checked his heart rate and the oxygen in his blood. When he slept, it dropped low enough once that they wanted him to spend the night in the hospital.</p>

<p>An ambulance took him 2 blocks to Swedish hospital and we were in his room by 1:30p. We could have walked faster. This ambulance episode showed how bad our medical services are. The medic, trying to make conversation, told Gay that he’s “never had tonsils”. What kind of training do EMTs get that they don’t know that everyone has tonsils?</p>

<p>Kelly brought Havana, Eva and a night bag for Gay at 4:30p and I went home with them, leaving Gay to spend the night with him.</p>

<p>While at the hospital, his oxygen level was 97+%, which is normal, even while sleeping. So we think the anesthesiologist at the clinic over-reacted by recommending a night in the hospital. But it’s better to be safe than sorry. And apparently, unnecessary medical care is better for doctors to avoid potential lawsuits.</p>

<p><strong>11/4 Update:</strong> We got the bill. It cost $1,654.60 for the ambulance ride (we have to pay $300 of that). It’s amazing how much money our healthcare system wastes. The only thing dumber than this are the people who don’t think it needs an overhaul.</p>
