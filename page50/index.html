        <article>
          <p>Before Eva was born, they saw a cyst on her ovary during an ultrasound. Because we didn’t want to know the gender, they were careful not to explain anything in too much detail (and not say “ovary”!) but told us that it’s probably nothing to worry about and the OB/GYN kept reassuring us. Hard not to worry, though, especially when you have to not do any research about it for fear of discovering the gender.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>If she were a boy, a cyst would almost certainly mean cancer, but for girls they are <em>not uncommon</em> (which sounds like it’s common, but is really a doctor’s way of saying “it’s rare, but not so rare that we don’t know what to do”), since the job of an ovary is to create cysts every month to release an egg. They usually go away by themselves once the mother’s hormones are not coursing through the baby. Even the surgery, if necessary, is a simple operation they said. Even simple operations are scary to a parent and hard to think about doing to an infant.</p>

<p>We brought her to <a href="http://www.seattlechildrens.org/">Seattle Children’s Hospital</a> for a couple ultrasounds since she was born and we met with their resident expert on this, but it wasn’t shrinking. So they said to wait a little longer but will probably need surgery in a few months. And she had definitely lost one ovary, unfortunately.</p>

<p>But today, she had another ultrasound and it is now shrinking and will not need surgery after all! Good job, Eva!</p>

          <p>Eva is now 6 months old. She’s eating solid foods almost completely now, sleeps really well usually, has a great temperament, can pick up her binky and put it in her mouth on her own. We celebrated her half-birthday with a cake after dinner.</p>

<p>Mark and Lee, who are in Seattle visiting from London, came over for dinner and celebrated with us. They brought Eva a cute onesie, Hudson a polo shirt and Havana a counting game involving London buses. Hudson wanted to put his shirt on right away and Mark and Lee played the game with her and Hudson while we had cocktails.</p>

        <article>
          <p>My first Father’s Day with Eva. Gay and the kids made me breakfast in bed, but I was already up and dressed by the time they got to the room. They made me a Bloody Mary with the <a href="http://www.bakonvodka.com/">Bakon Vodka</a> that is so disgusting on its own that it can only be put in a Bloody Mary. I got an electric razor and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Go-F-Sleep-Adam-Mansbach/dp/1617750255">a book</a> to read to Eva, but it’s a book that should be read to all of the kids.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Selecting the exterior color has been delayed and we’re getting down to the wire. The stucco will be fog-coated, not painted (painting is bad for stucco), so it takes longer to get the colors matched and the material delivered. We finally got several color samples painted and hurried Nancy and My to come out to see them. They had time this afternoon, so Gay and I wanted to be there at the same time, so we decided to make another visit to the house today.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5842829918/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5157/5842829918_512420d300.jpg" alt="New vs Old stucco" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->
<p>I also got the chance to put the last pieces on the ladder rack and Gay could take some light fixtures to be repaired and rewired, pick up a few more window hardware pieces at Rejuvenation and a Costco supply trip. For the colors, I had my favorite color but everyone overruled me, which is usually what happens. They quickly picked one color, so no more samples (!) and we can get the ball rolling to order the material to make that color and get the stucco company started in a few weeks.</p>

        <article>
          <p>We had a meeting scheduled with the interior designers today so we went in early to stop by the house. There hasn’t been a lot of progress since <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/06/10/a-week-at-the-house/">we were there on Friday</a>. We saw some of the floors that were refinished over the weekend and they look great. And the stucco guys finished the patching they had to do where windows were removed and other places where the stucco had to be removed. They did a good job making it look like the old stucco, which they did by literally throwing the aggregate into the cement. Once it’s colored, it should look pretty close to the original. We’re still waiting for 12th Ave Iron to deliver and install the kitchen shelves, which is holding up the kitchen tile, which is holding up painting.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>We had a 2pm meeting at NB’s office and I got to see their new and bigger office on a new floor above for the first time that they moved into a few months ago. We went over the remaining issues, making some progress on decisions, and they came up with a good solution to the master bath shower door hardware that we’ve been dealing with. The unresolved issues with interior design are exterior color selection, dining room chandelier, kitchen bar stools, living room coffee table and several rugs, which are hard for me to accept because rugs are expensive and I can’t seem to get excited about any rug. On the way home, we made a quick stop a block away at Tom Douglas’ <a href="http://tomdouglas.com/index.php?page=seatown">Seatown</a> restaurant to see lights that NB likes for our dining room.</p>

<p>Once we got back to Vashon, we took the kids out to dinner at The Hardware Store.</p>
