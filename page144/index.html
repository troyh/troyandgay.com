              <p>Sarah Palin thought that Africa was a country and South Africa is a part, I assume the southern part, of the country of Africa. And get this, she couldn’t name the countries involved in NAFTA, which means she can’t name the three countries in North America. I imagine she thinks North America is comprised of Minnesota, Wisconsin, etc.</p>

<p>And Bill O’Reilly, not surprisingly, defends her ignorance of geography as something that can be taught to her. Yeah, it can be taught to children. But a 44 year-old college-educated person missed their chance to gain basic knowledge – she doesn’t have the <em>ability</em> to comprehend simple things. Oh, and by the way Bill O’Reilly, you brainless twit, she was trying to be the Vice President of our country! Is your brain on?! You’re such a bubblehead you work for Fox News, a fake news channel and I bet you think you’re a legitimate journalist.</p>

<p>Of course, this is all after the campaign is over and McCain lost. They were quite content to push this moron in the VP slot and let her lead the country even though they knew she was dumber than dirt. Country Last!</p>

<p>I still find it hard to believe Obama won. I watched the polls daily and saw Obama leading day after day, poll after poll. I believe polling is fairly accurate and, rationally, I found it hard to believe that every poll was wrong. Two things kept nagging at me:</p>

<!-- more -->

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The 2004 re-election of Bush shocked me. I was sure that Americans could see how incompetent Bush was and they’d never let him continue to drive the country into the ground. But they didn’t and he did.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I grew up in Virginia and racism was alive and well by the time I escaped in 1997. I lived in Northern Virginia, the more affluent and liberal part of the state. But even there, racism was only discouraged under the guise of <em>political correctness</em> – people really didn’t behave as if racism was wrong, it was simply not something you talked about. I figured a similar situation exists in other states.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>But America proved me wrong yesterday and I couldn’t be more happy to be wrong. Even Virginia voted for Obama. And more importantly, Obama appears to have been elected not because of his race but because of his character. Martin Luther King’s dream may finally be realized. I might even say that the eight years of George W. Bush had a positive outcome. :)</p>

<p>We kept Havana up late so we could get a photograph of her and Hudson in front of the TV for this historical moment:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3005728831/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3248/3005728831_c1a08395bc.jpg" alt="IMG_2432.JPG" /></a></p>

<p>After a dismal eight years, mostly before they were born, I hope they grow up in a country that is again making progress to the ideal that America was founded upon. If not, I can show them this photo to remind them that as bad as things may seem, positive change can happen.</p>

<p>To my surprise, McCain made a great concession speech. I was sure he’d give a lame speech patting himself on the back for running a great campaign, thanking his supporters and never giving Obama credit. Instead, he correctly accepted personal blame for his defeat (but alas, not their disgraceful lies, smears and for attempting to divide the country and start another culture war) and noted the historical significance of Obama’s victory. His supporters, on the other hand, showed the country one more time how class-less they are by booing both Obama’s and Biden’s names. In contrast, McCain’s name generated cheers when Obama mentioned him in his speech. That’s more proof that America made the correct decision.</p>

<p>My favorite parts from “Obama’s speech”:http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/stateupdates/gGx3Kc:</p>

<p>bq. If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible; who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.</p>

<p>bq. So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves, but each other.  Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it’s that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers – in this country, we rise or fall as one nation; as one people.</p>

<p>bq. And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of our world – our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand.  To those who would tear this world down – we will defeat you.  To those who seek peace and security – we support you.  And to all those who have wondered if America’s beacon still burns as bright – tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from our the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope.</p>

<p>bq. For that is the true genius of America – that America can change.  Our union can be perfected.  And what we have already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Actually, I already voted via mail-in voting a couple weeks ago as well as donated more money than I’ve ever donated to any political campaign. I was originally a Hillary Clinton supporter and I still think she would have made the best President. Obama has different strengths, but I think he’s just as intelligent and rational as Hillary. Hillary is still far more attractive, however.</p>

<p>I’m a fiscal conservative and a social liberal. That means that I agree, in general, with Republicans on the free market, lower taxes and smaller government. The problem I have with Republicans is that I think they like those things because they’re greedy and selfish, but I like them because I think they foster a healthier economy, increases prosperity and benefits society. Democrats agree with Republicans on a free-market, low taxes and small government, they just aren’t as extremist. Republicans believe that the free-market solves <em>all</em> problems, Democrats believe it solves <em>most</em> problems.</p>

<p>Being a “social liberal” means that I believe that everyone has a right to live their own life any way they see fit (as long as they don’t inflict direct harm on someone else, of course) and everyone has a right to the same opportunities. I believe that government can and should guarantee both of these. Democrats believe this, while Republicans tend to want the government to control how other people live, especially if those people have different views then they do, and even restrict rights of some citizens. I also think that Republicans preach anger, fear and hatred while Democrats encourage unity and optimism.</p>

<p>On my fiscal conservative-ness, or economics, Obama understands economics and, more  importantly, surrounded himself with the best economists in the country. McCain used Carly Fiorina (not an economist by any stretch of the imagination) as his economic advisor and, only after much criticism by the smart Republicans, he finally hired a single economist to advise him weeks before the election. And this was years after he admitted several times that he doesn’t understand economics as well as he should – that’s irresponsible. Obama will raise my taxes because I’m in the top 0.1% (poor me!), but I believe his policies will spur economic growth which will increase my income. I’ll pay a higher tax on higher income any day over a lower tax on lower income.</p>

<p>For my social liberal-ness, Obama agrees with me on almost every issue. McCain disagrees with me on almost every issue…</p>

<p>The Iraq War. That’s easy. Obama wants to end the war, the longest war we’ve ever been in. McCain has no interest in ending it and even wants to start more wars – he’s a Cold War guy, he loves to play with tanks and missiles.</p>

<p>Healthcare. Obama has a fair plan that makes sense: make it easier to afford quality healthcare for everyone. McCain has a nonsense plan: end employer-subsidized healthcare and force everyone to find quality healthcare for less than half of what it costs today or go without.</p>

<p>Economy. Obama understands the problems and has meaningful plans to improve it. McCain doesn’t care to understand the problems and just wants to let the free-market run its course and see what happens.</p>

<p>Education. Obama plans to put money into education. In my opinion, there are two things you can’t throw too much money at: education and research. McCain favors vouchers, which is the great economist Milton Friedman’s best ideas but biggest failings – they don’t work, wake up, McCain.</p>

<p>Energy. Obama wants to invest heavily in research for alternative energy. This is the only way to do it. Startups and big corporations simply can’t afford to invest the billions of dollars necessary for the research and the long time horizon this will require. Government spending, like the Space Race of the 1960s, is the only way this will happen. McCain wants to drill for oil in America.</p>

<p>Foreign Policy. Obama is willing to use diplomacy to resolve problems around the world. McCain wants to use tanks and missiles.</p>

<p>If McCain wasn’t on the wrong side of all the issues, he selected Sarah Palin as his Vice President. He picked her solely to appeal to the Jesus Freaks and, inexplicably, to Hillary Clinton supporters (of which I am one). Given his age, he was irresponsible to put someone so unqualified to be President so close to the Presidency – he did it to win the election, America be damned. He showed poor judgment all around on that, his first meaningful decision as a President. His judgment can only get worse from there.</p>

<p>Finally, running the campaign itself shows a stark difference in competence between the two. Obama’s campaign was nearly flawless and incredibly well-organized. McCain’s campaign was bankrupt at one point, he threw almost everyone out (showing he made the wrong decisions), replaced them with just as inept people (the same mistake twice), and made mistake after mistake.</p>

<p>The Economist “explained why Obama  is leading”:http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12511205:</p>

<p>bq. Mr Obama’s critics argued that he was only good at giving “pretty speeches”. But the reason that he is the clear favourite is that he has such a wide range of strengths. He has created the most innovative machine in recent political history. He has produced detailed policy proposals on everything from health insurance to Russia (he has a brain-bank of 200 foreign-policy experts). He has displayed grace under pressure when confronted with everything from Jeremiah Wright’s anti-American rants to the Wall Street meltdown. Mr Obama is a decathlete not a one-trick pony.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>I realize that Joe The Plumber is not named “Joe”, he’s not a plumber and he lied about planning to buy a plumbing business. That aside, it’s amazing how his ignorance about business and taxes has been bandied about by McCain as a legitimate issue. Here’s a portion of “the transcript between him and Obama”:http://www.tampabay.com/news/perspective/article858299.ece:</p>

<p>bq. Joe: I’m getting ready to buy a company that makes about $250,000 … $270-$280,000 a year.</p>

<p>bq. Obama: All right.</p>

<p>bq. Joe: Your new tax plan’s gonna tax me more, isn’t it?</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>bq. Obama: Well, here’s what’s gonna happen. If you’re a small business which you would qualify as, first of all, you’d get a 50 percent tax credit, so you get a cut on taxes for your health care costs. So you would actually get a tax cut on that front. If your revenue is above $250,000, then from $250,000 down, your taxes are gonna stay the same. It is true that for…say, from $250,000 up, from $250,000 to $300,000 or so…</p>

<p>Obama makes a good point that I think is lost on a lot of people. Most people hear that the top tax bracket is 35% and they conclude that they are paying 35% in tax. We have a progressive tax system, you only pay the tax in each bracket for the dollars you make within that bracket, not on all of your dollars. I learned this when I filed my first tax return when I was 15, why do most people still not understand this?</p>

<p>bq. Joe: Well, the reason why I ask you about the American Dream I mean, I work hard. I’m a plumber, I work 10-12 hours a day…</p>

<p>bq. Obama: Absolutely.</p>

<p>bq. Joe: …and I’m, you know, buying this company and I’m gonna continue to work that way. Now, if I buy another truck and adding something else to it and, you know, build the company, you know, I’m getting taxed more and more while fulfilling the American Dream.</p>

<p>Joe, if you buy another truck or anything else for your business, that’s a business expense. You don’t pay taxes on business expenses, you pay taxes on the profit your business earns.</p>

<p>I don’t think this hypothetical plumbing business makes $250K/year in profit. If that were true, I’m in the wrong industry! But let’s assume it’s true. If the plumbing business that you want to buy is generating $250-$280K/year in profit, you’ll be a wealthy man once you buy it, so you’ve accomplished the American Dream. Congratulations! Even if you pay a higher tax rate, so what? You’re rich. You’ll still be rich after you pay taxes.</p>

<p>If you’d prefer to no longer be wealthy and have to pay higher taxes, you have a great option that all wealthy people have: give money away until you’re not wealthy and you’ll pay lower taxes. That is, if you have no understanding of simple math, you should do that.</p>

<p>But the reality is that this hypothetical plumbing business makes $250-280K/year in <em>revenue</em>. You aren’t taxed on revenue, you’re taxed on profit. The profit is likely quite a bit less than $250K, so you’d have no tax increase at all.</p>

<p>It amazes me how the Republican Party has convinced non-wealthy people that they should feel sorry for wealthy people and their higher tax bill. Our schools really need a better math program.</p>
