        <article>
          <p>There’s a class of people who focus on the negative aspects of everything. This is nothing new and I’m sure you know the type… the type of person who, if given free money, would complain that they have to pay taxes; the kind of person you say “Today’s a nice day!” to and they answer “Yes, but tomorrow probably won’t be.” And they always portray themselves as the unlucky lot in society. Life is something that happens to them, something they have no control over. Successful people are “just lucky”. We’ve all met these people and they annoy us (assuming you’re an optimist), but they’re not such a problem because they’re so easy to avoid. Pessimists gravitate towards each other and repel optimists who gravitate towards each other. And each group encourages/discourages itself. So pessimists tend to spiral downward while optimists tend to spiral upward. Optimists tend to create and build, pessimists see the value in creating but think the optimist is going to fail (and rarely resist the opportunity to point that out).</p>

<p>But I’ve recently discovered the “extreme pessimist”. Regular pessimists can at least see that there’s another side, they just convince themselves that they’ll never experience it. Extreme pessimists don’t even know there is anything but negativity. Positives are invisible because they don’t exist in their world view. They never compliment people, they rarely smile, they never enjoy themselves. They just wallow in a pool of negativity that just gets bigger and bigger. They don’t have blinders. They don’t need blinders because they are always looking down. Optimists tend to build and create, extreme pessimists only point out the flaws in the creations.</p>

<p>Sucks to be them!</p>

          <p>Even <a href="http://slate.msn.com">Slate</a>, historically a blatant Microsoft shill, <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2103152/">recommends Firefox</a> over IE. Good going, Slate!</p>

<p>But I have to mention his grossly-understated “because [Microsoft’s] management pushed the bounds of business ethics”. Let’s call a spade a spade: <strong>they’re convicted criminals</strong>. I wonder what colloquial expression Paul Boutin would use summarizing Enron.</p>

          <p>The US Govt <a href="http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B7D91FC13-9FA9-4703-B000-10000DAA78DD%7D&amp;siteid=google&amp;dist=google">recommends against using Internet Explorer</a>. Will people listen? Nope. But when they raise the terror threat warning, people buy duct tape. Go figure.</p>

<p>Use <a href="http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> or <a href="http://mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/">Mozilla</a>. Not only are they more standards-compliant, less buggy, have more capabilities such as pop-up-blocking and tabbed-browsing, and faster than IE, they’re safer.</p>

<p>But I have noticed that IE has dropped from ~92% marketshare on Recipezaar to 85% in the last several months. Maybe one day we can stop working around the bugs in IE.</p>

          <p>The <a href="http://www.eff.org">EFF</a> is <a href="http://www.eff.org/patent/">going to fight</a> to have what they think are 10 most egregious internet patents thrown out. Software patents should be banned completely. As a software developer, I should be an advocate of software patents but the fact is that they do not achieve the goal of patents, namely to advance technology. Patenting a software algorithm is tantamount to patenting the steps to wash your car. Forcing people to pay you to wash their car using your instructions does not help anyone but the patent-holder. And that is <em>not</em> what patents were designed for. There are only a handful of ways to wash your car and if patents are granted to each one, nobody will be washing their car. Software patents do the same thing – they prevent new software from being developed. That leads to stagnation of software. Software patents have the exact opposite effect they intend.</p>

<p>There’s also an unnamed competitor of ours that has begun to file patents on their features on their web site, probably an attempt to increase the value of their company so they can sell it. I can’t wait til they contact us and accuse of violating their patent because they have filed for a patent this year for a feature we had on our site in 2000. When we demonstrate our prior art, they will have to go through a patent review process and may lose their patent and the money they wasted on the effort.</p>
