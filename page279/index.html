          <p>Our ferries are <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/177385_ferrywifi11.html">getting Wi-Fi</a>. Unfortunately, not the Vashon ferry yet. Whenever I see stuff like this, I laugh at all the people who think that the “offline scenario” is so critical. There’s companies and people working on making internet technology work well when you’re not connected. Here’s a prediction: most of us will be connected to the internet in most places, and when we’re not, we don’t care about the internet.</p>

          <p>Watching <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/theoffice/">The Office</a>, there’s a great bit when the IT guy comes to install software on a computer. When he’s done, he tells the computer’s user:</p>

<p>“I’m now going to restart the computer. When it starts again, it will ask you a question with three options: Yes, No and Cancel. Press Cancel, do not press Yes or No.”</p>

<p>Have you ever been asked a question like that? Yes, No, Cancel.</p>

          <p>TiVo is set to announce <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/09/technology/09net.html">a download service</a> so I can download movies directly to my TiVo. No more waiting weeks for the new movies to be available on DVD, I should be able to watch movies the night they’re released on video. Bye bye Netflix.</p>

          <p>This <a href="http://www.seattleweekly.com/features/0422/040602_news_microsoft.php">article</a> sums up my feelings almost exactly. Microsoft is not successful today because people love its products, because most people curse Windows and Office daily. They are successful for other reasons, not the least of which was years of infamous business practices. And eventually (and soon) that will come to an end.</p>

<p>When I left, I was pretty loyal to Microsoft, although the truths that the antitrust trial brought out left a bad taste in my mouth. But since then I’ve also discovered how wonderful OS X is and how useful Linux is. Although neither are perfect (yet), I live the life I dreamed about when I was 12. I like computers again.</p>
