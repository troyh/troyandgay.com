            <p>Browsing some new RSS feeds, I come across one of my favorite columns ever: The Straight Dope. And I find that my understanding of “passive-aggressive” is wrong. Cecil <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/030530.html">says</a> it applies to people who are just lazy. This makes no sense to me. I’ve always thought it meant someone who tries to get their way (acts aggressively) but does so without being overtly aggressive (passive).</p>

<p>Here’s two cases of what I would call “passive-aggressive” behavior that I’ve experienced. What are these called if not passive-aggressive?</p>

<p>1.) Our neighbor once walked up to us and asked “Do you feed your dogs? If you don’t feed them, I’d be happy to continue to feed them for you.”  She discovered that one of our dogs would eat food when offered (have you ever seen a dog say “No thanks, I’m really stuffed”?) and/or ate her cat’s food that was left outside all day.</p>

<p>2.) At a restaurant <a href="http://www.whistler-blackcomb.com/">Whistler</a> in Canada, after two shockingly bad attempts at making a <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/search/getrecipe.zsp?id=8877&amp;path=">Manhattan</a>, the waiter brought the ingredients to our table and asked Gay if she would like to make her own Manhattan.</p>

            <p>It’s 10pm and I’m just getting ready to eat dinner. And watch OLN’s “definining moments” show on the Tour de France with the first interview with Armstrong.</p>

The U.S. is just 227 years old (11 generations of people) and we’ve already forgotten one of the biggest problems  the creation of the U.S. solved. Stunning. Americans really do have a short attention span and absolutely no sense of history.</p>

            <p>We recently had a <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll">troll</a> on <a href="http://recipezaar.com">the site</a>. In classic troll behavior, he posted good threads, but quickly started controversial topics and fanned the flames by posting often and making vague personal attacks. When we privately tried to talk to him about what he’s doing, he basically told us “Too bad, I can say whatever I want and you can’t stop me and if you try, you’re censors! I’ve been doing this for years and am better at this than you are!”. People are weird. So we gave him the customary Warning #1. He then told us what we can do with our “threats” and our web site and that he won’t be back. He lied. Twice he came back. Troll.</p>

<p>When he advocates gay marriage and refutes race-mixing we let it go until the topic devolves into name-calling. Then, of course, we are branded censors, or pro-Gay by the anti-Gay people and anti-Gay by the pro-Gay people, white supremacists and politically-correct. It’s nuts. But nobody sees how nuts this is. And people forget that it’s a recipe web site. We’re here to help people enjoy good food, not debate interracial relationships. But trolls understand that people are quick to get emotional about topics and perspective goes out the window and trolls enjoy watching it. And the emotions run so high we become the target of the attacks if we try to calm people down. It’s the textual equivalent of an angry mob – rational thought has no place. It’s a scary thing to watch, even in text.</p>
