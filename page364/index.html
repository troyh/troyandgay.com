          <p>Ullrich beat Lance in the individual time trial  yesterday by <strong>1 minute 36 seconds</strong>. That’s a very wide margin to put into one of the best time trialists in the world especially for someone who has been out of racing for the last couple years. Ullrich moved up to #2 (Tyler Hamilton moved up to #4) behind Lance just 34 seconds back. The mountains this weekend are going to be very interesting.</p>

          <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/productshotimac2002.jpg" alt="productshotimac2002.jpg" />We added another baby to the household yesterday.  It is so darn cute you can’t help but talk to it and pat it and make it’s little screen move up and down anthropomorphically.  I thought for sure we’d have one of these days after they were first released, but it didn’t make sense then.</p>

          <p>I finished the new Harry Potter the weekend before last in an all Sunday marathon session.  I liked it quite a lot but the 3rd remains my favorite.  I am thoroughly charmed by Harry, and Rowlings ability to rejuvenate young readers.  Remarkably I returned to <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/06/001514.php">The Clinton Wars</a> and will finish it tonight.  I am also now reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735712018/recipezaar-20"><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/dws100.gif" alt="dws100.gif" />Designing with Web Standards</a> online using <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">O’Reilly’s Safari bookshelf</a> (you pay $20/month and can read 5 technical books).  It is a great book on web standards, but it is perfect to read online because he links to so many sites and they are real links online and on paper, well, you have retype them. (click the pic to check it out at Amazon, more comments later).</p>

          <p><a href="http://recipezaar.com">Our database server</a> flipped out for a few minutes last night at 11p.  Nothing like getting ready for bed and thinking you need to be getting ready to hop a ferry and go downtown to reboot a server at midnight.  Granted, living on an island makes anything, esp. late night activities, more complicated, but businesses that never close can be a real drag.</p>
