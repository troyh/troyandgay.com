            <p>I’m irritated that the seven words (or however many there were) are quickly being forgotten.  Please let’s not forget that we were led into this war under suspicious circumstances, we are not accomplishing our goals there, and Americans are dying.  An interesting analysis piece in Slate argues that <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2086636/">we do not have 1/4 of the troops necessary to successfully restore Iraq</a>.</p>

<p><em>“The highest levels of casualties have occurred in the operations with the lowest levels of U.S. troops.” In fact, he adds, “Only when the number of stabilization troops has been low in comparison to the population”such as in Somalia, Afghanistan, and now Iraq”have U.S. forces suffered or inflicted significant casualties.” By contrast, in Germany, Japan, Bosnia, and Kosovowhere troop levels were highAmericans suffered no postwar combat deaths.</em></p>

            <p>It’s fun to build something and release it for the world to try. And tonight I found the <a href="http://www.librarystuff.net/new_archives/000618.html">1st review</a> of <a href="http://mywireservice.com">MyWireService</a>. Pretty good. Yes, we do need more feeds. But I always love when people notice performance, cuz it’s hard to do (and we haven’t really concentrated on performance much yet).</p>

          </h3>
            <p>We’ve made some pretty significant enhancements to the <a href="http://www.mywireservice.com">MyWireService beta</a>.  We now support creating your new newspaper sections, saved clippings are more accessible, and we’ve made it easier to get to past news, and a lot more, including working around a dumb CSS redraw bug in IE that made it almost impossible to read your news.  Did I mention that we added The Globe &amp; Mail for Bergy and we’re still looking for more Canadian news sources? ;-)  We actually feel good enough to start telling people about it.  So if you have a news junkie or weblogging friend, tell them about it.</p>

            <p>Criminey, only the Seattle Times would write <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/08/001611.php#001611">an article on an overpriced eBay auction item</a>. Worst newspaper ever. But it reminds me our friend who turned down $50,000 from someone who wanted his <a href="http://flee.com">flee.com</a> domain.</p>

            <p><a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2001374137_btdownload04.html">Some idiot thinks that In2gr8.net is a better name than Fine.com?</a> AND he thinks he can sell Fine.com for $69,000 on ebay?  We just went through this domain name/company name search for <a href="http://www.mywireservice.com">MyWireService</a>, so I know the hardships of trying to find a spellable, pronouncable name that someone isn’t already squatting on, but In2gr8.net Isnt2gr8.anything.  I almost peed my pants laughing when we called one of these squatters asking if they’d like to sell a domain we were interested in for $100 + whatever they’d paid for it so far.  “That is orders of magnitude below what we’d consider.”  I tried not to LOL through my “good luck.”  Maybe it makes me a socialist, but I think patents and domains should not get protection unless you actually make the thing you are patenting or use the domain for something.</p>
