          <p>Got up early, went for a nice bike ride and then worked for a few hours. Then we had to head into Seattle to go to Bellevue to the Apple store and pick up an <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">iMac</a>. A friend bought it 1.5 years ago and it died (apparently due to a power surge one night) and it cost him $500 to fix it. So he said I could have it if I paid for the repair. Duh! That’s half-off even a used one and this one just got a brand new motherboard! He even saved the box and left the protective stickers on it.</p>

<p>We also stopped at his office. This was the first time I’ve been back to Microsoft since I left in ‘99. Microsoft is a weird place – everything looks <em>exactly</em> the same everywhere you go. The doors in all the buildings are identical, the offices, the desks, the blinds, etc. The lobbies look slightly different and there’s different artwork on the walls, but it’s so sterile and, well, bland. I felt like I never left yet I’d never been in this building before. I wonder if there’s subliminal sounds piped through the buildings (“you are happy… you like it here…. you are the smartest… you are changing the world….”). It felt better to get back in our dirty car. <img src="/img/smile.gif" alt="" /></p>

He looks like our garbage man who is also named Wayne.  UPDATED: tv news confirms this is our garbage man.  Unfortunately he was a good garbage man.</p>

          <p><a href="http://letour.fr/"><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/letour2003.gif" alt="letour2003.gif" /></a> Wow, a surprisingly interesting day… during the course of the race, Lance lost the lead and regained it. And then an ONCE cyclist in contention attacked on the final climb of the stage, Lance and Beloki, his biggest rival, chased and just 4km from the finish <a href="http://velonews.com/tour2003/details/articles/4520.0.html">Beloki crashed</a> coming fast around a curve in a clearly painful slam into the pavement. Lance also slid on the curve, barely managed to get around him and off the road and then had to ride across a field of hay, hop off his bike, jump over a ditch and get back on the road and on his bike!</p>

<p>Here’s how it unfolded <a href="http://www.velonews.com/live/main/67.html">live on VeloNews</a>:</p>

<p>`
4:48 p.m. Beloki has crashed!
Armstrong has been forced off the road!
Beloki is hurt.</p>

<p>4:49 p.m. Wow…
Armstrong pulled off an amazing feat of bike handling. He rode across the dirt on a hairpin turn.
Beloki, however, is probably out of the Tour. He is hurt.</p>

<p>4:51 p.m. Vinokourov is on his way to the win.
Folks, that Armstrong move is one you are bound to see on replay films for years. He found himself running across the dirt like a ‘cross rider.
Beloki, however, is still on the side of the road.
`</p>

<p>It’s too bad a real contender like Beloki had to end his Tour this way, but it all but cinches it for Lance. Ullrich is still there but he has been unable to keep up with Lance on any of the climbs. And another American, Tyler Hamilton, who is riding with a broken collarbone (!) after a crash in Stage 1, may have a shot at 2nd or 3rd in Paris!</p>

He barely increased his lead over Beloki but did increase his lead over Ullrich. And Simoni lost almost 13 minutes!</p>
