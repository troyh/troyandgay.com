            <p><a href="http://recipezaar.com">Recipezaar</a> is looking for a self-starting, well-organized software developer with 3+ years of experience in software development, specifically AJAX technologies (DHTML, XML, Javascript) in a LAMP environment.</p>

<p>If you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>enjoying building and debugging software that millions of people use and love</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>are willing to throw out code you wrote because you realized you did it wrong</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>think Unix jokes are funny</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>like working independently, from the comfort of your own home</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cringe at the thought of working at a large company that requires four meetings to decide anything</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>believe cooking is both technology and art</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>know the significance of the number 42</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enjoy eating…</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>…then this job might be for you.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong></p>

<p>We’d like someone with a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science, 2+ years experience with PHP and SQL (preferably MySQL), Ajax technologies (DHTML, XML/XSL, Javascript) and an interest in hardware and networking. You don’t have to be an expert on Apache, but should be willing to become knowledgeable about it. If you don’t know what Apache is, forget it. If you know C, you probably understand what happens behind the higher-level scripting languages of the web. That’s important. If you know C++, you understand OO principles. If you love C++, you’ll fit in.</p>

<p>Recipezaar is a small, dynamic company and requires people who can work independently and manage themselves and their workload efficiently. Small companies require you to wear many hats and be able to adapt quickly to changes and be able to solve problems quickly, and Recipezaar is no different. Being a great chef is not a requirement, but having an interest in helping others to be is. An interest in food and food preparation will make the job more fun.</p>

<p>We are a small distributed company (and we plan to stay that way) focused on building the most powerful web application for cooking and eating and sharing. Recipezaar is profitable and growing at a rapid rate. We’re not yet #1 in our market, so if you’re the type who likes to work hard to become #1, Recipezaar wants to talk to you.</p>

<p>To apply, send link to your online resume or text version in email (NO ATTACHMENTS, except PDF) to <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#106;&#111;&#098;&#115;&#064;&#114;&#101;&#099;&#105;&#112;&#101;&#122;&#097;&#097;&#114;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">&#106;&#111;&#098;&#115;&#064;&#114;&#101;&#099;&#105;&#112;&#101;&#122;&#097;&#097;&#114;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;</a>.</p>

            <p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/41/84540846_8ff303bb4f_m.jpg" alt="Gay @ Toby's" />We took the dogs and drove our new car up the Washington peninsula to Whidbey Island for lunch at <a href="http://www.pioneernet.net/tobys/">Toby’s in Coupeville</a>. Toby’s has great mussels, being located right on Penn Cove, where the world famous Penn Cove mussels come from. A short stop in Langley for a coffee and then we headed home, through Seattle.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/41/84551991_d447df0ff8_m.jpg" alt="Illy &amp; Ouzo" />The Jeep has a GPS navigation system in it, which is surprisingly well-designed, accurate and easy-to-use. But it really paid for itself on the way home when we had to get off the highway for gas. The car’s computer was registering zero miles to empty and wouldn’t ya know it, the highway exit we chose had a power outage, so none of the three gas stations there were open to sell gas. Pre-GPS, we’d have had to get out and walk around in the rain looking for a gas station to conserve gas, buy a gas can, fill it and walk back to the car. But thanks to the GPS, we could browse around the area on the computer to find another gas station. We could even get their phone number to call them before risking the drive and our precious little gas. We found one 0.8 miles away, close enough to drive. We filled up and were on our way home, glad for the technology and that we were dry.</p>

            <p>We’re finally replacing our 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee with a 2006 Jeep Commander. It’s stupid to buy a new car, but we couldn’t resist or wait another year for a used one because we liked the Commander so much. It’s one of those cars you either love or hate; we love the boxy old-style Jeep look.</p>

<p>We picked it up last week after ordering it back in November. So far, we <em>love</em> it. It’s amazing how far the car industry has come in the last decade in general comfort, road noise, and gadgetry. Jeep fixed every annoyance I had with the Grand Cherokee and added stuff that I wished the Grand Cherokee had. Unfortunately, it gets worse gas mileage than the Grand Cherokee, but we only drive 6,000 miles/year so we shouldn’t notice it much.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>2005 started bleakly for me. My country had just elected the most incompetent, incoherent, uncaring, destructive President in its history without even knowing it. Fortunately, 2005 ends with the half of the country that voted for him realizing that they made a mistake. But I completely checked-out of politics this year, which ultimately, I think was a great thing for me. So on to something I still care about: my life….</p>

<p>In January, we moved into our new office and we still love it. Good thing, cuz we spend the majority of our lives in it. Along with it, we got into Feng Shui, which is really just Chinese for “good design”, and made a pledge this year to “unclutter” our lives, physically and mentally. It worked. Karate refers to this as “mind like water”, meaning that your mind should respond to information the  way still water responds to a rock thrown into it – the water always reacts proportional to the size of the rock, never over-reacting nor under-reacting.</p>

<p>We went to <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=3066">Vancouver</a> for a mini-vacation for Gay’s 35th birthday. A couple months later, Gay <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=3098">found out</a> the real reason she’s named “Gay”. And Gay <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=3091">ran her first full marathon</a> in San Diego in June.</p>

<p>We spent almost the entire month of <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=3101">July in France</a> partially following the Tour de France and fully enjoying the wine and food. I even <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=3103">documented</a> half the trip. I love France, not since Greece have I found people who just enjoy life. (Maybe that’s why they hate war?)</p>

<p>We celebrated our first wedding anniversary and <em>we’re still married</em>! We spent a few days in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho for <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=3134">Gay’s brother’s wedding</a>.</p>

<p>Our dogs, Illy and Ouzo, both had surgeries this year. Ouzo finally <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=3133">had his duclaws removed</a>, which were causing him more and more trouble, and Illy had <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=3147">her second knee surgery</a> after injuring it (it was on a slow decline) and unable to walk without limping. Illy’s still recovering, but looking great.</p>

<p>I celebrated by 36th birthday in November, heading fast to 40. The holidays have been relaxing for the first time in six or seven years. No travel, no commitments. Not getting any younger and feeling like the last few years have left little time to stop and smell the roses, at the beginning of the year I secretly planned to wind down at Thanksgiving and step back and evaluate our life, personally and professionally to prepare for 2006. I actually got to do that and I’m grateful for it. I think we’re both re-energized and eager for next year.</p>

<p>On the business front, Recipezaar has done better than even our optimistic expectations. We had a little setback in the summer by hiring a really bad design firm to help us redesign the site and our “identity” (logo and branding, to regular people) that we had hoped to launch before the holidays this year. But we got back on track by finding far better people to help us and we’ve already got a great new logo that we love. The site has continued to grow and grow month after month to the point we’re now ranked as the #4 or #5 site in our market, depending on whose numbers you believe.</p>

<p>We realize this blog has been pretty stale recently, but with all that happened at the end of the year, keeping it up-to-date was low on the priority list. Don’t expect that to change in 2006, though, we’ve got a busy plan for the year. If you want to know what’s going on with us, just ask. Or better yet, come visit. :)</p>
