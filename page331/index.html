          <p><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/archives/004490.html">Kos</a> does the math, and there was no record turnout in the Callyforkneeia election.  Different segments voted, but not more people.  The election was fair (2% more people voted for Arnold than voted Davis into office to begin with), but don’t get your hopes up that democracy is more alive or something.  This has me a little bummed, because the only hopeful analysis we’d heard, argued that it is a sign that everyone is dissatisfied with the current administration.

          <p><a href="http://www.perseus.com/blogsurvey/">Interesting weblogs survey</a> finds that 66% of all blogs have not be updated in the past 2 months; in fact, 25% were just tire-kickers (abandoned on the day they began). Not surprisingly, 92% of bloggers are under the age of 30, but 50% are under 19! “Active blogs were updated on average every 14 days.  Only 106,579 of the hosted blogs were updated on average at least once a week.  Fewer than 50,000 were updated daily.”  In other words, what you <em>see</em> of the blogging world (high frequency posting from experts) is very different from reality of the blogging world right now.</p>
