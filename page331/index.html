              <p>A few days ago, <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/10/001767.php">I emailed Steve Ballmer</a> reporting a problem with Windows XP. I actually did get a reply from him the very next day:</p>

<p><code>
We are working diligently on that  did we give you an opportunity to
report the error to us in the error message   did you   thanks so much
for your support
</code></p>

<p>Surprising that the CEO of a large corporation, who is obviously too busy to even use punctuation, actually replied to his email from just some dork. He even had some tech support guy contact me (if you work at Microsoft, when steveb talks, you’d better listen!). And he’s been pretty vigilant, sending me an email every couple days to get more info from me. Of course, my Windows kernel panics often at random times (like everyone’s PC) so it’s pretty pointless, but I commend them on their attempts to resolve it.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m too cynical about the company, but I think the fact that I called him on his claim is the reason Steve Ballmer replied. And I think he missed the original point of my message – admitting bugs is not taking responsibility, actually fixing it and giving your customers the fix for free is taking responsibility. And let’s be honest, anyone who has ever called Microsoft’s tech support is left on hold for hours and then you have to actually pay for the support you get. So, if you ever have trouble with Windows (and I’m sure you do), email steveb@microsoft.com. It’s about the only way you’ll get any response from Microsoft.</p>

              <p>After we realized that <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/10/001779.php#001779">Netflix sent us the wrong DVD</a>, I went to their web site and reported it (they have a way to do that) and I even checked the box on the white sleeve that says that the wrong DVD was sent and mailed it back.</p>

<p>Then I get an email message from them telling me that <em>I</em> mistakenly sent <em>them</em> the wrong DVD in the sleeve! I did both things they ask us to do, and they still get it wrong. There’s no way to telephone them, so I submitted a customer service form on their site explaining it. I then get another email today telling me that they understand what happened and that I should send the movie back as soon as possible. I don’t know how to explain something so simple to them.</p>

<p>I also find it odd that they don’t even bother to make it up to me. Sending me the wrong DVD is their fault. You’d think they’d credit my account 50¢ or do something nice since they screwed up. And they don’t even add the movie I missed automatically to my queue, so when I sent the DVD back, I’d get the right movie again. Nope, I have to add it myself and the next 3 movies on my queue were immediately sent out instead of the one that I actually had higher in my queue.</p>

But what’s worse is that now we discover that they made $1.5 million from people who fell for it! There are some really really really gullible people in the world.</p>
