          <p>Gay <a href="/archives/2003/10/001732.php#001732">has an interesting theory</a> to why people ask us if it’s hard for us to “go to work”. I never thought about it, but I bet that’s right… many people aren’t happy in their jobs so if they worked at home away from the eyes of managers and coworkers, they assume they’d work less rather than more. People have the same initial belief about telecommuters. But if you like what you do, you tend to do it more rather than less.</p>

<p>My typical routine in my favorite “traditional” job (1993-1997): wake up, bike to work, coffee/email/news, work, lunch, work, bike home, dinner, tv/movie, bed.</p>

<p>My typical routine in my least favorite job (1997-1999): wake up, drive to work/coffee, meetings, lunch, meetings, little work, meetings, little work, dinner, drive home, tv/movie/dreading the next day, bed.</p>

<p>My typical routine today (1999-present): wake up, bike ride, coffee/email/news, work, lunch, work, dinner, work, tv/movie, bed.</p>

<p>Life is good again.</p>

<p>Reading the Inc. article reminded me of another thing… there’s lots of talk about balancing work &amp; life these days and the article is full of that talk. When I was at Microsoft, there was a big HR initiative called “Work/Life” (Microsoft is always clever with their names) that was intended to teach employees to gain that balance. Microsoft employees at the time were encouraged to work very long hours to show their commitment to the company. So the Work/Life program seemed to be work against that so I figured it was an idea spawned by some “HR guru” they hired at some point or there was a lawsuit from ex-employees for under-compensation or something. But at the company meeting that year, Ballmer himself had to talk about the Work/Life program. Ballmer is famous for being <a href="http://www.ntk.net/ballmer/mirrors.html">over-excited</a> about everything, shouting at the top of his lungs, <a href="http://www.stenstad.net/storage/ballmer_dance.mpg">running around on stage</a> like he’s about to have a heart attack. I liked that, actually, especially from an exec at a geeky company and the crowd loved it. But when he talked about Work/Life, he couldn’t have been less enthused about encouraging employees to have a balance of work and life; it was like he was delivering a eulogy at a funeral. Needless to say, the Work/Life program had a short life. I wonder what it’s like there today.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20031001/thegoodlife1.html">Inc. Magazine asks a few entrepreneurs what the good life means to them</a>.  (Mostly this magazine is worthless, but I’m drawn in by <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2002/12/001144.php#1144">real people’s stories like this</a>.) Everyday at lunch on our back porch followed by a little walk for our dogs, we feel so lucky to have our good life.  For me, I think the good life is made by doing something you feel passion for combined with the flexibility provided by working for yourself or in a small company.  When people hear we work at home or for ourselves, they always ask if it is difficult to “go to work” each morning, when the opposite is the real difficulty – we can’t stop working, evenings, weekends, etc.  (Perhaps their own dissatisfaction is projected…)  The next mistake they make after we explain this is to ask if it is difficult to then find a balance between work and home.  Sure family and friends are more important than our business, but in reality our business is our life too, and we’re proud of it.  As a result, “balance” is not necessarily the right word – you don’t “prioritize” one child over another.  As one woman says in this article “I have one life, and it must come together.”</p>

These friends seem to be on a US tour: Seattle &gt; New York &gt; Seattle &gt; San Francisco &gt; Seattle …and they plan on moving back to SF after Mike completes his year assisting <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=9th+circuit+judge+%22richard+tallman%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">9th circuit appellate Judge Richard Tallman</a>.  Mike used to (unfavorably) cover the Microsoft beat for <a href="http://www.seattleweekly.org">The Seattle Weekly</a> and is now characterized as the Weekly’s “most nakedly ambitious writer ever” by his ex-editor in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312304218/recipezaar-20">Seattle and the Demons of Ambition</a> – I’m as provincial as the next Seattlite, but it is an oxymoronic title…</p>

          <p>I got my <a href="http://www.bluetooth.com/">Bluetooth</a> <a href="http://www.dlink.com/products/?model=DBT-120">adapter</a> to connect my computer to my cell phone today. It works. It’s funny…. the instruction manual had seven pages of instructions for installing it on a Windows computer, lots of diagrams and lots of “Click Next” and “Click Yes” guiding you through installing software, giving Windows the path to the new drivers for the device, etc.</p>

<p>The instructions for the Macintosh was 1 sentence that said: “Simply insert the D-Link DBT-120 Bluetooth USB Adapter into an available USB port on your Macintosh OS X v10.2 and the installation will proceed automatically”. I remember when Microsoft’s marketing slogan was “Microsoft: Making It Easier”; not “easy”, but “easier”.</p>
