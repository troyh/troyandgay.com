          <p>Now that <a href="/archives/2003/09/001696.php#001696">we’re engaged</a>, the planning begins: a date, catering, invitations, etc. It’ll be sometime next summer and we will probably have it at our house. Other than that, nothing yet. But we’ve already found <a href="http://citizenrob.blogspot.com/">a Seattle printer</a> who won’t be printing our invitations.</p>

          <p>My dad came home from the hospital today and we talked to him on the phone (and also gave them <a href="/archives/2003/09/001696.php#001696">the big news</a>). He sounded very alert, moreso than before I think. I don’t know if that’s because of the operation, but he does say that he has an easier time walking already (the biggest symptom of hydrocephalus is trouble walking) and he says that his head is “more clear”. He’s still sore from the operation and can’t do anything strenuous for 30 days but it’s all very encouraging. This week should be very interesting, as the first week tends to show great improvement after the shunt surgery.</p>

<p>My sister flew from Virginia to Florida this morning to spend the week with them and help out.</p>

<p>…in front of a very-well lit Korean deli and a gaggle of crackheads.  Five years ago it was a more romantic street and the spot of our first kiss after a <a href="http://www.brainwashed.com/bedhead/info.html">Bedhead</a> concert at the <a href="http://www.thecrocodile.com/">Crocodile Cafe</a>.  We tried to celebrate with dinner at the <a href="http://www.queencitygrill.citysearch.com/">Queen City Grill</a>, the same place we’d had dinner that night five years before – and had never been back to since; I’d been so grumpy about it the first time – but they were too full so we went to the always amazing <a href="http://www.tomdouglas.com/dahlia/index.html">Dahlia Lounge</a>, toasting with a bottle of one of our favorite cabernets, <a href="http://www.silveroak.com/">Silver Oak</a>.</p>

          <p>My Aunt Lillian just got on the internet for the first time (AOL, of course).  Imagine trying to explain the internet to someone who has simply never been on it before – the possibilities are so great, and so difficult to explain.  “If it is blue and underlined you can click it and go someplace” is suddenly a really good tip! We had our first email yesterday and I think I really startled her with our first instant message today.</p>

          <p>Matt Hartley <a href="http://rss.lockergnome.com/archives/opinion/007108.phtml">recommends</a> using <a href="http://mywireservice.com">MyWireService</a> for newbies. He’s right and he clearly understands the flaws in RSS.</p>

<p>Telling the average person who reads news they need “an RSS aggregator” is like telling a television viewer they need “a radio wave tuner and cathode ray tube”. This is what technologists always fail to grasp. Worse, they call RSS a “simple” technology. Yes, it’s simple to someone who understands HTTP and HTML, but it’s not simple to most people.</p>

<p>RSS, like XML (because it is XML), is useful to programmers only. Software must step up several levels to make it approachable to real people and that’s where MyWireService comes in.</p>
