She’s been training for it all year long, running 5-10 miles a day during the week and 20-25 mile runs on weekends.

The exciting news for us is that we met <a href="http://www.trainright.com/">Chris Carmichael</a>, Lance Armstrong’s trainer, after a little Q&amp;A thing he did at the expo and we got a photo of Gay with him. It was a surprise that he’d be here, so that was our excitement for the afternoon.</p>

<p>Then off to a carb-loading dinner at <a href="http://www.demedici.signonsandiego.com/">De Medici</a> with Megan, Jon and Megan’s parents (who also flew in to watch the marathon) Saturday night.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15373293@N00/18248320/"><img src="http://photos13.flickr.com/18248320_ac322a60d3_m.jpg" alt="Pre-Marathon" /></a>We woke up at 5:30am Sunday morning, planning to be picked up by Megan’s parents in their rental car to take us to the start line, but they found out that they couldn’t get to the hotel thanks to the streets being blocked off for the marathon. Fortunately, another runner at our hotel scheduled a hotel car to take him to the start, so we got a ride with him and were lucky enough to be dropped off only two blocks from the start. Megan and Jon, on the other hand, had to park on the other side of the <a href="http://www.sandiegozoo.org/">San Diego Zoo</a> and hike to the start line.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15373293@N00/18248398/"><img src="http://photos13.flickr.com/18248398_347c4244a0_m.jpg" alt="Gay &amp; Megan" /></a>At 6:30am the run started and Gay and Megan crossed the start line at 6:41am. Jon, Megan’s parents and I then walked from the start to mile 8 to  see them. Here’s the mile 8 station, the only place we could manage  to see them on the race route since it’s so difficult to drive and  park around the city because all the roads are blocked off. Me and  Megan’s dad handed out water cups to the runners until Gay &amp; Megan   reached this point. The day was overcast throughout the race which  kept it much cooler than a sunny day. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/15373293@N00/18248433/"><img src="http://photos13.flickr.com/18248433_2a5e161133_m.jpg" alt="Gay &amp; Megan walking to start" /></a></p>

<p>We then walked back to the start line, through the park, by the San  Diego Zoo to the car that Megan’s parents’ rental car. We stopped at a  Starbucks for  coffee and then headed to the finish line. This took  us a good hour and then we had to park a half a mile away from the  parking lot since it was full. We then took a shuttle through the  Marine base to the finish line about an hour before they would  finish. You could sign up to receive notifications on your cell phone  as they crossed several points through the race (they wore little  chips on their shoes that tracked them electronically). This was very  handy so we could tell where they were and when they would reach each point.</p>

Michelob Ultra… talk about the dumbest beer to serve at the end of a marathon: a beer with low carbs. I wonder if the hot dogs they were selling were protein-free. By noon, we were back at their apartment having beer and ordering pizza. Megan’s parents left for their evening flight back home and we all went back to our hotel to clean up, change and then to the bar for a couple drinks. After a quick stop at <a href="http://www.yardhouse.com/location.asp?id=8">The Yardhouse</a> (just because they have <a href="http://fullers.co.uk/">Fuller’s</a> ESB on tap) we had dinner at a Mexican restaurant and then back home.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>A Seattle coffee shop <a href="http://wifinetnews.com/archives/005325.html">cut off their free Wi-Fi on weekends only</a> last week because customers sat there all day with their laptops. Of course, some customers didn’t like the decision:</p>

<blockquote>One poster referred to Victrola management as "Wi-Fi Nazis"; another accused Victrola of "trying to increase turnover to get more proﬁt per table"-the implication being, of course, that businesses should have other interests than proﬁt in mind. "People have talked about how we're horrible capitalist pigs," an exasperated Strongin says. "They think we're sitting in our Victrola mansion laughing about all the extra cash we're making."</blockquote>

<p>I know how they feel. :)  And I bet there were more than a few people with the old “I paid $1.29 for my coffee, you OWE me free Wi-Fi!” completely ignoring the fact that they got a coffee for that $1.29. As usual, those who take the proper perspective realize the truth:</p>

<blockquote>Meanwhile, supportive customers, who outnumbered opponents on the blogs by at least two to one, have noted that businesses like Victrola have every right to expect customers to pay their way. Caffe Ladro, down the street, offers free wi-ﬁ, but only for one hour; Starbucks, the only other coffee shop on that stretch of 15th Avenue, charges $29.95 a month.</blockquote>

          </h3>
            <p>Google’s <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code</a> offers students $4,500 to work on open source projects this summer. Very cool. That’s $1,500 for each of three months of the summer, or $9.38/hr. When I was in college, I worked as a night security guard in an office building (which requires doing absolutely nothing, so I got paid to do homework) and was paid $9/hr. Granted, that was 1990 dollars, but if I could have been paid to work on Apache, Mono, Subversion, Nmap, etc., wow.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>I spent my Memorial Day weekend building my first Tiger Dashboard widget. It’s a monitor for <a href="http://ganglia.info">Ganglia</a>, which is what we use to monitor our server clusters. I wanted this ever since I heard about <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/">Dashboard</a> and now I have it. No more refreshing a web page to see the quick status of all the servers.</p>

<p>It should work with anyone’s Ganglia setup, if you install <a href="http://troyandgay.com/public/ganglia.phps">the PHP script</a> that feeds it the XML data it needs and <a href="http://troyandgay.com/public/Ganglia.wdgt.zip">download the widget</a>. Put the PHP script somewhere on your server. You’ll have to modify the code right now to set the URL to that PHP script. Later, I’ll make it configurable from the widget itself (or you can). Consider it GPL’d, so please feel free to improve it but let me know so I can have the improvements too. :)</p>

<p>TODO list:
1. Make the flipside of the widget to set configurable options.
2. Display a history graph like the Apple-supplied stocks widget.
3. Make the clusters clickable to go to the standard Ganglia web page for the cluster
4. Make it prettier.</p>

            <p><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/tips_for_getting_good_customer_support.php">37signals deals with the same customer support issues we do</a>. People starting their questions with threats and treating us as if we’re monsters and not people are very common things we see too. It seems everyone wants a company to behave like a person, but the second you do, BAM!, they start swinging. Not everyone, of course, or even most, but definitely many. I now have a much better understanding of why companies act like robots instead of people – it’s the only way to survive mentally.</p>
