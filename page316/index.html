            <p>My parents live in Ocala, Florida and they have a new neighbor: <a href="http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031102/NEWS/311021090/1010/REALESTATE">John Travolta</a> and a house with parking for <em>two</em> jets. How did John Travolta get so rich? From what I can tell, he’s had two hit movies in his career. Don’t you need billions to own jets?</p>

            <p>I rode my “long” ride three times this week. One of my New Year’s Resolutions from last year was to ride half my rides on the long route, so I think I’m going to meet that resolution this year. And good thing I got a lot of riding in this week, because I just got this weather alert: A SERIES OF INCREASINGLY STRONG WEATHER SYSTEMS WILL CROSS WESTERN  WASHINGTON TONIGHT THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK.</p>

C<em>CKSUCKING THIEF AND MOTHERF</em>CKING BASTARD. C<em>CKSUCKING THIEF AND MOTHERF</em>CKING BASTARD. C<em>CKSUCKING THIEF AND MOTHERF</em>CKING BASTARD.”
This last sentence repeats for several pages in the selected bright red 32 point type(without any asterisks).  They are complaining because we’ve had to remove their account for abusive behavior towards other members, so their recipes now appear as posted by “Recipezaar” instead of their name.  What is really adorable about the note is that they became abusive because another member pointed out that a recipe this person had posted originally appeared on another website.  Awww, so sweet.</p>
