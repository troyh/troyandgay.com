          <p>I ran the farthest I’ve ever run on Tuesday and promptly proceeded to get sick.  Friday night was the worst with the coughing and the not sleeping.  I’ve lost my voice and can’t swallow well. I coughed so hard, I threw up in the shower today, which is very, very weird.  I hate being sick most for the fact that it has cut into my training, and yesterday that I spent napping would have been great for a Fall run.  Troy has been a good nurse and I feel I am finally coming out of it.</p>

          <p>Well, Troy seems disappointed that we don’t argue enough in this blog, <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/11/001810.php#001810">this post</a> certainly worked: <em>Not only did Gay completely miss the point, she also forgot the point and refuses to get the point. Women!</em></p>

<p>Frankly, we rarely disagree on issues so it is difficult to present other perspectives on cue, and together I think we present a more rounded picture of our life and interests than each of us would individually.  More than anything he seems disappointed that I post less frequently than he does.  To me it is personal, and getting into a personal space for posting is rare.  Perhaps, we never discussed what the point of this blog is because I think we might have different visions.</p>

<p>There. We disagree.</p>

          <p>Gay found <a href="http://www.sauria.com/~jjl/blog/archives/000204.html">this</a> that mentions this site. The (not so) funny thing is that the idea behind TroyAndGay.com was that we’d both write about the same things so you’d get both our perspectives on things. But nope, Gay won’t write about anything that I’ve written about and if I mention something she also mentioned she gets angry.</p>

          <p>I love the Fall. I’m sitting on the back patio surrounded by fallen leaves and yellow trees, wearing a very warm wool sweater, a cup of tea (tea from our friend who lives in Sri Lanka) and doing <a href="http://ee-staff.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/">geeky stuff</a> on the laptop. The dogs love to sit outside too, in the flower beds ruining the plants. Gay’s inside still sick.</p>

<p>Update: back inside. Crikey, it’s cold out.</p>

          <p>The <a href="http://steelers.com">Steelers</a> actually won a game! They beat the Cardinals, 28-15, for the first win in 5 games.</p>
