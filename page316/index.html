              <p><a href="http://www.moveon.org">MoveOn.org</a> (an organization founded by average folks in response to frustration with Bill Clinton’s impeachment hearings, the lack of congressional resolution, and a desire to get the country focused on real problems) sponsored an amateur video contest:  Make a thirty second spot that best explains what the president’s policies are really all about, not just those lame voice over commercials you usually see in political campaigns.  It is a brilliant idea, and the <a href="http://www.bushin30seconds.org/index.html">Bush in 30 seconds</a> winner is great.  They are now raising money to get the spot played on CNN during the State of the Union address coverage and during the Superbowl – though so far <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/sports/2357653">CBS says the ad doesn’t pass their Standards and Practices committee</a>, huh?!  They allow White House ads, ads against smoking, other political ads.  PLEASE!</p>

<p>I believe this kind of free political expression is precisely what our country is founded on.  <a href="http://www.moveonvoterfund.org/donate/creditcard.html">We gave to the cause, and encourage you to do so too</a>, if you believe in freedom of speech and would like to see a political ad truly made by the people instead of boring ads made by big dumb political action committees or parties.</p>

              <p>I talked about <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/11/001834.php">dumb cooking/computer ideas</a> in November. Now, here’s <a href="http://tmio.com/">a net-enabled refrigerator/oven</a>. I guess this is geared towards people who only eat casseroles. And casserole-eaters who have so much free time in the morning to prepare their casserole for the evening but just can’t spare 40 minutes in the evening after work to turn the oven on and to wait for it to cook. Tech companies just don’t understand cooking, why do we get so many dumb ideas and why do VCs fund them?!</p>

              <p>After 35 hours, our power was finally restored at 10:15am this morning. Why is electricity so poorly-maintained? Because it’s a monopoly. Monopolies have no incentive to improve their service, in fact, they are incented to not improve it because improving it costs money that cannot be recouped. And of course, since it’s a monopoly, we have no choice but to continue paying any fees they want to charge us regardless of the quality of the service.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T had a federally-granted monopoly on telephone service in the US for many years but the government finally broke it up (thanks to lawyers on behalf of MCI). We need lawyers to sue to break up power companies and create competition in this critical industry. The service will be more reliable and costs will be lower.</p>

              <p>Nothing to do but read news while the power is out and my laptop battery still has power, and I find that <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/nm/nfl_gibbs_dc">Joe Gibbs is returning to coach the Redskins</a> – I care because I grew up (and I use the term “grew up” loosely) in the Washington DC area. Has there ever been another coach who coached after being inducted into the Hall of Fame?</p>
