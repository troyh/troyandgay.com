          <p>We stopped for lunch outside Portland in Gresham. We picked up sandwiches from Subway and looked for a park where the kids could play after eating. We and another driver coming the opposite direction at an intersection  avoided being hit by an idiot who flew through a red light seemingly unaware that they almost slammed into 2 cars.</p>

<p>After lunch and play time at a windy park, we drove through Mt. Hood national park, by Mt. Hood and down to Bend. We checked into the hotel, The Oxford Hotel: great location, a big room, nice gym with a view and a unhurried noon check-out time. We had dinner at the original Deschutes brewpub just around the corner. The kids barely napped in the car so they went to sleep easily.</p>

<p>Bend is a sunny cute little town surrounded by snow-covered mountains. I could stay here another day or two.</p>

<p>We have a short drive today to Klamath Falls so we’re going to stop by the Deschutes Brewery before we leave Bend and get some shirts or something.</p>

          <p>On our way to Bend, Oregon…</p>

<p>After washing and cleaning the Jeep, I tried to start it to put in the garage and it wouldn’t start. It sounds like the starter is bad. <a href="http://www.jeepcommander.com/forums/showthread.php?t=5647">Googling</a> seems to show that this is a common problem with Commanders. So we took the Lexus instead and will hope that there’s no snow in Tahoe.</p>

          <p>We took Hudson to his pediatrician to get <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/03/11/hudsons-first-stitches/">his stitches</a> removed. Poor guy, we had to hold him down and still so she could remove them and he got scared of the tweezers and scissors coming toward his eye. He kept yelling “Dop! Dop!” (“Stop! Stop!” in Hudson-speak) which is not fun to hear for a parent. He quickly forgot about it after it was done and we went to lunch after where he had fun playing with the salt and pepper shakers. The cut looks good so far. Hopefully it won’t have much scarring, if any.</p>

          <p>Last night before dinner Gay heard Hudson crying and found him laying on the floor next to the living room steps. He had a cut above his left eye. We put Neosporin and a Band-Aid on it and thought he’d be okay. He stopped crying, at least.</p>

<p>Gay was still worried about it since it was on his face and could end up as a scar. I tried to convince her that he’d be fine and we went to bed. At 12:30am, Havana was woken up by the wind and rain on her window and came into our room. I discovered that Gay wasn’t there and didn’t find her in Hudson’s room either. I checked my phone and found a text message from Gay. At midnight, she decided to take Hudson to the hospital in Seattle. Havana slept with me in our bed and Gay and Hudson got home at 6am. Hudson got 4 stitches and hopefully will not have a scar. He slept a couple more hours and seems to be back to normal, with some puffiness over his eye where they put the local anesthesia.</p>
