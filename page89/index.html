            <p>Gay turned 40 today. We took the gondola down to the Tahoe Village for lunch. We had her birthday dinner at the <a href="http://www.manzanitalaketahoe.com/">Manzanita</a> restaurant at the Ritz-Carlton up the mountain from our place.</p>

            <p>Made it to Tahoe, via Reno. 3 states in one day.</p>

<p><a href="http://troyandgay.com/uploads//2010/03/l_2048_1536_491AE11E-931E-4F95-AAE1-44873E988CD6.jpeg"><img src="http://troyandgay.com/uploads//2010/03/l_2048_1536_491AE11E-931E-4F95-AAE1-44873E988CD6.jpeg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>We stayed a night in Klamath Falls, Oregon and if it weren’t for a local
brewpub I’d say it was a terrible idea. No, it was still a terrible idea – I’d have rather listened to the soothing sounds of tired kids stuck in car seats to exposing myself to the town of Klamath Falls. That place has seen better days.  One memorable moment was arriving at the brewpub and hearing as soon as Gay opened the car door, a mom pushing a baby stroller being trailed by 2 kids yell “Stop touchin’ shit!”. That’s some parentin’!</p>

<p>From there, we drove to Tahoe stopping at the Black Bear Diner in Susanville to experience some more local color, which amounts to talk of guns and the hassles of gun permits. Then for gas in Reno to check Reno off my list of places to see before I die. Not sure why Reno was on that list but Gay is glad it’s finally off it. Who is Reno for? The people who think Las Vegas is too classy?</p>

<p>The drive from Reno to Tahoe was fun through the snow-covered mountains. Tahoe feels like civilization again.</p>

            <p>We stopped for lunch outside Portland in Gresham. We picked up sandwiches from Subway and looked for a park where the kids could play after eating. We and another driver coming the opposite direction at an intersection  avoided being hit by an idiot who flew through a red light seemingly unaware that they almost slammed into 2 cars.</p>

<p>After lunch and play time at a windy park, we drove through Mt. Hood national park, by Mt. Hood and down to Bend. We checked into the hotel, The Oxford Hotel: great location, a big room, nice gym with a view and a unhurried noon check-out time. We had dinner at the original Deschutes brewpub just around the corner. The kids barely napped in the car so they went to sleep easily.</p>

<p>Bend is a sunny cute little town surrounded by snow-covered mountains. I could stay here another day or two.</p>

<p>We have a short drive today to Klamath Falls so we’re going to stop by the Deschutes Brewery before we leave Bend and get some shirts or something.</p>

            <p>On our way to Bend, Oregon…</p>

<p>After washing and cleaning the Jeep, I tried to start it to put in the garage and it wouldn’t start. It sounds like the starter is bad. <a href="http://www.jeepcommander.com/forums/showthread.php?t=5647">Googling</a> seems to show that this is a common problem with Commanders. So we took the Lexus instead and will hope that there’s no snow in Tahoe.</p>
