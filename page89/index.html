            <div class="post-content">
              <p>We were supposed to close yesterday, but the insurance, of all things, took forever and ended up being a few hours late so closing was postponed a day. This morning, we took the 10:30a ferry into Seattle to Chicago Title Co in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Center">Columbia Tower</a> for 30 minutes of signing papers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4799522333/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4118/4799522333_44470b16c6.jpg" alt="Chicago Title Company" /></a></p>

<p>Then we went to a celebratory lunch in our new neighborhood at <a href="http://www.vioscafe.com/vioscapitolhill.html">Cafe Vios</a> – a good Greek casual kid-friendly (a kids playroom inside) restaurant just a few minutes’ walk from home. I likes. One of my complaints about Seattle has always been the lack of good Greek places, but maybe that’s not true anymore with Vios.</p>

<p>On the way home, we stopped at <a href="http://www.utrechtart.com/">Utrecht</a> for some drafting supplies (tracing paper, a new scale, pencils, etc.) so we can keep playing architects for the remodel.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> We officially closed at 4pm. Conveniently, today is Friday so we celebrated with our usual Friday Manhattans.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Scripps changed the name of Recipezaar to Food.com. People have been contacting us for weeks wondering what we think. So here’s what we think, but first, a suggestion to the people upset about the change…</p>

<p>Make lemonade from these lemons: build a competitor to food.com. Do what you would do if you owned Recipezaar/food.com. This is what America and capitalism are all about. Go chase the American Dream. We are proof that even idiots can do it and be successful. You don’t need to be a genius, you just need to be willing to work hard and to keep getting up when you fall down. It’s hard work, but it’s worth it. Best of all, you have the blueprint that we never had and proof that the formula works.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Now, what we think of the change…</p>

<p>I named the site “Recipezaar” but I never liked the name; I just didn’t have a better idea for a name. Scripps didn’t either because the new name is stupid. Whoever thought that name was good is stuck in 1999 and needs to wake up. At least “Recipezaar” was unique and interesting. “Food.com” is boring. Worse, it’s inaccurate – it’s a recipe site, not a food site. They owned the food.com domain when we came on board and they were planning to introduce a 3rd site on that domain that took content from both foodnetwork.com and recipezaar.com. They would have three sites: one site for celebrity chefs, one for amateur chefs and one to bridge the gap between the two. It was a great idea. But killing off one site and being stuck with two sites, one just renamed, was a bad idea.</p>

<p>Scripps pretends that the site was inaccessible because “Recipezaar” was hard to spell. It <em>is</em> hard to spell, but so is Epicurious.com and not many people argue they should change that name. And the likelihood for typos and misspellings is why we had 30+ domain name misspellings of it to catch the mistakes and typos. People clearly had no trouble finding the site due to lack of spelling ability or typos. So it’s not a legitimate reason. And because they changed the URLs, I hope they did a good job of redirecting old links to the new site or they will lose a ton of “link love” from other sites accumulated over the last 10 years.</p>

<p>Other than the dumb name, does it matter? All the recipes are there, you can still post your recipes and the database is growing. If you like the site, use it. If you don’t, don’t. You can argue whether they’re doing the right things or the wrong things, but don’t pretend it’s anything other than your opinion. I’m somewhat sympathetic to them. People told us for years how wrong we were whenever we changed anything. The tired anti-progress chant of “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!” was always bandied about. Again, take this opportunity to build your own site and prove them wrong.</p>

<p>The true judge of whether they’re doing it right or not is whether the site is getting more or less popular. Time will tell. Unfortunately, it seems they’re getting less popular. They’re losing even more to our most direct competitor AllRecipes. That’s a travesty and a missed opportunity because AllRecipes should have been easy to beat given that Scripps owned FoodNetwork.com too. It was Scripps’ game to lose and they are definitely losing it. It just goes to show that big companies usually succeed in spite of themselves rather than because of themselves.</p>

<p>I do think this new site is an improvement over their old site. They redesigned the site the first year after they bought it and, yikes, that was a sloppy mess. The woman who was in charge hired her buddies, designers that Yahoo let go (for good reason!), to design it. This new version seems to be an improvement over that, at least.</p>

              <p>Two people gave a combined $1.4 million to a Christian Church because the church told them the apocalypse is coming. To their suprise, the date came and went so now <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/07/2947056.htm?section=justin">they want their money back</a>.</p>

<p>These people are obvious idiots, but it brings up a number of questions: What did the church say they needed the money for if the apocalypse was coming? Why do they want their money back now; have they lost faith in the promise of the apocalypse? How do such gullible and stupid people get $1.4 million in the first place?</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Christians have been promising the apocalypse for over 2,000 years. Jesus’ crucification was the first apocalypse that never came. Oops. That empty promise killed Christianity for 30+ years until Paul figured out how to better market the religion in Europe: no circumcisions + no dietary restrictions = easier life = more believers. Why are Christians still so easily bamboozled by the promise of the apocalypse? Because it’s easy to convince people something is true if they desperately want it to be true?</p>

<p>Dear Christians: the Apocalypse will never come. It’s a made-up story that was used solely to scare people into switching from Judaism to Christianity quickly: “Hurry! Believe today and you’ll be saved! Tomorrow may be too late!!” This tactic is still being used today, obviously.</p>

<p>Think about it: the dinosaurs were here long before us and lasted more than 10,000 times longer than we’ve been here. Christians believe we’re still here only because of our superior morals. Yet dinosaurs had fewer morals than we do – no 10 Commandments for them, they coveted their neighbors belongings, they stole from each other, they killed each other without a second thought, had premarital sex, etc. But our morals are supposed to be the only thing saving us so far. If God didn’t mind the evil ways of the dinosaurs and let them live for more than 150,000,000 years, why would God kill us off after just a few thousand years? Did God change his/her mind or, egads, make a mistake between the dinosaurs and us? And the dinosaurs were killed off without requiring the end of the universe. Why are we special that our end must also be the universe’s end? The dinosaurs never had such crazy ideas. The dinosaurs were right.</p>

<p>Humans will die off just like the dinosaurs did. But the universe will still be chugging along for another 15 billion years, at least. So don’t give your money away to someone telling you it’s coming soon.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>I always look at “top lists” of cities to live in, even though they’re usually chosen by dubious standards and really just meant to sell copies of the magazine in the markets they list (“Lookie! We’re on the list!”). Money magazine just did one on “the best small towns” and I was shocked to see the place I grew up, Centreville, VA, as <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2010/snapshots/PL5114440.html">#30 on the list</a>. Centreville recently became (in)famous as the hometown of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seung-Hui_Cho">the Virginia Tech murderer</a>. Centreville was a horrible horrible horrible place when I lived there. I couldn’t wait to move. So what made Money like it?</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Money says:</p>

<blockquote>Washington, D.C., is anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour and a half away, depending on traffic.</blockquote>

<p>I love that the range of travel times doesn’t even phase the editors of Money magazine. And I think they’re even optimistic about those times! It’s only <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=Centreville,+VA&amp;daddr=Washington,+DC&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=CQRzgjE_H-UoFUeoUAIdc4di-ynznkp6gUS2iTEs2skWESuTCQ%3B&amp;mra=ls&amp;sll=38.840391,-77.428877&amp;sspn=0.348171,0.220757&amp;g=Centreville,+VA&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=11">24 miles away from DC</a>, but it took 45 minutes on a light traffic day and could take 2-3 hours when traffic is bad when I lived there in the mid-1990s. I can’t imagine it’s gotten any better since then.</p>

<p>When I was working and living in an area about as far away as Centreville is from DC, I got sick of the 90-minute stop-and-go commute to my job just outside of DC that I started riding my bike to work instead. It took me 90 minutes to bike it each way (regardless of traffic, of course), which meant cars travel at the same speed as bikes and sometimes slower.</p>

<p>Incidentally, hardly a day went by that I wasn’t honked-at or yelled-at by motorists, had things thrown at me and was called “faggot” a few times, just for riding a bike. This is the behavior of affluent supposedly-educated Northern Virginians who are angry about wasting their lives in traffic. That’s another story, but I don’t see how a place filled with people like this is anything but a horrible place to live even if you don’t ride a bike.</p>

<p>The other good thing Money had to say about it:</p>

<blockquote>With major shopping centers nearby and the Bull Run Mountains an hour's drive away, Centerville [sic] lives up to its name.</blockquote>

<p>“Major shopping centers” must mean “tons of strip malls” and the “Bull Run Mountains” should be called “Bull Run Hills”. And an hour’s drive away is not close. They may as well claim it’s a beach-front community – the beach is just a three-hours’ drive away.</p>

<p>The comments from people who live there confirm that it hasn’t improved since I escaped:</p>

<blockquote>Too many people, horrible traffic, pretentious people. don't move here (or Gaithersburg) unless you like lots of people, enjoy traffic jams and aggressive drivers, and are a snob. Look further west of this town.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I love it. Centreville SUCKS...I mean Centreville is not that bad but it's the whole NOVA experience that comes with it (like it or not). Stopping at every traffic light, take off at one to stop at another. If you like sitting at 4 minute traffic lights and going 10 miles in 1hr then this place is for you. Getting out as soon as I can! Unfortunately the jobs and money are here. But unless you can afford $200K for an old run down townhouse or $160 for a condo your living in an apartment for $1,100-$2,000 a month depending on your requirements.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Townhouse Central. Nice area in Fairfax County, but I think I just lost all respect for Money's reports.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Centreville is a joke. It should be in top 5 worst places to live in the US.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Are they kidding? The traffic is a nightmare. There's no town. It's a sprawling burb
I have lived in Northern Virginia for 42 years, (I grew up in McLean) my brother owns a town house in Centreville and I lived there for two years. There is no way Centreville deserves to be on this list. I don't even see it as in the top 100 places to live in Virginia.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When did Centreville become a "historic town?" It is the epitome of suburban sprawl, with some historic Civil War sites. The town, if one can call it that, is anything but historic. C'ville is an indistinguishable suburban enclave with lots of strip malls and ubiquitous housing developments. As someone who lived in the area for 30 years (DC, Fairfax, Burke, and Centreville), there are plenty of better places to live in the DC area.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Really????? This is not a great area at all. Try living there and getting to work. Try getting anywhere on a saturday or sunday down 66. This is a middle to lower class area, probably a bit closer to middle. [Racism deleted] I dont get it. Having Gaithersburg ranked number 30 is even worse. There are 5 or 10 cities in this area alone that are much nicer places to live. Reston, Mclean, Potomac, Bethesda and Ashburn, just to name a few. This survey is terrible.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Seriously...Centreville??? I lived here when I first moved to DC. 30th in the US? What a joke. This neighborhood isn't even 30th in Northern Va. Besides...it would have to be classified as Fairfax, Va, which is a huge area with many neighborhoods. Maybe they are trying to include South Riding and beyond...but then that is Chantilly and still Fairfax county. Maybe they meant Clifton?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Terrible choice. Traffic, long commutes, suburban hell. Great for folks who like to spend a lot of time in their cars and aren't interested in cultural activities or the arts easily accessible.</blockquote>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>We went to our first block party on our new street tonight. They have a huge grill that they wheel out to the middle of the block and everyone grilled their dinner, drank beer and wine and the kids run around.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/4780491736/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4082/4780491736_0f6ab3c09f.jpg" alt="Block party" /></a>

<p>Havana and Hudson had a great time playing with all the other kids. Hudson seemed to have a crush on a girl named Campbell and spent most of his time with her. We aren’t used to just letting them run around without us watching them, but all the other older kids watched them for us. The weather was perfect. At our place on Vashon, you can’t sit outside past 8 or 9pm without getting cold, even after a 90° day because we get a cool breeze off the water. We left just before 10pm and it was still nice on Capitol Hill. Havana fell asleep in the car but Hudson was so energized he was wide awake the whole way home.</p>

<p>Everyone we met was great and everyone offered advice on the remodeling we’re going to do. It seems every house on the block has had some remodeling over the years. They all think we’re optimistic to believe it’ll only take 9-10 months. Yikes.</p>

<p>We learned a few things about our house: They really did have 13 kids. They owned a house down the street and had 10 kids in that house and then moved to our house and had 3 more; we met the couple who bought their house from them years ago. The wood floors are so well-preserved because they put red shag carpeting throughout the house. Lucky for us! The house was featured in Better Homes &amp; Gardens in the 1930s as “one of the most beautiful houses on the west coast” or something like that. That’s probably a bit of a stretch, but we’re hoping we can restore its charm and character.</p>

<p>I did an informal poll of people about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araucaria_araucana">Monkey Puzzle trees</a> in our yard and all but one would prefer to see them go – some equal my disgust of them. Even the one holdout just likes them because they’re unique (I’ll grant him that), not because they’re attractive. That’s good news because Monkey Puzzle trees are the most and only disturbing tree I’ve ever seen and I want to get rid of them while not upsetting the neighbors who I worried might like them. They also drop “leaves” that are like razor blades, so removing them is a public safety service.</p>
