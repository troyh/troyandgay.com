              <p>We just saw the Coen Brothers’ latest (and hopefully last) movie <em>No Country For Old Men</em> (no link because I don’t want to be responsible for anyone accidentally adding it to their Netflix queue). This movie somehow won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Were the other nominated movies the only other movies made last year?!</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>This movie was far far too long, totally predictable and just gore for gore’s sake. And completely pointless. Five minutes into the movie and we witness two gruesome murders. 10 minutes in and we’ve seen the carnage of over a dozen people. The rest of the movie is a cliched hunt for a guy who stole someone’s money from a drug deal gone bad (seriously, it’s <em>that</em> cliched!) and, shocker, lots more violence before it ends with a nonsensical recanting of a dream by Tommy Lee Jones.</p>

<p>The Coen Brothers made the perfect <em>Fargo</em> in 1996, but haven’t made a decent movie before or since. What happened to them in 1996? The only reason the Coen Brothers should continue to make movies is so that they can act out their psychotic fantasies in make-believe so they don’t do it in real life. The <em>Friday the 13th</em> series was more interesting than their drivel.</p>

<p>This movie is mostly just a re-hash of <em>Fargo</em> with less interesting characters, less humor and, again, more blood. Instead of the wood-chipper of <em>Fargo</em>, this movie gives us a cattle gun. Instead of the North Dakota/Minnesota accents, we get Texas accents. <em>Fargo</em> gave us long pans of desolate snow, this movie gives us long pans of desolate desert. Instead of Frances McDormand and her dopey sidekick policeman, we get Tommy Lee Jones and his dopey sidekick. If you haven’t seen this movie, skip it and watch <em>Fargo</em> instead and thank me for rescuing two hours of your life.</p>

<p>I love the reviews on Netflix, the movie wonks who fall over themselves to show how intelligent they are:</p>

<p>bq. “It is not about a specific story set in a specific place and time, but about the darkness in man, the descent of society, and how we are helpless to prevent our own downfall…its insight into humanity will ensure its place in the annals of film history”</p>

<p>bq. “The rug is purposely yanked out from under the audience as a demonstration that our actions and beliefs are ultimately futile. Nature has its own plans for each of us, blindsiding us whenever we need a reminder. In the long run, our ability to affect the world around us diminishes, yet nature (and human nature) will continue as it always has.”</p>

<p>bq. “This film is about collateral damage and that unspoken and uncomfortable feeling that is a fearful echo of the physical terror that characterizes this production.”</p>

<p>And then sane people wrote accurate reviews:</p>

<p>bq. “This is another reason to ignore the “Academy Awards” for rewarding this piece of ultra-violent crap.”</p>

<p>bq. “Slow, predictable, and a lousey ending, most of the plot was predictable, they just showed it with a little more gore. cant see why it won an oscar.”</p>

              <p>Havana took her first two (not one, but two!) steps today. She stood on her own in front of her mom and, after some coaxing, took two baby steps towards me with no help. It was enough to reach my hands and Gay broke down in tears (girls!). We didn’t get a photo or video, unfortunately.</p>

              <p>We’re expecting a baby boy in August. He and Havana will be just 16 months apart in age. We’ve compiled a long list of names, but none so far feel right to us.</p>

<p>Havana already has her t-shirt:</p>

<p>It says “Big Sister”, but she can’t read yet so she doesn’t know yet. She knows she has pink “Chucks”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Taylor_All-Stars though – she’s even pointing them out. :)</p>

              <p>“Deschutes”:http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/default.aspx, one of my favorite breweries, makes an Imperial Stout called “The Abyss”:http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/Brews/Reserve+Series/default.aspx in their “Reserve Series”. It’s brewed with licorice and molasses and is aged in oak <em>bourbon</em> barrels so I was really looking forward to it. I had the 2007 vintage last night:</p>

<p>The bottle is dipped in black wax making it hard to open. The label reads:</p>

<p>bq. It’s dark. It’s deep. It’s mysterious. This imperial stout has the immeasurable depth inviting you to explore and discover its rich complex profile. The flavor of this special brew draws you further and further with each sip. The Abyss beckons. Enjoy the journey.</p>

<p>It’s a heavy beer that smells like a big red wine and tastes slightly sweet, presumably from the molasses, and chocolatey, like a good Imperial stout. There was lots of bitterness, but not as powerful as the 65 IBUs that they say it is. And the aftertaste stays with you for a while, so it took me a good hour-and-a-half to drink it. That’s good, because at 11% alcohol you don’t want to drink it quickly.</p>

<p>It’s rated in the 100th percentile (!) and a “4.17 on RateBeer”:http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/deschutes-the-abyss/65832/ and an “A+ on BeerAdvocate”:http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/63/34420. I can’t argue with either site. This is a great beer.</p>

              <p>Crikey, a week into Spring and it’s snowing!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2368712023/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2195/2368712023_72262b65f4.jpg" alt="IMG_2479.JPG" /></a></p>

<p>It snowed on Wednesday evening, yesterday (followed by sun) and now today. It’s supposed to snow tomorrow too. None of it has stuck but today’s snow appears to be sticking now.</p>

<p><strong>1:30pm update:</strong> Still snowing and we have about 1/4-inch of snow.</p>

<p><strong>3:30pm update:</strong> Snow is gone and the sun is out. Just confirms the adage about Seattle weather: If you don’t like the weather in Seattle, wait 15 minutes.</p>
