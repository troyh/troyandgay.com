            <p>With all the bleak talk about our economy and the lousy performance of the stock market over “the last year”:http://finance.google.com/finance?chdnp=0&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=1&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1204664400000&amp;chddm=98923&amp;q=INDEXSP:.INX (down 5.61%), I wondered if the stock market is <em>really</em> lower than it should be right now. I plotted the value of the S&amp;P 500 since January 2, 1990 and compared it to the desired 10% annual growth rate:</p>

<p>The green line shows what the stock market would have done had it done a stable 10% return every year. The blue line shows the actual prices of the S&amp;P 500. So, yes, the stock market is lower than where it “should be” right now. The dot-com bubble and crash were bad, but today we’re almost at the historical peak.</p>

<p>“Roethlisberger signed a $102 million 8-year contract”:http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08063/862127-66.stm?cmpid=steelers.xml. He’s the highest-paid Steeler ever and possibly the highest-paid player in the NFL. That’s justified… he’s been one of the top 3 QBs in all of his only 4 years in the NFL, including a Super Bowl win. I hope the Steelers can improve their offensive line this year to protect Roethlisberger better than they have the last couple years. But they made it harder by letting Alan Faneca go. “He signed with the New York Jets”:http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08062/861895-66.stm?cmpid=steelers.xml becoming the highest-paid offensive lineman in NFL history with a $40 million 5-year contract.</p>

<p>Today is the 11-year anniversary of my first day at Microsoft. I remember this because of the date: 3/3. How did I end up here? I had always wanted to move to San Francisco since visiting the area several times on business. My employer, a software consulting company, was trying to open an office in San Jose and they were going to have me open the office. They dragged their feet for almost a year and by that time, Microsoft offered me a job so I took it so I could at least get to the west coast. I figured getting to the west coast and having it completely paid-for by Microsoft would make it easier to eventually move to San Francisco.</p>

<p>My plan was to work at Microsoft for several years, say 5 or so, and then start my own software company in San Francisco. I met Gay, we started dating in 1998, I quit Microsoft in 1999 and somehow convinced Gay to start a software business with me. I’m still here in Seattle even though I told myself I’d never want to live in rainy Seattle for long. It turns out that I love Seattle, including the rain.</p>

            <p>Raul Castro, the new President, has “already signed two human rights treaties”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/01/world/americas/01cuba.html?ex=1362027600&amp;en=ca823ad5997eb8aa&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss:</p>

<p>bq. One of the pacts, the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, guarantees “civil and political freedom,” including the right to self-determination, peaceful assembly, freedom of religion, privacy, <em>freedom to leave a country</em>, and equal protection before the law.</p>

<p>Does that mean that Cubans can leave Cuba?</p>
