            <p>Consumer Reports gave “my car”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/01/05/new-car-2008-lexus-ls-460/, the Lexus LS 460L, “99 out of 100 points”:http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/new-cars/news/2007/04/top-picks-for-2007-4-07/overview/0704_top-picks-2007.htm and ranked it #1 in the Luxury Sedan category in their 2008 Best &amp; Worst Cars:</p>

<p>bq. With a score of 99 out of 100 in our road test, the LS is our highest-rated vehicle. It provides a no-compromise environment of comfort and roominess, coupled with an isolating quietness. It also delivers quick acceleration and relatively good fuel economy. This car is brimming with electronic amenities, but the controls are easy to use. “See the video”:http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1329233564/bclid1432845447/bctid1407927650</p>

<p>I’m not a fan of Consumer Reports and their empty/half/full circle rating scheme and the emphasis they put on things consumers shouldn’t care about – or, at least, the things I don’t care about – but they do occasionally get things right. :)</p>

<p>And I don’t have the LS 460L, I have the LS 460 (no L).</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Buying something that is made in the US <em>just because it’s made in the US</em> is bad for the US. And if you’re paying more to buy patriotically, it’s bad for you personally. It seems like it’s a good idea to help your fellow Americans to buy products they make, and it <em>is</em> good for <em>those</em> people, but it’s bad for everyone else in the country. Trade with other countries helps the US prosper.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Imagine you want to buy a product and have a choice of one made in your country and one made in another country. Assuming that both are of equal quality (or good enough quality for your needs), you should buy the cheaper one, regardless of where it’s made. If you buy the one made in the US, you pay more, leaving less money for you to buy other things. Having less money is bad for you. It’s also bad for the US because you didn’t give any money to the people in the other country.</p>

<p>How can giving money to another country help the US? The people in the other country are just like you, they need products too. The money you send to them when you buy things allows them to buy American-made products, if they choose. If a US company produces the better product for them, the Americans who make that product profit.</p>

<p>Why do we need the other country to buy from us? There are 6 billion people in the world, i.e., potential buyers of American-made products. There are 300 million Americans, that’s 5% of the world’s consumers. If America doesn’t sell products to the rest of the world, every American needs to spend 20 times more on American-made products than they do now. If you have 2 TVs, you need to buy 38 more (assuming you can find an American-made TV). If you buy a case of Coca-Cola a month, you need to buy 20 cases per month – if you can’t drink that much, just pour it down the drain and be happy that you’re helping the employees of Coca-Cola you’ll never meet. You have to do this for <em>every</em> product you buy. Americans simply can’t do that any more than the people in other countries can do that. So we do need other countries to buy American-made products.</p>

<p>What if we buy foreign-made products but the other country doesn’t play fair and refuses to buy from the US? Even better! This is called a “trade surplus” in your country (your country exports more than it imports) and a “trade deficit” in the other country (their country imports more than it exports). A trade surplus is good for your country for the same reason it’s good for you personally: if you received (imported) more goods than you paid for (exported), you’d be pretty happy. Obviously, it’s in the best interests of the other country to get something back when they send something to your country, so they will buy from US companies too.</p>

<p>And if they still refuse to trade? Technically, trade is not about exchanging actual products, trade is done in money. US dollars are given to the other country. If the other country takes the dollars but doesn’t spend them, they are essentially burning the pieces of paper the dollars are printed on. Less dollars in existence makes you wealthier because each of your dollars are worth more than they used to be. So if we take their products and give them money they don’t use, they’ve been cheated, not the US.</p>

<p>But they will just exchange dollars into their currency and they’ve still cheated the US, right? They can’t do that. Exchanging currency is not magic where one currency is transformed into the other. When you exchange currency you are selling one currency and accepting another currency as payment. If no one wants the currency you’re trying to sell, it’s worthless, just like trying to sell anything that no one wants. If they are refusing to buy American-made products, dollars don’t help them so no one will want dollars because there’s nothing they can buy with them. So dollars are worthless to them in that case. Once again, they’ve essentially burned the dollars you gave them, which makes you wealthier.</p>

<p>So if we trade with them, they will trade with us.</p>

<p>What about the dangers of making other countries wealthy enough to threaten us economically and/or militarily? This is one-sided thinking. The belief here is that money goes from your country to the other country but money never returns to your country from the other country. As I explained above, that won’t happen. Well, it won’t happen unless the US makes lousy products that people in the other country don’t want. But if US companies continue to make products people want, the US will be fine economically and, thanks to taxes, militarily as well. So the companies in the US have to compete. What’s new about that?   Competition makes you stronger, lack of competition makes you lazy and weaker. Buying American-made products simply because they’re American-made makes America lazy and weak.</p>

            <a class="post-link" href="/2008/02/26/always-pay-cash-for-a-car.html">Always pay cash for a car</a>
          </h3>
            <p>Never, ever take out a loan to buy a car – always pay cash. Think of a car as a really bad investment because it is, it is guaranteed to be worth less in the future. Forget about the classic car phenomenon where cars actually appreciate in value, they don’t, they just seem like they do because of inflation. And even if they did actually increase in value, you’d have to keep your car for 25 years or more and work very hard to maintain it over the years. And definitely don’t drive it, that’ll hurt its chances of becoming valuable.</p>

<p>If you wouldn’t borrow money to buy an investment you knew was going to be worth less in the future, you shouldn’t do it with a car. The only reason to buy a car that you can’t afford is for emotional reasons (or worse, you want to impress strangers). If you do that, realize that you are paying a lot for those emotional reasons. And if this is the way you think about all purchases, accept that you will never be financially-sound. That’s okay too, money isn’t the most important thing in life and driving a new BMW is more fun than driving a used Honda, but if you do this you aren’t allowed to complain about your lack of money. :)</p>

<p>If you don’t have the cash for your car, buy a less expensive car that you can pay for with cash. If you don’t have the cash to pay for a new car, buy a used car. If you still don’t have enough cash, find a less expensive car. If you still don’t have enough cash, save until you do. If you don’t want to save, go buy a car that costs more than you can afford, but realize that you’re making a financial mistake, one that will take you a while to recover from, if you can recover from it. And don’t claim that you can’t get a decent car for cheap, eBay “shows”:http://motors.completed.shop.ebay.com/Cars-Trucks___W0QQLHQ5fCompleteZ1QQModelYearf0c65f14Z20071774c5Q7c20061774c4Q7c20051774c3Q7c20041774c2Q7c20031774c1Q7c20021774c0Q7c20011774bfQ7c20001774beQQ_attrZ10239Q2bQ2d24Q2c39Q2bQ2d24Q2cQQ_catZ6001QQ_fxdZ1QQ_gcsZ13QQ_ipgZ50QQ_pcatsZ6000QQ_sopZ2QQ_pgnZ42 plenty of decent cars have been sold for as little as $1,000.</p>

<p>Now that you have the cash to buy your car, if you still think a loan is the way to go, keep reading.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>For those that do have the cash to pay for a car, the rationale to take out a loan is because you think you can beat the interest rate with other investments. The idea is that if the APR for the car loan is lower than what you could make in another investment, such as the stock market, it’s smarter to invest the money you’d normally put into the car in that investment. The difference in the return on the investment and the interest on the loan is your profit. It works in theory, but of course, it’s risky. Paying cash for your car is risk-free – you are guaranteed to only pay what you paid for the car.</p>

<p>The APR on car loans are typically 6-8% these days and the highest-growth investments are stocks and the stock market does 10% per year. It sounds good except for one thing: the stock market doesn’t do 10% every year, it has done 10% a year <em>on average</em> over 100+ years. Some years it does much worse, some years it does better. 2007, for example, only did 5.49%, 2005 was worse at 4.91% and 2000-2002 were actually negative growth at -9.1%, -11.89% and -22.10%! Other years were better; 2006 did 15.79%, 2004 did 10.88% and 2003 did 28.69%! You can’t ignore the bad years when you have your money invested and you don’t know when those bad years are coming.</p>

<p>bq. If you have a secret investment or a “great stock pick” that you think is guaranteed to do better than the general stock market, great, but what are you doing reading this or even buying a car now? Take all your money, all your family’s money and all your friend’s money and make a fortune so that you can always pay cash for cars in the future! Realistically, you don’t have a sure-thing, so face it, trying to beat your APR with an investment is a gamble.</p>

<p>If you still think that your car loan APR is low enough to make you comfortable trying to beat it, let’s walk through the process to point out some things you may not have considered. The game is that you are taking a pile of cash, investing it somewhere and watching it grow and hoping that it turned into more money than you paid the bank over the years in interest on your loan. Each month, however, you have to make a loan payment. Those payments chip away at the amount you have invested and, of course, the less you have invested, the better your investment has to do to make up for the decrease in your investment.</p>

<p>bq. To be clear: $10 earning 10% gives you $1 in gain, but if you have to pay $1 to your loan, the remaining $9 earning 10% only gives you 90¢. So the $9 has to earn 11.1% to match what the $10 was capable of doing at 10%.</p>

<p>When you’re taking money out of your investment to make your payments you have to pay Capital Gains taxes too, which are 15% of your profit. You probably also have to pay trading fees to sell your investment if you’re invested in the stock market. These can be as high as $30 per trade, which cuts into the amount you have invested and (hopefully) growing, making it even more difficult to beat your loan’s APR. To make matters worse, there’s inflation. If you make an investment and you end up with a gain that didn’t outpace inflation, you’ve still lost money in real terms. If you pay cash for the car, you don’t have this problem because you didn’t invest the money (but you didn’t give yourself a chance to beat inflation, either).</p>

<p>So to beat your car loan with your investment, your investment has to beat 5 things: 1) the loan’s APR, 2) the reduction in capital investment, 3) Capital Gains taxes, 4) trading fees and 5) inflation. A simple spreadsheet can help you add these together to figure out what growth rate your investment would need to achieve to beat all of those and to break-even. I’ve done that for APRs ranging from 1% to 10% and for 3, 5 and 7-year car loans:</p>

<p>What these show is the Total ROI you’d need to make at various APRs and loan lengths. For example, a 5-year loan at 6% would require your investment to earn 29% over 5 years to break-even. Using simple numbers, a 29% ROI means that a $100 investment would need to grow to $129 after 5 years. The amount of the loan, i.e., how expensive the car you’re buying is, doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>Before I continue, for those who think they got a great APR:</p>

<p>bq. 0% (or very low) APRs are more and more common. Before you think the car dealer is really nice or really dumb, the car makers that do this do it because they are having trouble selling their cars, which probably means their cars aren’t very good or their cars are overpriced. If a car is a bad investment, a lousy car is a really bad investment. As far as I know, only GM and Chrysler have ever done this, Toyota and Honda don’t need to. Caveat emptor.</p>

<p>bq. Dealers only give these low APR loans on cars you pay sticker price (or close to it). They do this because they are making their profit now rather than over time. Cars at sticker price have large profit margins built-in. The dealer is trying to fool you into paying more by luring you with a low APR (“Pay attention to my left hand and ignore my right hand!”). Don’t buy a car at sticker price. And definitely don’t pay sticker price just so you can get a low APR. You’re better off negotiating a lower price for the car and paying a higher APR. A lower price also decreases the sales tax you’ll pay.</p>

<p>You should only accept financial risk when you don’t mind losing the money or when you have time to mitigate the risk. How much risk are we talking about?</p>

<p>For example, looking at 1999, the S&amp;P 500 return for the year was 21.04%, 107.55% for the 3-years ending in 1999, 251.11% for the 5 years ending in 1999 and 291.61% for the 7 years ending in 1999. (Before you get too excited about the years leading up to 1999, that was the dot-com bubble years).</p>

<p>To gauge the historic risk for yourself, look at the tables above to figure out what the total return you’d need to achieve for your loan’s APR and length. Using these tables, you can quickly determine the probability that you will be able to match your loan’s APR. Of course, the past is not a good indicator of future stock market performance, but it’s all we got. You’ll find that the chances you’ll be successful range from 69% to 86%, meaning that, depending on your APR and your loan length, you have a fairly good chance of matching your loan’s APR, but also a good chance of not matching it. That’s risk. Of course, if you pay cash there is no risk, you are guaranteed to break-even.</p>

<p>Now, remember, we’re talking only about breaking even. There’s little reason to take on any risk unless there’s the chance of a significant gain, right? To have a higher gain, you need to risk more, i.e., buy a more expensive car. If your car is not expensive, even a good gain above paying off the interest on the loan doesn’t amount to much, and is probably not worth the risk. You’ll have to be your own judge of that.</p>

<p>So the summary is: if you are wealthy enough to buy an expensive car, you have the cash to do it and enjoy risking a lot of money, take out a car loan and have fun. If you’re anyone else, don’t do it.</p>

            <p>Slate “compares environmental differences between the paper and electronic versions of newspapers”:http://www.slate.com/id/2185143/ and concludes, in my view, that it’s likely a wash. Besides, over time, things that consume electricity (servers and home computers) are becoming more energy-efficient over time, which will make the electronic version the clear winner eventually.</p>

<p>Even so, I believe that consuming more paper is better for the environment than consuming less paper. If we use less paper, paper companies need smaller tree farms, so they sell that property which will be used for parking lots, houses, shopping malls and other things besides trees. But ultimately, I’m on the side of electronic media because it’ll be less expensive to distribute, which will make more people consume it, which will make more people educated. More educated people makes it more likely that we’ll solve the environmental problem through technology and innovation rather than the untenable “consume less mentality.”.</p>
