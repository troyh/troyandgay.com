              <p>We’re expecting a baby boy in August. He and Havana will be just 16 months apart in age. We’ve compiled a long list of names, but none so far feel right to us.</p>

<p>Havana already has her t-shirt:</p>

<p>It says “Big Sister”, but she can’t read yet so she doesn’t know yet. She knows she has pink “Chucks”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Taylor_All-Stars though – she’s even pointing them out. :)</p>

              <p>“Deschutes”:http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/default.aspx, one of my favorite breweries, makes an Imperial Stout called “The Abyss”:http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/Brews/Reserve+Series/default.aspx in their “Reserve Series”. It’s brewed with licorice and molasses and is aged in oak <em>bourbon</em> barrels so I was really looking forward to it. I had the 2007 vintage last night:</p>

<p>The bottle is dipped in black wax making it hard to open. The label reads:</p>

<p>bq. It’s dark. It’s deep. It’s mysterious. This imperial stout has the immeasurable depth inviting you to explore and discover its rich complex profile. The flavor of this special brew draws you further and further with each sip. The Abyss beckons. Enjoy the journey.</p>

<p>It’s a heavy beer that smells like a big red wine and tastes slightly sweet, presumably from the molasses, and chocolatey, like a good Imperial stout. There was lots of bitterness, but not as powerful as the 65 IBUs that they say it is. And the aftertaste stays with you for a while, so it took me a good hour-and-a-half to drink it. That’s good, because at 11% alcohol you don’t want to drink it quickly.</p>

<p>It’s rated in the 100th percentile (!) and a “4.17 on RateBeer”:http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/deschutes-the-abyss/65832/ and an “A+ on BeerAdvocate”:http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/63/34420. I can’t argue with either site. This is a great beer.</p>

              <p>Crikey, a week into Spring and it’s snowing!</p>

<p>It snowed on Wednesday evening, yesterday (followed by sun) and now today. It’s supposed to snow tomorrow too. None of it has stuck but today’s snow appears to be sticking now.</p>

<p><strong>1:30pm update:</strong> Still snowing and we have about 1/4-inch of snow.</p>

<p><strong>3:30pm update:</strong> Snow is gone and the sun is out. Just confirms the adage about Seattle weather: If you don’t like the weather in Seattle, wait 15 minutes.</p>

<p>This one has more of a dry coffee flavor, but it’s a little watery. Not as good as “Anderson Valley’s version”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/25/anderson-valley-oatmeal-stout/.</p>

              <p>My brother works at “ColorCraft”:http://www.colorcraft-va.com/ in Virginia and President Bush “visited yesterday”:http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/03/images/20080326-1_p032608cg-0191jpg-515h.html. He shook his hand and got a photograph with him. It’ll take a few weeks to get the photograph since the Secret Service doesn’t allow bystanders to carry cameras.</p>

<p>I think my brother dislikes the Bush administration even more than I do, but he said this about him:</p>

<p>bq. …there is no denying the man’s personal charisma. He is much different on TV and radio than he is in person. After meeting him, I can see why he has such a following among those that have met him. He is humorous, at ease with all kinds of people, and very personable.</p>

<p>bq. Physically, he is about 5 ft 10 or so. He is actually much thinner than he appears on TV as well</p>
