          <p>On our way to the house, we stopped to pick up lunch at Bakery Nouveau, our new favorite bakery, in West Seattle. We met the interior designers at the house to talk about some things as well as with the tile guy who had some questions for the designers and us about tile details in the bathrooms. We also walked through the basement electrical switches and outlet locations with the electrician.</p>

<p>The plumbers were also there continuing their work and the last of the attic rafters were going into place. After that, we went to Gay’s baby doc for the weekly checkup.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>We lost power on Monday night during Monday Night Football. Thanks to the generator, we hardly even noticed. But on Tuesday, Comcast went down so we lost the internet, which is painful. Power came back on early Thanksgiving morning but Comcast didn’t. By Saturday, I called Comcast about it. They had some people on the island working on the problem so one came over to the house. He couldn’t help, of course, but he did give me a new DOCSIS 3.0 (faster than DOCSIS 2.0) modem that I’ve been putting off exchanging myself at the Comcast store in Seattle. As luck would have it, they fixed the internet in the neighborhood while he was here and he got the modem set up and our service upgraded to take advantage of the faster modem.</p>

<p>Now we’re getting 40Mbps download and almost 4Mbps upload! Amazing. When we ran Recipezaar years ago, we paid hundreds of dollars a month to get 5Mbps in both directions at the colocation facility.</p>

          <p>There were snow flurries yesterday but some of it stuck this morning. Havana doesn’t have school on Mondays, but the Vashon School District is delayed 2 hours, which means Hudson’s preschool was canceled. This is the first school closure our kids have ever had.</p>

          <p>We took the 10:10a ferry, made a couple stops including one at The Beer Junction where I picked up some great winter beers – the fall/winter beer season seems to get better every year! We went to the Schuchart/Dow office, saw Doug and Katie and dropped off Thanksgiving gifts for them and Jim, and then went to the house to check on the progress and drop off Thanksgiving gifts for the guys there.</p>

<p>More windows are boarded up so from the outside it looks like it’s a condemned house and it’s dark inside. Plumbing and electrical rough-in work has begun, the basement floor etching was being done and they were still working on the attic structural work. The attic work will take at least another week and the plumbing and electrical work should be finished the week after Thanksgiving. That’s when I can do the low-voltage work.</p>

<p>On the way home, we stopped at <a href="http://www.talaricoswest.com/Talaricos/Home.html">Talarico’s</a> to get pizza for dinner. Mark recommended the place and said the pizzas are large. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5188710448/in/photostream/">He wasn’t kidding</a>, I’ve never seen a bigger pizza! I couldn’t even fit the box through the door to our house without angling it.</p>

          <p><a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/11/10/we-should-let-gm-and-ford-die/">I didn’t like</a> that Obama bailed-out General Motors and thought it’d be a mistake, but it turns out that it was smart. Not only is GM profitable again, very profitable even, and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704104104575623061936893220.html?mod=WSJ_business_whatsNews">today had a new successful IPO</a>. American taxpayers have been paid-back for half the investment and the rest is sure to be repaid too. Obama and GM want the Federal Government out as soon as possible because it’s a conflict of interest to have the government be invested in a corporation, but it’s hard to argue that Obama hasn’t been the best GM CEO in many decades. I’m glad I was wrong. Good job and good luck, GM.</p>
