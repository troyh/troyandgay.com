            <p>My godmother Jean Craigen died last week.  I have not been close to my godparents since I’ve been in high school, but my mother has been.  I have a tremendous amount of respect for them both, and feel very sorry for Pat – I just don’t know what he’ll do without her.  Jean was perhaps the nicest lady in the world and had a distinctive voice and cadence that I always adored.  I would have missed work and traveled to the funeral Tuesday, but mom said if I could make my own peace with Jean’s death, then coming to provide support might be futile – I’d be lost in the sea of her admirers.  I hope to make a more meaningful visit to Pat later this year, and I’m glad she was well-remembered and loved.
Several other people have died…

My great aunt Babe passed away recently.  I was very angry with my father’s side of the family for not bothering to notify me about it until weeks later.  She was one of the more colorful relatives on that side of the family and lived here in Seattle.  I most certainly would have attended the wake had I known.
My neighbor down the street died after a long battle with cancer.  We’d met “cancer man” shortly after we moved here after an unfortunate incident with our dog Ouzo.  We got into a bit of a fight with him that we deeply regretted, and he did too.  We saw him again a couple of days later and both sides apologized profusely.  I can’t imagine I would have cared as much had the same occurrance happened in Seattle, esp. in our old neighborhood.  I felt like that incident signaled that the change of moving from Seattle to Vashon was much bigger than a zip code.  I’ve spent lots of time chatting with Mark and Mary at the bus stop with their kids since.</p>

<p>Friday I got the opportunity to make a salad for a potluck dinner provided by our neighbors for the many visitors and extended family in town for Mark’s funeral service.  I was glad to get the opportunity to do something – we didn’t attend the service.  Funny isn’t it that I actually gave something to basically strangers, but for the family deaths I only sent cards.</p>

            <p>Running a store that customers enter during business hours is difficult.  Try running one that is open 24 hours a day, which can fill up or the doors just arbitrarily jam so no one can get in – sometimes not even you.  Oh, and it is mostly obscured what the heck is going on at a given moment.  Try as you might to work all weekend and improve “door” and “product” performance…sometimes you go through severe growing pains…and the people who visit your store (for free) will complain, but more than anything you get frustrated with yourself for not being able to fix it.</p>

            <p>A few hiccups in the new caching mechanism, but they seem to be mostly ironed out now. But I was woken up by a squawking pager at 5am, at 6am and at 7am. Fortunately, it was nothing too serious and I had my laptop on the nightstand and could deal with stuff quickly without leaving bed. By 7am, I was up and by 10am had fixed a few bugs. And it’s running really well so far.</p>

<p>Oh, and it is <em>FAST!!!</em></p>

            <p>Except for the 2 trips to the vet and late lunch break of pot stickers, Gay &amp; I have been slaving away in front of our computers working on a <em>major</em> change to Recipezaar’s caching mechanism. We feel pretty good about it at this point and are working on pushing it up to the site. Hopefully this will go well tonight, but will require lots of monitoring and nail-biting.</p>
