          <p>My mom was here for a visit this weekend.  Friday potluck with Gary &amp; Nancy and John &amp; Deborah…so much fun, so much wine.   Hilariously, Nancy revealed her jealously of her granddaughter (perhaps a common syndrome, I dunno, I found it facinating) and we had a regular Prozac Nation group session.  Funny.  The effortless honesty of these folks makes me proud to call them my friends and perhaps is a sharp contrast to other relationships.</p>

<p>Sunday we had my mom’s cousins for dinner, Jimmy &amp; Donnie and Linda &amp; Mike.  They all tease each other so much Troy was confused as to who was married to who with all the bickering.  I could…

…listen to Jimmy tell stories and make faces all night, but it was a conversation with Mike that hangs with me.  They are best friends with their kids (who are my age).  No really, they all go on vacation together every year, and do everything together.  Not in a Mormony way, but because they all just love to have fun.  Mike told me how much he loves his grandchildren too and how he wants to take his grandkids fishing and teach them stuff.  He wants to be like his dad was to his kids: available.  When you are young and  making a living you can’t always be available.  He told me “don’t wait too long to have kids, because you don’t want to miss out on really being able to enjoy being a grandparent.”</p>

If they do this, they’ll be in Sony’s boat, where their content biz conflicts with their hardware biz. Full disclosure: I’m an Apple shareholder, I download music for free (just to see if it’s worth buying) and I luvs my Mac and my iPod.</p>

          <p>I think some of the names in the middle east sound so nice: “Kabul”, “Qatar” (I pronounce ‘Ku-TAR’, not ‘cutter’), “Al-Nasiriyah”, “Afghanistan”, “Kandahar”, “Basra”, “Kirkuk”, “Tikrit” and “Baghdad”. Even “Iraq” is a cool name (but not “Iran”, that’s a Flock of Seagulls <a href="http://www.aflockofseagulls.co.uk/IRan.txt">song</a>). Iraq even has a great Internet top-level domain name: iq.</p>

          <p>Dinner last night with old friends to celebrate Steve’s life change: he’s quiting his oppressive job and moving back to Austin, Texas.  His demeanor last night was completely different than the last few times we’ve seen him.  Though I’ll miss the incisive criticism of his old job (his last raise was the equivalent of “an extra bag of fritos at lunch”; his manager once explained with regard to their technology “the cell phone is, essentially, a communications device”), I am happy that he’s decided to put his own well-being first, leave and downsize.  Surprisingly…

…we ended up talking much more about Terri’s situation and soon she was ready to quit and move (home) too.  I couldn’t be more thrilled because I think she really had let herself drift into a unhealthy space (a job that robbed her of self-esteem and required weeklong separation from her husband).
Frankly, I was in a similar situation myself along with others who once worked for paper money (stock options).   They don’t call them “The Golden Handcuffs” for nothing.  The tragedy is when the potential that they will ever pay off dissolves, and you are left working at an unrewarding job staring at an Excel spreadsheet and waiting.</p>
