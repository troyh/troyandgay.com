The quality of iChat + iSight is stunning. I’ve done video conferences with people on high-end equipment before and this is far better both in sound and picture quality. The video quality still isn’t TV quality, but it is close and does 30 frames per second (which is what TV does). I have seen the future of telecommunication and this is it.</p>

<p>Now I just wish I knew more people with Macs to chat with. <img src="/img/smile.gif" alt="" /></p>

            <p>My <a href="http://apple.com/isight">iSight</a> arrived today. It’s classic great Apple packaging and most of it is well-designed. But the mounting system(s) is terrible design. To assemble/disassemble it from the mounting base, it comes apart in five pieces. It’s all designed to make it look good when it’s mounted, but surely they could’ve come up with a better design.</p>

<p>The mounting situation is horrible for anyone without a laptop. The only mount to mount it on the back of a flat panel display has a sticky base so it’s more or less permanent. Not a good idea. And the Apple displays are curved in the back no there’s no flat surface to mount the base properly. But zip ties to the rescue… I mounted it like <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dayman/isight.jpg">this guy</a> did. Not pretty, but it works until Apple or a 3rd party comes out with a better mount.</p>

<p>iChat AV is buggy still too.</p>

When only the largest companies support something, you can be sure it’s bad for consumers.</p>
