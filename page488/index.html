              <p>CNet has yet another article on <a href="http://rss.com.com/2100-1040-960294.html?type=pt&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=news">.Mac subscriber growth</a> with a new total of 180,000 subscribers: <em>…that total pales in comparison with the number of people who used iTools. Before Apple announced plans to replace the free iTools suite of Web services with the paid .Mac service, the company claimed about 2.2 million subscribers.</em></p>

<p>Why is that bad? An 8% free-to-fee rate is good, especially considering the high annual price. Who thought they’d get 100%??? At $50-100 per subscriber, that’s a $9-18 million business. Not bad considering all they do is provide a WebDAV server and web mail.</p>

<p>Consider MSCI’s large-cap index, which will include the 300 American companies with the largest market capitalizations. Without a buffer zone, the index would have to sell a stock as soon as its market-cap ranking dropped to 301st, and buy it back if it rose back to 300th. But MSCI will have a buffer zone of 225 to 400 – meaning that a stock won’t be sold until it falls to 401st, or repurchased until it rises back to 225th.</p>

<p>While the zones will reduce turnover, their impact on fund returns is likely to be small. That is because, when buying or selling stocks, most fund companies that offer index funds just transfer shares from one fund to another. Mr. Tint estimates that this practice, known as crossing, already eliminates as much as 80 percent of the transaction costs that index funds would otherwise have to pay.</p>

              <p>We went into Seattle (again) yesterday and over to the Eastside. Went to Crate &amp; Barrel and bought a couple sets of glasses and then to Staples for (free) office supplies. Then to Gerhard &amp; Tracy’s housewarming party at their new house in Lakemont. Then we went to dinner at <a href="http://www.brasa.com/">Brasa</a> with Renuka Abayanayaka – he quit  and is leaving for Sri Lanka on Monday!</p>
