<p>We had Eva’s birthday party this afternoon. Her entire preschool class came. Kelly, her first nanny, came over from Vashon too. Eva does not even remember her, although Havana and Hudson do.</p>

<p>We had <a href="http://www.animalencounters.com">Animal Encounters</a> bring animals, including bunny rabbits, a baby wallaby and a chinchilla. Eva got to feed the baby wallaby.</p>
