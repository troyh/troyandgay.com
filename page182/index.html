          <p>The war is finally over, Blu-ray won. Congratulations, Sony. But plastic discs are temporary, movies will be downloaded. We can already do it today, we just have to buy a proprietary device (“Apple TV”:http://apple.com/appletv, “Vudu”:http://www.vudu.com/, etc.) or use a computer connected to a TV. The next war will be between online services. The factors involved in this war will be the cost of the device, selection of movies, convenience and ease-of-use. I’d bet on Apple TV, Apple excels in all of those areas except hardware pricing, but they continue to prove that people value money less than the other three. And “they are successful”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/02/26/itunes-is-2-people-like-plastic-discs-less/ in their online music service, so they have the experience.</p>

          <p>“iTunes is the #2 music retailer”:http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/apwire/3b1598c8ab1bfa1ede9001d01f339a74.htm in the US, behind Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart may be cheap, but iTunes is convenient. The report clearly shows that CDs are dying, but Wal-Mart dropped their online store “two months ago”:http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/071228/wal_mart_movie_downloads.html to focus on selling plastic discs. Amazon used to be #4, presumably because they sold CDs. Now that they have their download store open, they’ve fallen from #4 to #5 since “June 2007”:http://www.afterdawn.com/news/archive/10155.cfm, despite “good”:http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/mini-review/amazon-non+drm-mp3-store-now-in-public-beta-easy-to-use-303295.php “reviews”:http://gigaom.com/2007/09/25/amazon-mp3-vs-apple-itunes-whos-better-now/ of the service. It’s all about the iPod integration, I think. iTunes will be #1.</p>

<p>She often stands on her own, although I don’t think she realizes she’s doing it on her own. She can generally get anywhere in the house, even climb a few stairs. But she still thinks she needs to hold your hands to really get going.</p>
