              <p>Gay &amp; I went to <a href="http://www.cityoftacoma.org/10Home/default.asp">Tacoma</a> this morning to attend the funeral service for Gene McTee, who died suddenly of a stroke last week at the age of 72. Gene’s wife of 50 years, Shirley, and my mom are cousins so we went to the service since my mom and dad couldn’t (they live in Florida). I had met them a few times while my parents were visiting Seattle the last few years and they attended our wedding last summer, which was the last time I saw Gene.</p>

              <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/t49635oij78.jpg" alt="bcta" />After a string of real stinkers (we’re still arguing about who put <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chasing_liberty/">Chasing Liberty</a> on our Blockbuster queue), we’ve resumed my “Alice’s” film fest by seeing <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bob_and_carol_and_ted_and_alice/">“Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice”</a> (a follow up to <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/alice_doesnt_live_here_anymore/">“Alice Doesn’t Live Here Any More”</a>).  Troy thought a wife-swapping (I say “husband-swapping”) movie was in poor taste so soon after our own wedding, but the movie less about swinging,  than the emptiness in certain truth-telling in relationships, not just Bob &amp; Carol’s but also Carol &amp; Alice’s….  The most hilarious scene is the one with Ted &amp; Alice in the bedroom trying to negotiate sex.  It would be difficult to put my finger on another movie that highlighted more clearly the difference between men and women.</p>

              <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/desertfox.jpg" alt="desert fox" />One of my relatives is in Iraq (I’m being vague because you really aren’t supposed to talk about where anyone in the military is or what they are doing, even though he is civilian, it seems safer).  This is a picture of a fox he spies every day on his lunch walk.  You can see the base airport in the background.  He’ll only be there for a few months, and thanks to email and digital cameras he is still quite close to home.  I’m really thankful for this picture (instead of the suicide bombing last week), because when I read the news and think of him, I can think of him on his walks, following the growth of this desert fox and her cubs. </p>

              <p>In an effort to preserve our own sanity, we’ve instituted a voluntary 72 hour television boycott this week in an effort to prevent even a glimpse of a painful Bush sound bite.  As a result, we also missed the, I’m assuming, under-covered protests as well.  <a href="http://centricle.com/photos/2005/01/21/">Great photos here</a> and <a href="http://andiamnotlyingforreal.blogspot.com/2005/01/protest-sign-gallery.html">great signs</a> make me proud we have a country founded on free speech.  Four years seems like a mighty long time right now.</p>
