          <p>I didn’t even know they were making this into a movie. <a href="http://hitchhikers.movies.go.com/main.html">View the trailer</a> (press the red button). I read all four books of the trilogy when I was a kid. That’s how I learned that the meaning of life is 42 and how useful babel fish are.</p>

          <p>[](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&amp;id=0&amp;t=45)After several attempts in the last few months, I’ve finally switched to “Firefox”:http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/index.html as my default browser and I like it! It’s easier to access the tabs (Cmd+1 for tab 1, Cmd+2 for tab 2, etc.), other apps open windows in new tabs so less clutter on my screen, it’s fast, smooth-scrolling, popup-blocking and my favorite feature, I can add any search engine to the Search box (Safari only allowed Google). Other niceties include easy searching on the page (just start typing) and it doesn’t let me mistakenly close the window and all tabs when I really just wanted to close the one tab. And, for web developers, the “web developer toolbar”:http://www.chrispederick.com/work/firefox/webdeveloper/ is amazing.</p>

<p>My only complaint is that the fonts are bigger than they are on Safari, and there’s no preference to change it.</p>

        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>Last night, I wanted to try out “NewsFire”:http://www.newsfirerss.com/ but I didn’t want to go to the trouble of adding all my feeds that I read on “MyWireService”:http://mywireservice.com. It would be nice if NewsFire (or any RSS aggregator) could just work against MyWireService to get my news. Two things made this possible: 1) Gay was out for the night again volunteering for the Vashon debate team to help them in another tournament this weekend and 2) I wrote MyWireService so I can make it do anything I want. :)</p>

<p>So while I watched the end of “Gothika”:http://gothikamovie.warnerbros.com/ (ugh, terrible movie) on TiVo and had a glass of wine, I added a cool feature to MyWireService: it can now generate an RSS feed of all the updates to all the RSS feeds in each of my sections. So I can use any RSS aggregator to read my news and continues to solve “the RSS bandwidth problem”:http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1648625,00.asp. And possibly even better, I saved Gay from having to watch <em>Gothika</em>.</p>

<p>And even better, we can now do some cool stuff, and very easily, with food-related news on “Recipezaar”:http://www.recipezaar.com that we’ve been planning. Since Gay won’t be home til late tonight and it’s too wet to mow the lawn, I have my Saturday project planned. :)</p>

        <article>
          <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2245.jpg" alt="IMG_2245.jpg" />The drywall guys came today and in just 3 hours had the drywall up. It’s starting to look like an office again.</p>

<p>Yesterday we found out that the electrician is trying to charge $1200 to install the ethernet jacks. One jack install costs $300, but a phone jack costs $75 (still too high, but much more reasonable). And because we want four jacks, the cost is four times as high! It’s no more work to run one cable than 4 or 8 or 16 cables. There’s a slight amount of work per ethernet port, but even that is maybe a minute of work. Charging 25% or even 50% above the cost of installing one jack is reasonable, but 100% more per jack is outrageous. So there’s likely to be a bit of disagreement on that bill. :)</p>

<p>They can get away with this because people think computer stuff is so complex that it must be harder to install an ethernet jack. But even an idiot like me can wire an ethernet jack, it’s no more difficult than a phone jack.</p>

<p>The other scam we discovered about construction is that even on a Time &amp; Materials basis, they charge a premium on materials! So when they buy a 2x4, we are charged for the 2x4 plus 16%. The windows were even worse; we paid for the windows themselves, some unknown amount to the sales rep and then another 16% to the contractor, and the contractor didn’t do anything other than tell the rep the dimensions!</p>

<p>I was a software consultant for years and everything was T&amp;M and we <em>never</em> charged a dime for materials (software, hardware, etc.) – we charged cost. And we weren’t different, it was unheard of to charge extra for materials. The only money we made was on man-hours. When/if we do any more construction work, we’re going to be our own project manager and we’ll buy stuff directly from the distributor and cut out the middlemen.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.speakeasy.net/">Speakeasy</a> is <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/198924_speakeasy10.html">building and testing</a> a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimax">WiMax</a> network across Seattle. It’s interesting, of course, but they’re going to charge crazy prices: $650/month. Obviously, they’re gearing it to businesses, but it’s still insane. No business is going to run their network on a wireless connection just because of security concerns, so they can’t replace their internal network or their IT guy. So the only thing this replaces is their internet connectivity. But why would a business need a wireless connection – offices aren’t mobile, who cares if there’s a wire running into their office? Besides, a business can get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DS1">T-1</a> from Speakeasy themselves for $500/mo, cheaper than their WiMax offering. Or better yet, they can get a Comcast connection that is 3+ Mbps (ours is 4.5Mbps) down and 1Mbps up for $50/mo and is more reliable than a wireless connection.</p>

<p>I suspect Speakeasy will roll it out and it’ll fail and then they’ll try selling accounts to regular people for $40/mo. That’ll fail too because it’s pretty easy to get a WiFi connection in Seattle for free already.</p>
