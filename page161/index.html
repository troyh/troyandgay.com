          </h3>
            <p>After three weeks with the “Kindle”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/06/15/fathers-day-2008/, I’ve read six books. That’s a lot for me in three weeks. And I’ve probably read a seventh book considering all the samples of books I read (and decided not to buy). Overall, the Kindle is great. It creates a good reading experience and is light enough to hold for long periods of time, unlike a big hardcover book. It’s also very close to being the iPod of books. I have several books available to me, so if I decide I’d rather read another book, it’s there. So when you’re going to read, you just grab the Kindle, lay down on the hammock and then decide what you want to read.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I subscribed to several newspapers for the 14-day free trial, but I unsubscribed from all of them. They’re delivered by the time you wake up, which is nice. But they aren’t the full newspaper and most articles lack the photos or graphs that are mentioned in the article. And for the ones that are there, they’re in a 4-color grayscale, so they’re hard to see. And, the newspapers are expensive, especially considering they’re all free online (with included color photos and graphs too).</p>

<p>Here’s my annoyances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The screen’s contrast is not as good as paper. The ink in a book is black on white or slightly  yellow paper, but the Kindle is dark grey text on a light grey background. It’s still easy on the eyes for long periods of time but the lower contrast makes it harder to read in lower light. Plus, there is a slight glare on the screen so at times you do have to turn it to be able to read it, the way you would with a glossy magazine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s not very durable. The left Next Page button is already broken because I carried it in the cargo pocket of a pair of shorts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The page-turning buttons were poorly-designed. The left Next Page button is too small and the Prev Page button is too big. When holding it with my left hand, I have to either bend my thumb too far to hit the Next Page button or hold my pointer finger in front of it to make it easy to “turn” the page. The Next Page button is used 100x more than the Prev Page, why not optimize for that operation? They did do that on the right side – there is only a Next Page button there and it’s as big as the left’s Prev Page and Next Page buttons combined. But it’s angled back for some reason, so you have the disconcerting feeling of your finger sliding off of it as you press it. It makes me resist pressing it. What’s the point of that?! I assumed they wanted to make it easy to press it by reaching around the back of it, but that’s not possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The buttons are far too easy to press accidentally. When I lift it up I have to be very careful to not accidentally push a button, I find myself picking it up like I’m picking up a piece of pizza, being careful to only hold it in the right places and with enough support underneath. It’s almost impossible to pick it up with one hand without thinking about your plan of attack first.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The keyboard is unnecessarily large. There’s too much space between the keys and they’re positioned in a weird way. I assume they were trying to mimic the angled Blackberry keyboard which makes little sense. If they were going to do that, why not make it half the size like the Blackberry’s keyboard? Because the keyboard is so big, one (of the few) ways to hold the Kindle forces you to hold it with your thumb over the keys, which feels odd. Fortunately, pressing the keys does nothing while you’re reading, so you ignore the oddness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are Volume Up/Down buttons on the bottom that  you find yourself pressing when it’s resting in your hand. That’s disconcerting too. Why not put those buttons on top since, unlike a real book, you can’t hold it on the top.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s really slow. You quickly learn to hit the Next Page button when you reach the second-to-last line of the page because by the time the page actually “turns”, you’ve finished the page.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The case is necessary. For the first week-and-a-half, I didn’t use the case at all. This caused me to break one button. But that’s good, because it forced me to put the case on it. The case makes it easier to hold because you can hold it on the back without hitting the Next Page button and you can hold it at the top. You end up holding the case rather than the device itself.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

          </h3>
            <p>This is the first computer I ever bought with my salary from my first professional job. It’s a 66MHz 486 from “Gateway”:http://www.gateway.com, back when they were called “Gateway 2000” and made the best PCs. I bought it in 1992, 16 years ago and it was used every single day until three years ago. We’re doing some much-needed cleaning and I’m finally throwing it away (giving it to a PC recycle place, actually).</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I’ve used it to run DOS/Win3.1, OS/2 2.x, WinNT 3.1, 3.5 and 4.0 and, in its old age, Linux. In fact, this is the computer that got me into Linux, which was a godsend because it made my life and business a lot easier (and affordable!). Back when we started Recipezaar, we needed a computer for a mail server and it was the only other PC I had. Windows 2000 refused to install on it because it was too under-powered. Plus, I got sticker shock when I found out that a copy of Microsoft’s Exchange Server cost $5000. We couldn’t afford that to serve mail for two people even if we could afford a new computer to run it on. Having been a mail server “expert” and a Unix developer during my early career as a consultant, I knew mail servers didn’t require much. So I bought a $30 book on Linux which came with a Linux CD and had it running as a mail server in a few hours.</p>

<p>It worked great as a mail server for many months. In contrast, the (Dell) Windows 2000 server that was powering the web site (it used to only require one server!) was constantly going down and I couldn’t figure out why, even with help from the Windows support people at Microsoft – the internal people who actually know something, not the people the riff-raff talk to when they call Microsoft for help. After a few weeks of this, “Jim Allchin”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Allchin himself offered to send someone over to look at it. But by that time, I had been too impressed that the old Linux machine just kept humming along quietly serving mail without a problem. I’m one of those old school developers who appreciate performance, reliability and simplicity (not to mention Unix nerdiness), so Linux looked pretty cool to me. I figured if Linux was that stable on ancient hardware, maybe it could be a good web server too. Wasn’t Apache supposed to be a pretty good web server? If it’s good enough for Amazon and Yahoo, it’d surely be good enough for me.</p>

<p>So I installed Apache and MySQL on it, learned PHP, did some testing and we eventually decided to rebuild the web site to run on Linux. In the first year of Recipezaar’s life, it was built twice, once on Windows + SQL Server + ASP and once on Linux + MySQL + PHP. Good thing this happened early, because I doubt we’d have done that years later. Even better, the performance of Apache and MySQL was a couple of orders of magnitude faster than Windows + SQL Server, so we could run the site on much less hardware. We sold that Dell PC and bought a cheap PC to replace it to use as the web server and database server.</p>

<p>That computer was worth every penny, several times over. It’s sad to see it go.</p>

            <p>We went over to Ron &amp; Debbie’s for some drinks and dinner on their deck for the 4th. They have a great view of the Vashon fireworks in Quartermaster Harbor, but we left by 7pm to get Havana home to bed.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Wow, this is a good beer! I had my first, but hopefully not the last, “Russian Imperial Stout”:http://www.stonebrew.com/irs/ from Stone Brewing Co. Dare I say it’s even better than my favorite Russian Imperial Stout, “Old Rasputin”:http://www.northcoastbrewing.com/beer-rasputin.htm? The best way to describe this beer is that it’s like drinking a really good chocolate cake. I couldn’t get enough of it, so I’m glad it comes in a 22 oz. bottle.</p>

<p>Others agree: it’s in the “100th Percentile on RateBeer”:http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/stone-imperial-russian-stout/4315/ and was rated an A (with 1,000+ reviews) “on BeerAdvocate”:http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/147/1160/.</p>
