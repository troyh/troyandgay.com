            <p>Gay and I went to Seattle’s newest Greek restaurant, <a href="http://www.omegaouzeri.com/">Omega Ouzeri</a>. It’s from the guy who did <a href="http://www.vioscafe.com/vioscapitolhill.html">Vios</a>, a more casual Greek restaurant a couple blocks from our house. I love Greek food and Seattle has too few Greek restaurants and even fewer good ones. The food at Omega was excellent — I had a deconstructed gyro—  and reminded me that I don’t drink enough ouzo.</p>

            <p>The Seahawks lost a game they should have won. It was a depressing end to a great season.</p>

<p>I love that I can care so much about something that I know doesn’t really matter. That’s a great thing about sports. The Seahawks lost the Super Bowl in a painful way and it feels like a horrible thing for a while, but it feels great at the same time realizing that <em>real</em> life goes on unaffected… I have my health and happiness, my wife and kids are great, happy and healthy too.</p>

<p>Unbelievable game today. The Seahawks offense couldn’t do anything right for the first 56 minutes, including 5 turnovers, and it seemed like certain defeat. The defense kept it close, making key goal line stops forcing early FGs and several 3-and-outs late. Then the offense exploded to score <em>15 points in 44 seconds</em>, taking the lead 22-19. The Packers tied it at 22-22 to go to overtime where the Seahawks took 6 plays in 3 minutes 19 seconds to score the winning touchdown and win 28-22 to go to Super Bowl XLIX. This is why I watch (some) sports. </p>

<p>I watched the game two more times to convince myself it really happened. It was a fitting end to the game that Jermaine Kearse caught the winning touchdown after <em>all</em> 4 previous passes to him were intercepted. </p>

<p>The Seattle Times published these cut-outs that Dierdre &amp; Patrick brought over for the kids to make:</p>

<p>Seahawks doughnuts for breakfast is becoming a game day tradition around here:</p>
