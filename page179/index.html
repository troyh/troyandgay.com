              <p>The Steelers are one of only six teams that don’t have cheerleaders. I like that. Unfortunately, they created a mascot last year: “Steely McBeam”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steely_McBeam. And to make matters worse, he was just “arrested for drunk driving”:http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08100/871780-66.stm?cmpid=steelers.xml.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the “Beam” in his last name was inspired by “Jim Beam”:http://www.jimbeam.com/. What did they expect?</p>

He says if he’s elected he’d:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Suspend gas taxes from Memorial Day to Labor Day. That would cut “13%”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/20/in-defense-of-exxon/, or 46¢, off a gallon of gas during the summer driving season. It’s debatable whether this will work. When prices drop, people consume more. When demand rises, prices rise. If demand for gas increases, prices will rise again. People will get to take the vacation or do their jobs, which is good, but will the rise in prices offset the drop in taxes? And without gas tax revenue, will the quality of our roads decrease? Gas prices are high because OPEC artificially controls supply and Americans love to use gas. Suspending gas taxes won’t affect supply at all and may increase the love of using gas. I’d argue it’s better and safer to encourage people to fly than to drive on vacations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Raise the tax exemption for each child from $3,500 to $7,000. I spend more than $3,500/year on groceries which are not taxed in Washington State, so I get a bigger tax break from buying food than I do from providing for a kid. $7,000 is more reasonable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>End the “Alternative Minimum Tax”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_Minimum_Tax which has been hitting the middle-class in recent years even though it was originally intended to add a tax to the wealthiest households. Ending the AMT benefits wealthy people the most, but it’s a contrived tax anyway and should be ended.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cut employment tax from 35% to 25%, which is a great incentive to get companies to hire more people and be more productive (assuming they don’t hire dummies).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Best of all, he understands that “opening new markets for American goods and services is indispensable to our future prosperity” which the Democrats don’t understand. I still could never bring myself to vote for a Republican and endorse their (anti-)social ideals they are so proud of, but at least McCain has <em>some</em> good points.</p>

<p>In his “visit to the US”:http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/16/us/nationalspecial2/15cnd-pope.html?ex=1365998400&amp;en=9d9978f9f71de5d7&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss, the Pope on pedophilia:</p>

<p>bq. “I would not speak at this moment about homosexuality, but pedophilia, which is another thing. And we would absolutely exclude pedophiles from the sacred ministry.”</p>

<p>It took the Catholic Church 359 years, in 1992, to admit that Earth revolved around the sun after Galileo proved it in 1663 (when they put him on trial for blasphemy). And here we are, just 16 years after they realized that, that they recognize that homosexuality and pedophilia are two different things. If this trend towards logic continues, the Catholic Church may reconsider its stance that birth control is murder.</p>

<p>Pedophiles will no longer be tolerated in the priesthood:</p>

<p>bq. The pope said church officials were going through the seminaries that train would-be priests to make sure that those candidates have no such tendencies. “We’ll do all that is possible to have a strong discernment, because it is more important to have good priests than to have many priests,” he said.</p>

<p>They’re going to discern pedophiles from non-pedophiles. I can’t wait to find out what tests they will use to figure out who is a pedophile. If they can do that, why didn’t they figure out tests to discover who is a murderer thousands of years ago? Maybe they can discern terrorists too and we can stop taking off our shoes in airports.</p>

<p>The Pope on secularism:</p>

<p>bq. But he said the United States was interesting because it “started with positive idea of secularism.”</p>

<p>bq. “This new people was made of communities that had escaped official state purges and wanted a lay state, a secular state that opened the possibility for all confessions and all form of religious exercise,” he added. “Therefore it was a state that was intentionally secular. It was the exact opposite of state religion, but it was secular out of love for religion and for an authenticity that can only be lived freely.”</p>

<p>The Pope likes secularism that the US was founded on. Yet he is the head of Vatican City, a state within Rome that has no separation from the Church. Freedom of religion is great for everyone, except those in Vatican City.</p>

              <p>My parents live in Florida and my brother and sister-in-law, Todd and Rozanne, were going to be in Tampa for a weekend to watch  “car-racing”:http://www.acurayachtclub.com/index_flash.html so Gay and I decided to take Havana to Florida and spend a week together. We went to Bonita Beach/Bay/Springs (hey locals, pick a name!).</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>We left Sunday, April 6th at 5am to catch the 5:30am ferry to get to the airport for the 7:15am flight. Egads. Four hours to Houston and another two hours to Fort Myers, Florida, all by airplane. We drove 20 minutes in terrible humidity to the house and Todd and Rozanne arrived 30 minutes later. Grandma and Grandpa drove four hours from near Orlando on Tuesday.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> We had to remove Havana’s shoes when we went through security at the airports. A shoe bomb in her shoes wouldn’t pop a balloon.</p>

<p>We didn’t do much other than hang out in the house by the pool and watch Havana. One night we all drove down to Naples to see the town and have dinner. Florida is amazingly homogenous, but Naples is a little more interesting because they have a cute street with shops and there’s some nice older houses along the beach.</p>

<p>Mom and Dad (a.k.a., Grandma and Grandpa):</p>

<p>Havana enjoyed the pool. In Hawaii she didn’t know what to think of the pool, “in Mexico”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/02/01/mexico-vacation/ she liked to float but this time she really wanted to go into the pool. If she was put down outside she’d make a bee-line for the pool.</p>

<p>At the local grocery store I was surprised to find some good beers. They had my all-around favorite beer “Fuller’s ESB”:http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/71/219/ and “Dogfish Head”:http://www.dogfish.com/ “60 Minute IPA”:http://ratebeer.com/beer/dogfish-head-60-minute-ipa/7431/ <em>and</em> “90 Minute Imperial IPA”:http://ratebeer.com/beer/dogfish-head-90-minute-imperial-ipa/10569/, both great beers. Good beers are coming to the east coast of the US, there may be hope for humanity yet.</p>

<p>Thursday night we had a chef come to the house and make a four-course dinner for all of us. We all enjoyed that. We had jumbo lump crab cakes with a remoulade to start, a salad with bleu cheese and a balsamic reduction, a choice of Filet Mignon or Ahi tuna for the entree and a Kahlua creme brulee for dessert. I found “Schramsberg Blanc de Noirs”:http://www.schramsberg.com/blanc_de_noirs.html at a local market and I’ve wanted to try one of their champagnes since I read <em>“Napa: The Story of an American Eden”:http://www.amazon.com/Napa-Story-American-James-Conaway/dp/0618257985/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1208207729&amp;sr=8-1</em> while I was in Mexico, so we had that with our appetizers.</p>

<p>My brother was chatting with the chef and he mentioned that he gets all his recipes from the internet, so my brother mentioned that Gay and I had founded Recipezaar, which is one of his favorites, or so he said. He seemed impressed and wanted to talk to us about the site, but he made the same mistake everyone makes: assuming that we know something about cooking. ;)</p>

<p>Todd and Rozanne left Friday morning to fly home. My parents stayed with us until Sunday morning and they babysat Havana while Gay and I went out to dinner by ourselves on Saturday night.</p>

<p>It was nice to see the family (sans my sister and her family) and have Todd and Rozanne meet Havana, but for the life of me, I can’t understand why people live in Florida, my parents included. It’s sunny but I prefer less monotonous weather and scenery. Florida is devoid of scenery – if you’re lucky, you’ll see a tree, but more often than not, it is newly-planted in a parking lot. Other than the beaches, which are far less dramatic than the beaches on the west coast of the US or the Mediterranean, your eyes are not needed in Florida (and some drivers there prove it). I guess if you long for the Jimmy Buffett or Tommy Bahama fantasy lifestyles, Florida is attractive. Maybe when I’m older I’ll appreciate Florida (or Arizona) more than I do today, but I couldn’t wait to get back to the Seattle area.</p>

<p>We arrived home at 10:30pm Pacific Time last night, which felt like 1:30am to us. Havana only got a couple hours of sleep on the plane so she was very tired and went right to sleep, but she got over her jet lag and was up and perky as usual by 6:30 today.</p>

<p>There’s “more photos at Flickr”:http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/sets/72157604533896886/ and, now that Flickr has added video, there’s some videos there too. :)</p>
