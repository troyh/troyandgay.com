              <p>Since <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/04/21/pioneer-millworks/">we couldn’t use the wood from Pioneer Millworks</a>, we drove down to Tacoma this morning to visit <a href="http://www.rhinedemolition.com/">Rhine Demolition</a>, a stockpiler of reclaimed wood to look for a replacement. We quickly found some Douglas Fir planks that looked like the wood we wanted to use, but this was all very uniform, rather than the random stuff Pioneer Millworks sent. Better yet, it is reclaimed wood from the old <a href="http://www.vintageseattle.org/2007/08/07/profile-rainier-cold-storage-buildings-pt-1/">Rainier Cold Storage Stock House</a> that was <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lintmachine/2207917698/">partially demolished</a> in 2008. That building was part of the brewery built by Andrew Hemrich, the founder of Seattle Brewing &amp; Malting Company (that <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/02/18/two-breweries/">we photo’d in February</a>) and the builder and original owner of our house. Months ago, while looking in an antique shop in Georgetown, I told Gay it’d be great if we could find something from the old brewery to put in the house. We finally did. We’re also going to get some bigger pieces of wood to build our basement bar top and possibly our dining table and office desks. The history is coming full circle; I think Andrew Hemrich would be happy.</p>

<p>On our way to the house, we stopped at <a href="http://www.99bottles.net/">99 Bottles</a>, a beer store I’ve been meaning to visit for a year or two, but never find myself in Federal Way. It’s a nice shop, similar to my favorite Beer Junction in West Seattle, with a great selection and friendly owners. I got beers for the fridge and some cold beers to bring to the guys at the house for Friday beers. After a diaper change for Eva and a stop at Starbucks for a quick lunch, we trekked back up to Seattle.</p>

<p>I met a new Schuchart/Dow guy, Tim the Tool Guy (he loves old tools and buys and restores them to working condition), who was there finishing up the trim around windows. The floor sub-contractor started installing the Ipê wood in the family room this morning and were just about finished when we arrived, the sauna arrived this morning unexpectedly a week early, most of the security cameras have been installed, Gay’s closet cabinetry is mostly installed (she’s excited!), they built the woodwork around the opening between the kitchen and dining room which replicates the original woodwork and the steel frame for the wall in the attic is done and waiting for the track system to arrive and be installed next week.</p>

<p>We had beers with the guys and admired the new wood floor in the family room that just looks great. I’m really happy with how that turned out, even better than I was expecting.</p>

<p>We looked at a sample of the grout in the kitchen floor. The interior designers, when asked to select a color from two big palettes of grout colors, couldn’t find one they liked so they asked to mix two colors. And the colors are from two different grout manufacturers. The tile guys did it, but they keep telling us that it’s not a good idea to mix grout from two different manufacturers. I think they’re right, so we should pick a single color. There’s a couple colors that look just fine to me, but that’s why I’m not an interior designer, I guess.</p>

<p>Nancy and My also requested a bunch more colors for the living room. They just can’t find a color they like that brings out the color in the wood in that room. Again, I look at all those samples and am glad I don’t have to pick colors. I feel bad for the painting contractor having to keep coming back and putting yet more samples on the walls.</p>

<p>We called in dinner takeout at <a href="http://www.kokorasgreekgrill.com/">Kokoras</a>, missed the 4:40p ferry but caught the 5p ferry back home.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>Our experience with Pioneer Millworks went from bad to unworkable. While we were looking for a reclaimed wood source, they provided our contractor, Schuchart/Dow, with a sample of their reclaimed wood that everyone liked. The interior designers, NB Design Group, especially liked it for its regularity across all the pieces of wood, i.e., it wasn’t just a hodge-podge of wood thrown together. Little did they know the sample had no relation to reality.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>Our contractor and interior designers know what they’re doing. Schuchart/Dow is a respected contractor who does high-end homes and has won awards for their work. NB Design Group is a respected interior design firm who also does high-end homes and has won awards – in fact, they are who a certain extremely wealthy Seattleite uses for interior design. These are two companies with experience and knowledge about quality.</p>

<p>We originally planned to use the wood for wall cabinetry and for two doors. We decided to not use the wood for the doors, so <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/03/14/from-the-annals-of-bad-customer-service-pioneer-millworks/">we cancelled that part of the order</a>. That was the beginning of problems with Pioneer Millworks, as their salesman threatened us with a stiff fee to cancel the order (that hadn’t even shipped yet). That seemed to get resolved okay, but I’ve lived long enough to know that when a company starts off like that, making threats, no less, it only gets worse. This is no exception.</p>

<p>The wood was finally delivered to our contractor. Mark, Schuchart/Dow superintendent on our project, saw it and told us that we’d better have a look at it because it didn’t look like the sample. They took photos of it and, yes, a lot of it was not representative of the sample – it looked like a hodge-podge of wood thrown together. We asked Jim Dow, Schuchart/Dow’s founder and principal, what he thought of it. He said:</p>

<blockquote>I looked at it and it sucks......bad
I instructed Katie to track down some new samples</blockquote>

<p>We asked our interior designers what they thought, and they said:</p>

<blockquote>We agree and think it doesn't look good.  The photos look much more random in texture and color compared to the sample.</blockquote>

<p>If it were just me and Gay, two inexperienced people, we’d assume that we just don’t know enough to know that’s how reclaimed wood comes. But Schuchart/Dow and NB Design Group have decades of experience. They didn’t like it at all.</p>

<p>So I called Pioneer Millworks and talked to their General Manager, Martin Brett, on the phone. He insisted that we don’t understand what reclaimed wood is and that we just need to find someone who can finish the wood and it’ll look just like the sample – a sample he hadn’t yet seen. I asked if I could send him photos of the sample and the wood to see if he still thinks the sample is representative of the wood we received. He agreed. I sent him these photos (the first is the sample, the second is the wood we received):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5641111634/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5145/5641111634_b184d3e069.jpg" alt="photo-9" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5640540677/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5143/5640540677_bf4b368c39.jpg" alt="PastedGraphic-4" /></a></p>

<p>Anyone can see that several of the pieces look like they were taken from a Home Depot and thrown in the mix. Only half of them have the rustic saw-cuts in them. Yet 4 of the 5 pieces in the sample have them. Martin Brett couldn’t see that. He thinks it’s just a question of color.</p>

<p>He replied in email:</p>

<blockquote>Thanks for the photos, those worked well.  The sample you have looks like it has a finish on it, I can't be sure but we usually send them with either an oil or water based polyurethane.  It's a little light for oil so I'm guessing it's a poly.  The photos of the material you've received look like our  typical mix of hardwood, we can see ash, elm, and oak in there.

[links to web site photos]

I would suggest that you take a small part of the batch, give it a light wire brush (hand held) and then a light sanding.  Once you've blown the dust off put a coat of oil/poly on there and see if that meets you're desired aesthetics. Good luck.</blockquote>

<p>In other words, he couldn’t see any difference in the wood versus the sample, other than the color, yet he suggested sanding off the saw-cut look. This guy looked at the sample that shows what we wanted to get, and then concluded that we didn’t want the wood that looked like the sample, suggested we sand off all the rough wood to make it look <em>less</em> like the sample. Martin, if we wanted wood that looked like it came from Home Depot, we would have gone to Home Depot. We wanted wood that looked like old wood, like the sample shows. This guy runs a reclaimed wood retailer and, apparently, thinks the reclaimed wood look is undesirable to their customers! And classicly, adds a snotty “Good luck.” at the end as if to say “Ha ha, we have your money, good luck trying to use our product!”</p>

<p>I went back to Jim to see see if we can make the wood work for us:</p>

<blockquote>I talked to Pioneer Millworks about it and they say if it's stained, it'll look just like the sample. Do you think it can be salvaged? We feel like we're under the gun to find something else or just make the best of this wood.</blockquote>

<p>Jim answered:</p>

<blockquote>I disagree, there is way too much variation in the material, this is too important to compromise on.</blockquote>

<p>So I replied to Martin:</p>

<blockquote>If you look at those photos of 10 pieces, it's easy to pick out 3 that clearly don't match the sample and there are 1 or 2 more that are too difficult to determine. So, at least 3 and as high as 5 (30%-50%) of the 10 pieces in the photo are not representative of the sample.

We ordered 30% more than we need, which seems like plenty, but that's not nearly enough to account for the bad pieces. Your web site photos are too small to really determine if our wood is similar to your web site's photos, but we were told that the wood would look like the sample and we believed your salesman.

I find it hard to believe that it's typical for 30-50% of the wood you ship to not look at all like your sample. It sounds to me like you're telling me that it is normal and you won't try to provide wood that is representative of your sample. Is that the case?</blockquote>

<p>He replies:</p>

<blockquote>I think you're going to need to discuss this with Schuchart Dow as they specified the material and we subsequently produced your material from that specification.

Reclaimed wood is not as homogenous as 'new' material therefore samples are provided to give you an idea as to you will find within the material we ship, however they are not 'limit samples' showing the extremes of the grade. In a 12" x 12" sample we could not begin to show the variation that we see in our Settlers Plank grade.  We are very clear when we ship samples and we inform potential clients of this with each sample.

...

The two grades we have in our hardwoods are American Gothic (fully planed, no patina) and Settlers Plank (variety of patina and sawn boards).  All of our Settlers Plank is produced in New York and shipped to our standard grade.  One option would be to order additional material and then further 'cull' the boards that you feel work for your project.  However before you do that I would like to come back to something you mentioned earlier today. You indicated that you're using the material for doors/cabinets, as a result I'd expect that you're going to give the product a light to moderate sanding prior to install.   As you sand the material the patina will disappear quite quickly as the aged layer on the outside of old wood is surprisingly thin. Therefore if you're looking for a lighter patina level throughout I'd suggest you give the material a heavier sand in order to get the desired mix. Alternatively you could run the material through a onsite planer and get the same effect.  Hopefully one of those options will work for you.</blockquote>

<p>He’s trying to push this off and blame Schuchart/Dow for not understanding that the sample and the wood they provided do match and then suggests two options to fix the problem (that he says doesn’t exist): 1) keep ordering more random wood from them and hope we can get enough to use or 2) sand the reclaimed wood appearance off even more to get rid of that “aged layer on the outside”. We bought reclaimed wood specifically to get wood that looks aged, why would we want to get rid of the “aged layer”?!?</p>

<p>He even said their samples “could not begin to show the variation” in the wood. Then why provide samples at all? Or why provide samples so small that even he thinks they’re too small? He claims that what we got is very typical of what they ship, so he must know what is typical, so why don’t they make samples that show what they typically deliver?</p>

<p>The truth is that we looked at lots of samples of wood and chose this specifically because their salesman said the uniformity of the sample is what we’ll get in our order. Pioneer Millworks simply lied to Schuchart/Dow and to NB Design Group about their sample to get a sale, knowing they wouldn’t stand behind it once the wood was delivered (but they kindly offered to sell us more).</p>

<p>If Martin understood his business, he would have understood that we wanted the reclaimed look of the sample and sanding it all off was not a good suggestion. If he understood customer service, he would have offered to replace the pieces we don’t like with some that we do like. He claimed they have a warehouse in Oregon with plenty of the wood, it wouldn’t be difficult to go pick out some pieces that look closer to the sample and ship them to us. They kept telling us that this is a small order, so it wouldn’t take much wood to replace the 30% or so of the wood. He could have even suggested that we split the cost of the new wood with them for a win-win resolution: they get some profit, we don’t have to go look for a new source again and they have a happy contractor and interior designer that is likely to recommend them to future clients. Instead, Martin refused to budge, blaming the problem on his customer and our contractor and trying his best to make everyone unhappy.</p>

<p>This is a company that doesn’t stand behind it’s product, doesn’t understand or even care about what their customers want and then asks for and expects more money. They sound and act like a fly-by-night company.</p>

<p>Havana and Hudson still play with her, usually too roughly. Havana can gently put her pacifier back in her mouth when it falls out, which is handy. And Havana complains that Eva gets “all the tenshun”. Every night Hudson gives good-night kisses and always says “Eva first!”</p>

<p>I designed 2 pull-out cabinets to maximize the space I had (Gay got a much bigger closet than I did).  In the 4 feet of wall space, I could fit 12 linear feet of hanging space instead of of just 8 linear feet by turning the cabinets 90°, which requiring a pull-out hardware design. My closet has a window in it so these pull-outs also protect my clothes from the sun. The interior designers did me one better by throwing a pull-out mirror in between them! Gay says it’s really nice and I can’t wait to go see it.</p>
