              <p>Movers came this morning and moved a bunch of stuff out of the house that we’ve (mostly Gay) been packing up the last few weeks. Our listing agent, <a href="http://www.seattlefineproperties.com/about-Bob-Bennion.asp">Bob Bennion</a>, recommended them and, as expected, did a professional job. The mover is <a href="http://www.bekins.com/moving/">Bekins</a>, which we’ve learned is still a family-owned business dating back to 1891 – our agent’s name is Paul Bekins, from a long list of Bekins’ involved in the family business. You don’t see that very often.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5697311298/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5149/5697311298_9bb31e2265.jpg" alt="IMG_0962" /></a></p>

<p>Then, Megan and Lori, who work for Bob, came over to get the details on the house and for us to sign the paperwork. They also brought a photographer, Buck (drives a Mini), to take photos of the house for the listing. It should go on the market next Wednesday.</p>

<p>We’re pricing it almost 10% below where all the agents suggested we list it at to get it to sell quickly. Coincidentally, it’s the exact price the house was listed at 10 years ago when we bought it! And that was in a buyer’s market and well before the real estate bubble. So someone is going to get all the improvements we’ve done to it for a 2001-level price.</p>

              <p>Fareed Zakaria:</p>

<blockquote>But the truth is this is a huge, devastating blow to al Qaeda, which had already been crippled by the Arab Spring. It is not an exaggeration to say that this is the end of al Qaeda in any meaningful sense of the word.

...
With the death of bin Laden, the central organizing ideology that presented an existential seduction to the Muslim world and an existential threat to the Western world is damaged beyond repair. We’re left with free-lance terrorists who will, of course, be able to inflict some harm. But the Somali pirates are able to inflict harm on civilians, and that doesn’t turn them into an existential threat to the Western world.

That existential threat is gone.</blockquote>

<p>We were watching 60 Minutes when a news crawl came across the screen announcing that Obama was going to deliver an address to the nation. We quickly checked the Internet and saw the headlines that Bin Laden is dead. </p>

<p>Things I love about the story so far:
<!-- more -->
He was killed, not captured. No 5-year media circus trial. He wasn’t found dead, we went and got him. </p>

<p>No Americans were killed in the operation, which involved a fire fight. We did it perfectly – Mission Accomplished! Allah didn’t care about helping him, even on a Sunday. </p>

<p>He was killed in a mansion. He wasn’t in a cave suffering for the Muslim struggle, he was living large in a mansion. Hypocrite. </p>

<p>Obama pointed out that Bin Laden killed Muslims in his attacks: “He’s not a Muslim leader, he’s a mass-murderer of Muslims.”</p>

<p>There must be tons of evidence inside that house pointing to the other idiots in al-Qaeda. Their days are numbered. </p>

<p>One of Bin Laden’s sons was killed. Like in The Godfather, you can’t leave sons to avenge his father’s death. </p>

<p>A woman in the house was killed because she was used as a human shield by Bin Laden’s security. Assholes from beginning to end. <strong>Update:</strong> the woman was one of Bin Laden’s wives and he himself used her to shield himself from gunfire. Classy guy.</p>

It’s a bit overly-nostalgic for the “good ol’ days”, as if good childhoods are a thing of the past. </p>

<p>The Mona mentioned in the article is a teacher at the preschool we want to get Hudson into. And I can see the dome of the <a href="http://www.holynames-sea.org/">Holy Names Academy</a>, which is a beautiful building, from my office window.</p>

<p>I hope you read this years from now (and I hope I’m still around when you do):</p>

<p>Havana, I’m amazed how much you change and grow up so quickly. It seems just recently you could barely walk or talk and today you ask me to chase you around the house and you have actual conversations with me about your day. You talk a lot  about how you can’t wait to grow up and get bigger. I wish you’d grow up slower – soon, I won’t be able to carry you or lift you over my head and you won’t even want me to carry you on my shoulders or ride on my back like you’re riding an elephant.</p>

<p>You’re a great big sister to Hudson (and I’m sure you will be to Eva too), you’ve taught him a lot and, you don’t realize this and won’t believe it when you read this, but he rarely refuses you, always listens to everything you say, mimics everything you do and looks up to you. If only you could finish potty-training him because we can’t seem to.</p>

<p>Four years ago, you were a challenge that I didn’t think I could handle, and sometimes you still are today, and you prove almost daily how unprepared I am to be a dad. Nevertheless, I’m glad I’m your dad and I’ll always do what I can to help you have a happy life.</p>
