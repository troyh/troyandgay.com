          </h3>
            <p>In trying to compare server hosting companies, I tried to get an account at ServerBeach. I filled in my name, address, credit card info, etc. and submitted it. I was told it takes 24 hours to provision a server.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>That’s not surprising because they may have to go physically set up a machine and then install an OS on the machine, which takes a human, so I waited. The next day they called and, because <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/02/18/metal-in-my-eye/">I was unavailable</a>, they left a voice mail asking me to call them to confirm my credit card info. I called back the next day and the customer support person, a “Beach Buddy”, was unavailable so I left him voice mail. I didn’t hear anything for another 48 hours when I got this email:</p>

<blockquote>Hello Troy,

I apologize but since I have not heard back from you, I have denied the order and have ceased the provisioning process. If you would still like to do business with us please call 1-888-840-9091 and speak to one of our Business Development Consultants.  Thank you for your time and considering ServerBeach.

<p>WTF? He did hear from me, I left voice mail. I replied telling him that I did return his call 2 days ago:</p>

<blockquote>I returned your call on Saturday and left a voice mail, waited patiently and I never heard back. Now you just go cancel the order.</blockquote>

<p>He replied, telling me that he didn’t even listen to his voice mail before deciding I hadn’t called him back:</p>

<blockquote>Hello Troy,

I apologize, I have not been in the office today to listen to my messages.  If you do not mind, please email me a photo of your ID and Credit Card used to place the order.  We request this of you as a precaution against identity theft.  It is for your protection as well as my company's.  Thank you for your time and for your understanding.

<p>This company makes it difficult to become a customer under the guise of protecting them. It’s not true, it only protects them, not me. Credit card thieves buy real goods, they don’t steal credit cards so they can host a web site. ServerBeach does this so they don’t waste time setting up a server they may not get paid for, not to keep my identity safe. They should do it, but they should do it quickly and they shouldn’t pretend they’re doing it for anyone but themselves.</p>

<p>I tried to explain all of this to another customer support person, but he couldn’t understand what went wrong, insisting that it was because I refused to call them and provide them with the info they need. The original customer support emailed me again with the reason this problem occurred:</p>

<blockquote>I did explain that I was not in the office today and in my haste on Friday I apologize for not posting our office hours in my correspondence with you.  Something I am rectifying in my signature now for future correspondences with any client.
</blockquote>

<p>He thinks the problem was that I didn’t know his office hours, not that he didn’t check his voice mail. In other words, it’s my fault, not his.</p>

<p>If ServerBeach is this bad at handling new customers and the sales part of the business, I can’t imagine they’re very good at solving hardware and software problems for existing customers.</p>

<p>FWIW, of all the hosting companies I signed up for, only one, Rackspace, required such a double-check. But Rackspace called within 5 minutes and my account was ready to go 15 minutes after requesting it. ServerBeach waited 24 hours and then another 48 hours.</p>

<p>Eva is 2 months old today. She’s still a great baby, I can’t imagine how a baby could be easier. She only cries when she is hungry and, unless it’s taking too long, her cries are quiet. Like Hudson, she goes to sleep easily – no 45-minute struggle like Havana was. And she’s almost sleeping through the night already, often only woken up by Havana who still doesn’t always sleep through the night.</p>

            <p>While <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/02/18/two-breweries/">Gay, Eva and I went into Seattle</a>, Kelly and her nanny friend also went into Seattle to take the kids to the <a href="http://www.pacsci.org/">Pacific Science Center</a> to see dinosaurs, butterflies (“papillons”, as Havana says), etc. Hudson <em>loves</em> dinosaurs.</p>

            <p>After the <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/02/18/metal-in-my-eye/">unscheduled visit to the doctor</a>, we swung by the house to check on progress. The drywall was going up in the attic. The guest room was done and we could see some of the cross-ties through the drywall. It’s going to look great when the ceiling is all drywalled.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5457452594/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5019/5457452594_b50c1c4213.jpg" alt="IMG_3056" /></a></p>

<p>Kelly and another nanny friend took Havana and Hudson and her kids to the Pacific Science Center so we had no reason to go home. We decided to stay in Seattle for the day, so we went  down to Georgetown to see the <a href="http://www.georgetownbeer.com/">Georgetown Brewery</a>, something we’ve been meaning to do for a while because our favorite architect, Tom Kundig, did their tasting room and its outside:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/5457454430/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5253/5457454430_5ca28e10b2.jpg" alt="IMG_3058" /></a></p>

<p>They don’t sell beer except in kegs or growlers at the brewery, but they give out free samples. As Homer Simpson would say, free beer? That’s unpossible! We had a couple samples while we looked at the details of the place. We think we’re going to design our basement bar similar to what Tom did for the counter at the brewery. And our offices will be split by a moving steel wall like what they have on the outside, although not that big or rusty.</p>

<p>The Georgetown Brewery is decorated with photos of local places and I noticed that one was a photo of the Seattle Brewing and Malting Company building. I didn’t realize it was still standing. That was the brewery that the guy who built our house founded and where the famous Rainier Beer was created. After lunch at <a href="http://www.stellarpizza.com/">Stellar Pizza</a> down the street, we went down the street a little further and found the old building:</p>

<p>I love having a house that is part of Seattle (beer) history.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>For the first 15 minutes of <a href="http://troyandgay.com/2011/02/16/de-rusted-the-steel-beam/">grinding the rust off the steel beam two days ago</a>, I wasn’t wearing eye protection. I was getting some dust in my eyes so I went and found some eye protection. But I was too late. Last night, my left eye started to hurt and was bloodshot. Looking in Gay’s makeup mirror, I could see a tiny black spec stuck in my eye, fortunately not in the iris. We talked to our doctor friend about it and he said, because it’d be hard to get an opthamologist appointment on short notice, we should just go to emergency room the next day.</p>

<p>This morning, we got on the ferry to go to hospital, but while on the ferry, Gay called and got me an appointment at an opthamologist and they could get me in right away. 15 minutes after getting to the office and just a couple minutes after filling out the paperwork, the doc numbed my eye and pulled the piece of metal out with tweezers. He gave me an antibiotic prescription and I was on my way.</p>
