            <p>Stumbled upon <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/lifestyle/183613_viewmaster.html?source=rss">an article about my favorite toy turning 65</a>.  Didn’t realize they were used for training in WWII; I’d love to see what those disks look like.  I have 6 or so viewers and a couple hundred slides.  My most prized possession is a view that has an internal light so you don’t have to crane your neck to the lamp and can even look at them in the dark.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>I am program managing our wedding, so my schedule and phone now acts like a very busy person’s.  It is incredibly fun, and I am very excited.  The world will not know or appreciate the how difficult it was to iron out certain details, it will just seem “nice”.  I will know the number of phone calls and connections it took to nail down the keg and the special English tap it required in order for my fiance to have his favorite beer at his wedding or the connections dragged out for us to get a last minute dancing lesson so “our song” (whatever it turns out to be in the next 48 hours) will look natural, and the numerous small decisions about color lights and placements of paper lanterns and christmas lights to make the whole place glow…and don’t get me started on the opinionated calculus to determine the number of water bottles, tonic water and bourbon to make it through.  Right now, it doesn’t matter.  Bring on the relatives, I’m ready to wed!</p>

            <p>I installed <a href="http://isg.ee.ethz.ch/tools/postgrey/">Postgrey</a> on our mail server yesterday and, to my surprise, cut our spam down to close to zero! I used to get hundreds of spams a day, but since yesterday, I’ve received two, both from the same sender. The (Bayesian) junk mail filter on my mail client did an admirable job, but I still had plenty of spam in my inbox to annoy me. I’m amazed that such a simple mechanism like <a href="http://greylisting.org">greylisting</a> actually works.</p>

            <p><a href="http://sippey.com/b/2004/06/where-does-rss-belong.html">It’s true</a>, reading news is best done in your browser, not in an email-like application. Geeks today adopting RSS love the “email model” because they live in email, and really bad 7-pane (!) email clients like Outlook, to boot. But the masses will read news in their browser. And yes, RSS replaces the act of web browsing.</p>

            <p>You know what is scary about America? Not McDonald’s. Not Budweiser. Not that <a href="http://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2003/01/31/how_many_america.php">so few Americans have passports</a> or venture outside the US borders. Not even that Americans watch Bill O’Reilly, <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/002046.shtml">a raving idiot who distorts facts and spouts outright lies</a>. What’s scary is that Americans believe morons like Bill O’Reilly. People believe what they want to believe, the facts are nuisances.</p>
