            <p>Two Linux “inevitability” stories today. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3436289.stm">BBC</a> reports on its growing success and <a href="http://www.willametteweek.com/story.php?story=4764">Willamette Week</a> talks about the real value of Linux: <em>“It’s a question of ethical choices,” says Riverdale’s Nelson. “In a school, it’s public money. How should it be spent? Is it ethical to buy software instead of hiring an art teacher? Me, I want an art teacher–not the Microsoft help assistant dancing on every student’s desktop.</em></p>

            <p>I was into <a href="http://www.friendster.com">Friendster</a> for about an hour once.  Fun to try to look up old friends and to just see a collection of photos of current friends.  The most joy I got out of it was to find out that two of my friends knew each other completely independent of me, and that wasn’t even exciting enough to blog.  Now Google starts one of these damn sites and every one is falling all over themselves about it.  I don’t get it, but I’m not single anymore either, and these seem to be a lot like reading the “I Saw Yous” in <a href="http://www.thestranger.com">The Stranger</a>.  Though I do believe Google just throws stuff on the wall to see what sticks, I still think <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001504.html">there are some an interesting theories about it</a>, but my own take remains <a href="http://www.kottke.org/04/01/metaster">a lot less optimistic</a>.  Frankly, I can’t keep up with the friends I have, I don’t know why anyone wants more.</p>

            <p>Ben (of Ben &amp; Jerry’s) <a href="http://ww11.e-tractions.com/truemajority/oreo/landing/index.htm">explains</a> how we can fix problems in America without even denting our military defense. The most interesting part is that the US spends $40 billion on defense, but who are we defending ourselves from? Russia, our ally? They spend $7 billion. China, our most favored nation? They spend $5 billion. “Axis of Evil”? They spend less than $1 billion. Why do we spend so much on defense when we could be spending to educate our citizens? Oh… duh. Nevermind.</p>
