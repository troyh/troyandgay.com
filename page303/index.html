              <p>Just finished watching <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/CapturingtheFriedmans-1123004/">Capturing the Friedmans</a>. What a waste of 2 hours. It’s a documentary on a father and son accused of pedophilia filmed by the other son through home videos. It’s got all the hallmarks of a “wrongful-conviction-in-puritanical-America-run-by-eager-to-convict-police”, but near the end we find out that he actually is a pedophile and got away with it years before. There was a point where the son’s lawyer told him that his father, interviewing him in jail, asked to move to a different table because the 5 year old boy bouncing on his dad’s knee at the next table was “arousing him”. The moviemaker-in-denial son said to that, “What does aroused mean? If you rub up against a tree and you get aroused, that doesn’t mean you’re a pedophile. That statement [by my father] means nothing.” Yeah… if I tell you that the steak on the grill makes my mouth water and I’ve been known to eat steak in the past, there’s really no sign at all that I may not be a vegetarian.</p>

<p>And then the son goes to trial and admits to molesting children, breaking down in tears, blaming his father for causing it by molesting him and apologizing for molesting children himself. Huh?  You do this in court when you’re innocent? Which story are we to believe: The one where you stoically say you’re innocent or the one where you show emotion and admit your guilt?</p>

<p>So we’re supposed to feel sympathy for a pedophile because he <em>may</em> not have molested the children that came to his house for computer classes, although he did molest children in the past? Where’s the documentary about those children he did molest? In addition to the current MPAA rating system, we need a “Bleeding Heart Liberal, No one is ever guilty” rating so I can avoid this drivel. After seeing this movie, I can only say that I feel even more sympathy for the people who truly are innocent and wrongfully-convicted because their stories are not being heard while this unworthy movie is getting all the attention (it was <a href="http://www.oscar.com/nominees/nom_33105.html">nominated for an Oscar</a>!).</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.whitman.edu">My alma mater, Whitman College,</a> gets favorable press on The Jimmy Kimmel Show Thursday night when Ben Stein talked about just having given a speech at the “prestigious liberal arts college in Walla Walla – a real place.”  Though the only things he mentioned about the “4th Happiest Campus”: a sign of “Coming Events” (so to speak) advertising a seminar in “Female Masturbation Technique” and the campus’s celebration of “Women’s Awareness Month” marked by chalk drawings of vaginas all over the sidewalks and walls, which the students loved, but janitorial staff complained about.  Actually this is all quite indicative, especially the prestigious liberal arts college part.</p>

              <p>Martha Stewart was <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/washpost/20040306/ts_washpost/a34978_2004mar5">convicted on all four counts</a> (but <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/investing/wire/sns-ap-martha-stewart-tv,1,3592364.story?coll=sns-ap-investing-headlines">MSNBC and CNBC reported she was not guilty</a>. That’s NBC News for ya!). And <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/ap/20040306/ap_on_bi_ge/martha_stewart">CBS is dropping her television show</a>. CBS has an odd way of showing it has integrity.</p>

<p>What people don’t get about this, and this may be good, is that she was not charged with insider-trading. But that’s what everyone thinks she did. She just got a call from her broker suggesting she sell the stock, so she did. That’s legal (and wise). Her mistake was lying about it and trying to cover it up. Her experience as a stock broker probably did her in, because she probably assumed it was illegal to know what she knew. So she’s been convicted, and rightfully so, IMO.</p>

<p>But more importantly, I hope this does send a message to brokers that they have to treat all of their clients the same. Did Bacanovic have Faneuil call <em>all</em> ImClone investors at Merrill Lynch? Or all his clients? Apparently not, he just had him call Martha. That’s the crime here against American investors, IMO.</p>

              <p>We took a stack of resumés to <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/2003-10-23/chow.html">Top Pot Doughnuts</a> in Seattle yesterday morning for breakfast and reading the resumés. This is a great place, far more comfy than a Starbucks and free Wi-Fi! I don’t know what it is, but having internet access on a laptop sitting in a public place is amazing to me. And whenever you go somewhere that has free Wi-Fi, you see nothing but Mac laptops for some reason (truth be told, there was one PC laptop) even though they have a much smaller percentage of the market. Why is that?</p>
