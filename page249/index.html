          <p>We spent the day in Ubud and then took short trips to Mas and Celuk, looking for furniture, wood carvings and silver jewelry. Didn’t find anything. But we did buy a couple sarongs in Ubud’s market.</p>

          <p>It is not over freedom, it is for an Islamist superstate. It is so easy to get caught up in what happened on 9/11 and not reflect on the strategy behind it.  <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2004_09_01_juancole_archive.html#109487993311862124">This essay is some of the best analysis I’ve read on this issue</a> – though I can’t remember how I happened upon it.</p>

<p><strong>Updated 10/7:</strong> Just read the <a href="http://bostonreview.net/BR29.5/hashim.html">most amazing analysis of the insurgencies in Iraq</a>.  Unfortunately it seems our current strategy feeds the insurgency rather than calming it.  I remember hearing on TV recently that a “short insurgency” lasts 5 years….</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/03/magazine/03NONESUCH.html?oref=login">Good article about Nonesuch Records (the label of Wilco, Magnetic Fields and other favorites) in the NYTimes Magazine</a>.</p>

<p>“Nonesuch is piracy-proof,’’ the singer Emmylou Harris – who became the label’s first ‘‘adult pop’’ signing four years ago – said when I asked her to list the things that set her label apart. ‘‘Their audience actually enjoys buying a record. When I got into music in my teens, the album was a thing in itself. It was a whole piece of work that had a reason to flow the way it did. You weren’t interested in just one or two songs. Nonesuch is still in the business of supporting album artists.’’</p>

          <p>Americans across the country are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/04/politics/campaign/04vote.html?pagewanted=2&amp;hp&amp;oref=login">registering to vote in record numbers</a>. Do Americans finally realize that a different person in the White House can make a difference? It’ll be interesting to see what the actual turnout is like on November 2.</p>

          <p>After breakfast, we went into Ubud and walked up and down Monkey Forest Road and the road parallel to it. We decided not to go into the Monkey Forest today, but will one of these days. Ubud is the “cultural heart” of Bali. By that, they mean lots of art galleries and places to buy Balinese stuff. In the market I bought a cheapie (both in quality and price, $3) Bintang Beer t-shirt.</p>

<p>We don’t know why these chicks are colored this way, but there were two guys with cages like this on their bikes:

<p><em>Update:</em> We found out why the chicks are dyed colors. They sell them to children, who “like the colors”, as pets.</p>

<p>We had lunch at some place on Monkey Forest Road before returning to our car. We then went to a grocery store to get some beer and coffee to take back to the villa.</p>

<p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_1757.jpg" alt="IMG_1757.jpg" /></p>

<p>Then we decided to look for bourbon and finally found some at a huge new Walmart-like store. No Maker’s Mark, but they did have Jack Daniel’s (and a Balinese temple made out of beer cans).</p>

<p>Then we went back to the villa for a swim and to relax before dinner. We got the chef to only make a few dishes this time. Tonight we had Satay Lilit (finely-shredded chicken with shredded coconut satays), chicken in curry sauce, a green vegetable (not sure what it is), and of course, steamed rice.</p>

<p>For dessert, we had Black Rice Pudding, which I really liked:</p>

<p>Geckos crawl around the house, here’s one on the ceiling of the living room:</p>
