          </h3>
            <p>I’ve always been happy with the simplicity of Washington state’s lack of income tax, but the findings of a state committee analyzing our tax system present a different picture. We get close to half of our income from sales (and B&amp;O) tax, but the problem is “the top 1% of earners pay only around 1% of their income, while the bottom 20% of earners pay about 17% of their income to these [sales/excise] taxes.”  The committee advocates adding an income tax at ~2.6% and reducing sales tax to ~3.5%.  (Moving to a strict income tax puts the state in a vulnerable position if wages fall or jobs are lost.)</p>

<p>We don’t pay B&amp;O tax because we are a service business, but it can be quite a drag on a business that sells products.  Businesses must pay B&amp;O tax on the total amount of every product sold in the state, and it is hidden from the purchaser.  So if you assemble, say a computer, for sale, you have likely paid B&amp;O tax on every part you bought to put the thing together, and then you must B&amp;O tax again on the total when you sell it.  Thus, they also recommend replacing the cumulative B&amp;O tax with a value-added tax, where the business only pays tax on the value they add beyond part cost to final price.</p>

            <p>I lost a lot of respect for <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/60minutes/main3415.shtml">60 Minutes</a> last night when I watched their advertisement for the movie industry. I’m glad <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001472.shtml#001472">Dan Gillmor also found it to be pandering</a>. I’m sick of the RIAA claiming the music industry is dead and we’re only going to hear more about how the movie industry is dying because of internet piracy. Bear in mind that the top actors/actresses in Hollywood are paid $20-30 million for a month’s work and Hollywood execs are paid 7- or 8-figure salaries. No, they are pretending that the blue collar workers (those who make the sets for movies) are the ones being hurt. Yeah, I’m sure Jack Valenti is concerned about them. In my opinion, just like with music, if you’re making movies for the money, I don’t want your product. Make something with integrity, and that’s very inexpensive to do. Accept that some amount of piracy will always exist and you’ll still make a profit. Wal-Mart survives in spite of lots of shoplifting. Hollywood can too.</p>

<p>The 60 Minutes piece ended with a suggestion that we all go to <a href="http://movielink.com">MovieLink</a> where we can purchase movies online. Great, they’ve learned something from the RIAA’s mistakes. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work for Mac users.</p>

            <p>I love waking up in the morning to read <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=50750">this</a>:</p>

<p>_I just wanted to thank everyone at this site for helping me drop my husband’s cholestrol level by 27 points in just 5 weeks. He just had surgery for blocked arteries in his neck and is on a strict no cholestrol diet. A friend pointed me to this site and since then my husband has enjoyed many new recipes and doesn’t mind at all that they are low fat. Even found him some low fat brownies…his favorite. <em>L</em> well, thanks again folks….keep up the good work. _</p>
