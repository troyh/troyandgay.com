          <p>I just saw <a href="http://news.com.com/1601-2-5095074.html">a video</a> of Steve Ballmer, CEO of Microsoft, arguing why closed-source is better than open-source. One of his reasons was that Microsoft takes responsibility for the problems with their products to their customers and said that any customer “knows where to find him” and they can email him at steveb@microsoft.com. So I took him up on his offer and emailed him:</p>

<p>`
To: steveb@microsoft.com
Subject: Windows XP problem</p>

<p>I just watched the video of you being interviewed at the Gartner Symposium and you mentioned that you take responsibility for problems in your products (as opposed to open-source products where you say that no one is responsible) and that your customers can email you at steveb@microsoft.com. So that’s what I’m doing…</p>

<p>My Windows XP crashed this morning (it said something about an error in “0x800000EA03BC0A” or something like that) and I lost some work I was doing in Office 2000. Assuming what you said was true, can you take responsibility for this problem that one of your customers is having and fix Windows XP and/or Office 2000 so that it doesn’t crash anymore?</p>

<p>Your customer,
Troy Hakala
`</p>

<p>Let’s see if he was telling the truth.</p>

          <p>I took pictures during my bike ride this morning. Today was a great morning, it was quiet, I wasn’t too hot or cold while riding, the fresh air smelled like wintergreen, I could smell fires in chimneys burning and the sun was peaking out behind the clouds.

These were taken with the camera on my <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,2273,00.html">Nokia 3650</a> cell phone, so they’re not the greatest quality, but they’re good enough.</p>

<p>Riding south on Vashon Highway.

<p>Rounding a bend at the top of a hill on the Westside Highway.

<p>The start of climbing the biggest hill.

<p>More climbing.

<p>Reaching the top of the climb.

<p>One last hill to climb.

<p>Riding north headed back home on Vashon Highway.

<p>15 miles in 65 minutes. Yes, I’m slow, but it’s hilly.</p>

Ooh, I can’t wait. It may be geeky to be excited about a new version of an operating system, but only to those who have never used <a href="http://apple.com/macosx/">OS X</a>.</p>
