            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2349.jpg" alt="IMG_2349.jpg" />This weekend was a productive one for the office. We’ve all but finished painting. Gay did most of the painting while I did the electrical work. There’s still a bit of touch-up painting left to do, but the photo shows the progress.</p>

<p>On Friday, we went to <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/136935_frys28.html">Fry’s in Renton</a> and we got a <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/patch_panel.html">patch panel</a> and an <a href="http://www.stayonline.com/tone_probe_kits/1004.asp">electrical tone and probe kit</a>. On Saturday, I wired all 16 of the CAT5 outlets into the patch panel – easy but very tedious. Our local hardware store didn’t have the style of outlets we have in our house so we still need to get those and then I can finish the outlet wiring. That should just be an hour or so of work to complete. I haven’t been electrocuted yet, but I did blow the fuse once wiring a wall switch.</p>

<p>When it’s all said and done, I estimate we will have saved close to $700 on the electrician bill; it would have taken one electrician one full day to finish the work (~$500 in labor) and at least a couple hundred dollars in materials because they charge outrageous prices for 50¢ items like outlets and even more for CAT5 receptacles. If you go to Home Depot and buy <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/prel80/HDUS/EN_US/diy_main/pg_diy.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@0033154841.1103574459@@@@&amp;BV_EngineID=ccdgadddgigijmdcgelceffdfgidgjk.0&amp;CNTTYPE=PROD_META&amp;CNTKEY=misc/searchResults.jsp&amp;MID=9876&amp;N=2984+3004&amp;pos=n04">one CAT5 jack it’s $6</a>. I bet the electrician would have charged $15 or more for each of the 16 jacks – imagine paying $240 just for jacks! Home Depot sells them in packs of 10 for $30, so we paid $60 and we have have some left over to use elsewhere. Our cost in tools and materials: $200. And we have the tools to use in the future.</p>

<p>Savings on doing the painting ourselves? Given that we have three colors, Ron’s painting estimate of $1800 would easily have hit $3000, not unlike his other estimates. ;) Our cost in paint and supplies: $150. Ron’s $1800 estimate to paint a 400-square-foot room was insane to start, however.</p>

<p>Assuming we would have paid $3,700 for both painting and electrical work, we saved ~$3,400 by doing it ourselves. Ron’s 16% “overhead &amp; profit” tax on the work would have been an additional $600. Total savings: $4,000!</p>

<p>Next week, the carpet should get installed and we’ll be done!</p>

            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//paintcan.jpg" alt="paintcan.jpg" />Ever see a paint can like this? It’s <a href="http://prattandlambert.com/">Pratt &amp; Lambert</a>’s new design. The top doesn’t require a screwdriver or a lever to open. It has two “knobs” that stick out to give you leverage to turn it. It has two built-in handles, one on the side that you can’t see that is molded into the corner and one that bends up to mimick a traditional paint can. Both ways to carry it are far more comfortable than a traditional paint can. And the inside has a built-in drip spout – the paint that would normally drip down the side and onto your floor drips back into the container instead. And best of all, you can close it without getting paint on your hands or splattering paint like you do when you use a mallet to close a traditional paint can.</p>

<p>P&amp;L paint isn’t cheap normally, and it’s not cheap in this can either. $50 for a container 12 fluid ounces shy of a gallon. But it’s quality stuff and their colors are very nice.</p>

<p>That color in the can is the color that’s going on the walls of our office bathroom. (There’s a really bad joke but I’m too sophisticated to point it out).</p>

            <p>A <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/">Recipezaar</a> first, today we posted more photos of recipes than recipes (technically, it’s not the first time – we’ve done it on weekends when fewer recipes are posted). And we did it by a wide margin: <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/photos/bydate?date=20041213">175 new photos</a> and <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/browse/bydate/2004/12/13">100 new recipes</a>.</p>

            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2337.jpg" alt="IMG_2343.jpg" />Steve came over on Friday to help us out with colors for the office (and the rest of the house!). We still like the green (after a whole week!) so we’re sticking with that. We, or Gay &amp; Steve actually, chose a purplish/brown color called “Wild Raisin” for the window wall. The trim will be white and Steve liked our choice of carpet. We’re still figuring out the ceiling color, which can’t be white because the trim will be white.</p>

<p>We finished the second coat of green on the three walls and Gay put a coat of the Wild Raisin on the window wall. The green, by the way, is named “Olive Range”. Why are paint color names so food-oriented?</p>

            <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix//IMG_2334.jpg" alt="IMG_2334.jpg" />We painted one wall in a green that we like. We’re still not sure about what to do with the red wall. I want to paint it a darker red and Gay wants to paint the whole room the green color. Hopefully red and green won’t look like Christmas colors if we go darker red. And we’re not sure what to do about the trim; I’m leaning towards keeping it all one color.</p>

<p>Here’s the carpet we’re thinking…
