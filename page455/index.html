          <p>I love the way <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/28063.html">The Register</a> paints BillG’s recent donations. Apparently, Bill believes that fighting Linux is 12x more important than fighting HIV.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1429537">The Economist</a>: <em>Microsoft’s greatest challenge, like IBM’s before it, could be internal: how to transform itself.</em></p>

<p>I think this is true, Microsoft’s arrogant culture is way too ingrained to the company that it simply can’t be changed.</p>

<p>The Register also has an <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/54/28056.html">article</a> on Palm versus  and why (Palm believes) PocketPC will fail: <em>Manufacturers going the Microsoft way therefore have little scope for differentiation, are forced to compete on price, and will get killed. Not that many of them are doing so - while the already-anointed PC ringwraiths have moved into the PocketPC market, the handset companies have looked at the model, looked at the history books and beaten a swift retreat.</em></p>

          <p>For working so hard on the site redesign we decided to take the day off.  Spend the afternoon in the city running errands and lunch at the Elysian.</p>

<p><strong>Updated by Troy:</strong> Went to Home Depot and bought a 20’ extension ladder (for gutter-cleaning), then to Costco for the usuals. Then to Petco and the CD store where we got the new <em>Richard Ashcroft</em> and the new <em>Badly Drawn Boy</em>. Then we came home, worked a little, had dinner and finished <em>Monsters Inc</em> on DVD. I also got a bike ride in this morning, which was fun and Vashon is very fall with the leaves turning (and all over the roads).</p>

<p>I’m pretty tired tonight, and a little put-off by the negative feedback about the new site design. We’ve had lots of positive feedback, but some complaints from some. Sometimes it gets hard to work so hard on something, make no money on it and have to listen to people telling us we suck. Did we ever say we’re perfect and never make a mistake? If not, why do people feel the need to slam us?</p>

          <p>There’s just so much good news in <a href="http://www.kegel.com/linux/edu/case.html">this report</a> I don’t even know what to quote. In short, Linux is winning, starting to win or will inevitably win in every market.</p>
