              <p>Havana lost her first tooth. It’s been loose for weeks and she’s been waiting and waiting for it to come out. Until last night, when it was just barely staying in. She became so worried that she’d do what a friend did and swallow it that she was in tears. But it held on until lunch today when she bit into an apple and out it came. She was very proud of herself.</p>

<p>This jersey has turned Hudson into a football nut. The next day after getting it he woke up and got dressed in it before coming down for breakfast, which never happens. He wears it every day and begs people to play football with him all day long. </p>

<p>The games are predetermined: he tells you who you are and whether you are supposed to win or lose the game. The game is the same play over and over:  he explains where the blue line is and where the yellow line is, then he hikes the ball to you, you throw it to him and he runs away from you, while you, who instantly switched teams, are supposed to tackle him. Sometimes he gets a first down (“crossed the yellow line”) and sometimes he gets a touchdown, depending on what he decides during the play.</p>

<p>He even sleeps with the football under his pillow. Adorable.</p>

<blockquote>“Middle-aged people — like me — often look back on our teenage selves with some mixture of amusement and chagrin,” said one of the authors, Daniel T. Gilbert, a psychologist at Harvard. “What we never seem to realize is that our future selves will look back and think the very same thing about us. At every age we think we’re having the last laugh, and at every age we’re wrong.”</blockquote>

              <p>Gay and I went to <a href="http://www.fremontbrewing.com/">Fremont Brewing</a>’s new taproom for (imperial) beers this afternoon. It’s a great new taproom, much better than the old one, with several beers only available at the taproom. Dark Star Imperial Oatmeal Stout:</p>
