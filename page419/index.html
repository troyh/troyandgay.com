          <p>AOL (remember them?) is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/10/technology/10AOL.html">working on Mystro TV</a>, a competitor to TiVo. It sounds cool in some ways, but of course, being built by a media company, is designed to prevent commercial skipping, to even add more commercials (!), to prevent time-shifting for some programs, etc. It’s a guaranteed failure for those reasons alone. And I like that the big companies are finally realizing that TiVo is  a great example of <a href="http://www.wordspy.com/words/disruptivetechnology.asp">disruptive technology</a>.</p>

          <p>Spent the greater part of yesterday working on our business taxes – due March 15.  The government actually made it easier on small business this year by not requiring a lot of accounting rigamaroll.  It still cracks me up when they have to list the estimated amount of time it takes to fill out the forms and do recording keeping for them as part of the Paperwork Reduction Act – would you like a receipt for your reciept?</p>

<p>Also watched “City by the Sea” which was good.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=recipezaar&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Searching for “Recipezaar”</a> on Google has always generated about 200,000 pages in the result set. Today, it’s up to <em>6.5 million</em>! What happened?? I know that Recipezaar alone has  millions of pages (with all the ways you can browse recipes) but, to my knowledge, <a href="http://www.google.com/bot.html">Googlebot</a> has never completely finished crawling the site to index every page. Not sure that it means anything, but it’s strange that we’ve jumped so high in total indexed pages.</p>
