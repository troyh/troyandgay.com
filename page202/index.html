        <article>
          <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/Picture1.png" alt="" />The Steelers absolutely crushed the Titans today, 34-7. It started out badly, the Titans easily marched down the field on the first possession for a touchdown. I started getting bad feelings about the season. A rookie running back replacing the veterans Staley and Bettis, a second-year quarterback that finished last year poorly, a great receiver traded. But the Steelers scored on their first possession and didn’t stop scoring when they got the ball til the 4th quarter. The Titans didn’t punt either til the 4th quarter, but that’s just because they kept turning the ball over. Their offense was worthless. And this rookie running back, Willie Parker, had a great first game of his career.</p>

          <p><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/Picture6.png" alt="" /><img src="http://troyandgay.com/pix/Picture7.png" alt="" />This summer has been lacking in good new music, it’s been so bad it’s hard to even find a mediocre CD to buy. The only two good CDs I’ve heard in months are <a href="http://www.deathcabforcutie.com/">Death Cab For Cutie</a>’s <em>Plans</em> and the self-titled <a href="http://clapyourhandssayyeah.com/shows.php">Clap Your Hands Say Yeah!</a>, which was recommended by our hip New York friend, <a href="http://www.netomat.net/people/team.php">Cindy</a> (who also got us into <a href="http://www.blocparty.com/go.php?object=home">Bloc Party</a>, which was our soundtrack through France in July).</p>

<p>I liked DCFC’s <em>Transatlanticism</em>, but <em>Plans</em> is even better – not terribly innovative, just all-around good music. <em>Clap Your Hands Say Yeah!</em> is a little like Talking Heads and generally reminds me of good 80s music.</p>

          <p>This is progress, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9266986/">Michael Brown has been relieved of his responsibilities for Katrina</a>. Unfortunately, he’s still head of FEMA, so let’s hope nothing else hits the US before he “resigns”.</p>

          <p>Google has <a href="http://adsense.blogspot.com/">a blog for AdSense</a>, and I just checked it today for only the second time ever and lo and behold, they’re <a href="http://adsense.blogspot.com/2005/09/distorted-images.html">talking about image ads</a> and show a screenshot of Recipezaar. I guess they figure it’s a good demo of using Google image ads.</p>

          <p>Mayor Nagin <a href="http://www.nola.com/newslogs/tporleans/index.ssf?/mtlogs/nola_tporleans/archives/2005_09.html#077206">says the body count for Katrina may exceed 10,000!</a>. Previous to Katrina, the worst hurricane to hit the US was in <a href="http://www.ezl.com/~fireball/Disaster16.htm">Galveston, Texas in 1900</a>. It killed over 6,000 people. If Nagin’s 10,000 figure is accurate, Katrina is the worst natural disaster in the US in over a century by a <em>long</em> margin. The Red Cross has already said <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050901/NEWS0110/50901037/1260">it’s the worst disaster in their 120-year history</a>.</p>

<p>If you gave money for smaller disasters, <a href="http://redcross.org">giving</a> for this one is a no-brainer. :)</p>
