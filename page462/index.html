        <article>
          <p>On Wednesday we went to Shoreline Community College for <em>free</em> dental work. They took my blood pressure and, of course, it was high (152/67) due to my nervousness at 1) being in a medical environment and 2) having my blood pressure checked. So I’ve started taking it myself again in a more relaxed environment. It was 131/72 which is still a little high, but still normal. More weight loss and exercise should help.</p>

          <p>Idiots in Congress (some heavily funded by good ‘ol ) “decided” that <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/linux/0,1411,55989,00.html">the US Govt should not fund any software projects that result in GPL code</a>. But <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/archives/2002_10.shtml#000586">Lawrence Lessig</a> correctly explains the absurdity: <em>Giving up proprietary control is the price GPLd code demands, just as all-the-money-in-the-world is the price  would demand for similar access to its OS source. Some can pay that price; some cannot.</em></p>
