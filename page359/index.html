            <p><a href="http://video.movies.go.com/gangsofnewyork/">Gangs of New York</a> was good, but not Scorsese’s best work. The production was impressive and Daniel Day-Lewis (who left his job as a cobbler in semi-retirement from acting to make this movie) was amazing but the storytelling wasn’t as fluid or engaging as movies like <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/Goodfellas-1032176/">Goodfellas</a>. The story was confusing and seemed somewhat random but after watching a special from the Discovery Channel on the DVD, a lot of it made more sense in the history of New York. Many things were even true just shown in different orders or with different characters. But I’d have thought Scorsese would have done a better job at putting these things together into the story to make it more powerful. For example, Boss Tweed, the corrupt politician, seemed corrupt in the movie but not on the scale that he was in real life. And the gangs were far more organized in history than they seemed to be in the movie – they appeared as friends rather than organizations. And the firemen were ancillary in the movie but cornerstones of the neighborhood and the gangs in real life.</p>

<p>I feel like this movie was made more as an interesting story about NYC after 9/11 than something Scorsese really put thought into.</p>

            <p>We watched a <a href="http://www.discovery.com/">Discovery Channel</a> special on the <a href="http://video.movies.go.com/gangsofnewyork/">Gangs Of New York</a> DVD and learned that when policemen formed in NYC they were made fun of (or hated) because their uniforms looked like English policemen. So they eventually trimmed their uniforms down to just their badge on their chest that was made of copper. This is where the term “coppers” (and the shortened “cops”) came from to refer to the police.</p>

            <p>We need to look into <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001254.shtml">these options</a> for <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/VOIP">VoIP</a>. I’ve been wanting to get rid of our land lines for a long time now. TiVo and the need to call a friend of mine in Greece keeps us on a $20/mo phone line. But our TiVo is now networked and if I can get 5¢ a minute to Greece with VoIP, wow.</p>

            <p>After stopping at the bakery downtown for coffee and a muffin, we took the dogs down to Lisabeulah park on the west side of the island and Ouzo got to go swimming for his 2nd time. Illy still only wades in the water and never strays too far away from us, but Ouzo just couldn’t get enough of the water.</p>

<p>A couple kayakers from Seattle stopped for a break there too on their 2-day trip around the island (30 miles of kayaking!). As usual, they ask us what we do for a living that we can live on Vashon and everyone has the same look when we say “We run a recipe web site” and you can just see the question they’re dying to ask but never do: “And what do you do with the other 23 hours a day?”</p>

            <p>Browsing some new RSS feeds, I come across one of my favorite columns ever: The Straight Dope. And I find that my understanding of “passive-aggressive” is wrong. Cecil <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/030530.html">says</a> it applies to people who are just lazy. This makes no sense to me. I’ve always thought it meant someone who tries to get their way (acts aggressively) but does so without being overtly aggressive (passive).</p>

<p>Here’s two cases of what I would call “passive-aggressive” behavior that I’ve experienced. What are these called if not passive-aggressive?</p>

<p>1.) Our neighbor once walked up to us and asked “Do you feed your dogs? If you don’t feed them, I’d be happy to continue to feed them for you.”  She discovered that one of our dogs would eat food when offered (have you ever seen a dog say “No thanks, I’m really stuffed”?) and/or ate her cat’s food that was left outside all day.</p>

<p>2.) At a restaurant <a href="http://www.whistler-blackcomb.com/">Whistler</a> in Canada, after two shockingly bad attempts at making a <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/search/getrecipe.zsp?id=8877&amp;path=">Manhattan</a>, the waiter brought the ingredients to our table and asked Gay if she would like to make her own Manhattan.</p>
