<blockquote>For the past three weeks, the library ran a pilot program using the portable MP3 devices to store audio books downloaded from the Apple iTunes Music Store. They started with six shuffles, and now are up to a total of 10. Each device holds a single audio book.</blockquote>

<p>What a brilliant idea!</p>

            <p>We finally got our whiteboard that we ordered a couple weeks ago, also from <a href="http://anthro.com">Anthro</a>, and I assembled it today. Two-sided and on wheels. It’s perfect.</p>

<p>We can finally work on our plans…</p>

<blockquote>Gay Gilmore, who runs Seattle-based recipezaar.com, says the trick is to attract ads next to recipes beyond the main page. "The ads need to be targeted," she says, "so that when someone is reading about chicken soup, an ad for one of the ingredients is of keen interest."</blockquote>

          </h3>
            <p>After weeks of web designers complaining, Google may start to listen since <a href="http://ptech.wsj.com/archive/ptech-20050310.html">Walt Mossberg comes down on it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Still, the feature has disturbing consequences for Web site owners. In my tests, for instance, it added links to the addresses of movie theaters I had called up in a Yahoo page, and the links took me to Google Maps, not to Yahoo's own map page. When I looked up a book on eCampus, a book-selling site, AutoLink turned the ISBN numbers on the page into links to Amazon, which competes with eCampus to sell the books. When I looked up a used car for sale on AutoTrader, AutoLink turned the VIN numbers into links to Carfax, not to a competing auto-history-report seller, AutoCheck, used by AutoTrader.</blockquote>

<p>Proponents of AutoLink, including Google, argue that it’s a feature that benefits the user and/or that the user has a right to do whatever they want with content that is given to them. That’s true, but Google is the one doing this, <em>not the user</em>.</p>
