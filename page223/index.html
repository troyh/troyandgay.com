          <p><a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/">Mini-Microsoft</a> is a blog written by a Microsoft employee who, like me, believes Microsoft is bloated and ineffective.  On <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/dec04/12-16GIANTPR.asp">recent</a> <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/business/technology/10847298.htm?1c">acquisitions</a> Microsoft made to secure Windows:</p>

<blockquote>If we're the best software development house on Earth, what in earth does it mean that we can't ramp up to write great software to protect our own OS when it's under constant assault? Sure, there's some amount of fiscal responsibility in whipping out the acquisition, but didn't anyone see this slow train-wreck in progress and posit, "Hmm, perhaps we should go and write some of our own protective software?"</blockquote>

          <p>_We hate it when our friends become successful
And if they’re northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them
You bet your life
We will destroy them
If we can hurt them
Well, we may as well …
It’s really laughable
Ha ha ha</p>

<p>You see, it should’ve been me
It could’ve been me
Everybody knows
Everybody says so

          <p>Gay should be home any minute now… she left after 9am for a two-and-a-half-hour run, or 15 miles – her longest run yet. She’s in training to run the <a href="http://www.rnrmarathon.com/">San Diego marathon</a> in June. She took the iPod shuffle with her, I wonder how she liked it while running.</p>

          <p>Listening to NPR’s <a href="http://www.thislife.org/">This American Life</a> this morning, the show was about wishing you could say something different than you did at a time in your life. The best part was the 25-year old guy who, in 1992, got into a press conference with then President Bush and “heckled” him with this:</p>

<p>“The homeless in the trees mourn your environmental policy. Repent, dear King, or go to hell.”</p>

<p>Bush made a fool of the guy and today, the guy is embarrassed that his statement didn’t make the impact he thought it would, but he still believes that maybe, just maybe, Bush will wake up one day and remember what he said to him and realize he was a prophet.</p>
