            <p>I think Troy is too generous.  This movie was entirely paint-by-numbers and about an hour over what you can usually handle in an “after school special”.  I was groaning, the scenes were so heavy-handed.  I didn’t believe he was a virgin, I didn’t believe he lived on the streets, I didn’t believe whatever was supposed to have happened between Denzel and his wife that was supposed to have been fixed in the end, and I especially didn’t believe that I waited 2 hours to NOT find out one damn thing about what really happened to his parents that he was searching for.  Would he really not have demanded at least a word from the mother? Oh, and I don’t believe that kids who’s dads are SHOT by their ex-girlfriends are likely to find a black Norman Rockwell painting 20 years later.</p>

I’ve got a few mosquito bites so I’m interested right now.  I especially love it when I read that there are such things as “international itch conferences”.</p>

            <p><a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&amp;cf=info&amp;id=1808396051&amp;intl=us">Antwone Fisher</a> was not a very good movie. The acting was okay, the story ended pleasantly, but there are far better uplifting movies to see than this. I’m surprised it’s rated as highly as it is. I guess it has all the bullet points to make critics happy: child abuse, disadvantaged youth, struggle, happy ending. And that subplot between Denzel and  his wife was barely involved, yet it supposedly was critical to the movie. Seems like there was a lot of missing scenes about that.</p>

            <p>Today is the last day of the first half of the year. One of my New Year’s resolutions was to ride my bike 4 times a week and to do the “long version” of the ride half the time. Well, I should easily accomplish the 4 times a week part, but I have yet to ride the longer route this year. But I think I’m up for it strength-wise (there’s a <em>long</em> climb on it), if I could just spare the time it’ll take to do the longer route.</p>

            <p>Last week, Apple introduced <a href="http://apple.com/isight">iSight</a>. I was interested, but not seriously because I’ve tried video conferencing before and was always disappointed. But on Saturday, my niece, who lives on the other side of the country, and I got iChat audio working. We could talk over the internet (for free!) and the sound quality was amazing. So my brother and I made a deal to both get iSights so we could video conference. He ran to his local Apple store that night and got his. And we video conferenced today and the video quality is also amazing. My iSight will be here Tuesday.</p>

<p>How does Apple do it? For years, the industry languished with lousy quality. But overnight, Apple made it real.</p>
