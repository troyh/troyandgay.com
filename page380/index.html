              <p>I think Troy is too generous.  This movie was entirely paint-by-numbers and about an hour over what you can usually handle in an “after school special”.  I was groaning, the scenes were so heavy-handed.  I didn’t believe he was a virgin, I didn’t believe he lived on the streets, I didn’t believe whatever was supposed to have happened between Denzel and his wife that was supposed to have been fixed in the end, and I especially didn’t believe that I waited 2 hours to NOT find out one damn thing about what really happened to his parents that he was searching for.  Would he really not have demanded at least a word from the mother? Oh, and I don’t believe that kids who’s dads are SHOT by their ex-girlfriends are likely to find a black Norman Rockwell painting 20 years later.</p>

I’ve got a few mosquito bites so I’m interested right now.  I especially love it when I read that there are such things as “international itch conferences”.</p>
