<p>Ironically, Hatch himself <a href="http://amish.blogmosis.com/archives/012511.html#012511">appears to be guilty of a copyright violation</a> on his web site.</p>

          <p>Speaking of <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/06/001481.php#001481">Mt. St. Helens erupting</a>, the most interesting thing about Gay’s dad and aunts’ visit was when they told of their Mt. St. Helens experience in 1980. I didn’t live on the west coast in 1980, but I remember hearing about it in 6th grade. I even have a jar of ash from it that my San Francisco aunt collected from her yard. Gay’s family live in Spokane, the other side of Washington State, but they told of how the sky went black in the early afternoon and they went out on a lake with their boat anyway. The ash came down and ruined the boat’s engine. Watching the Discovery Channel show last night on the eruption, it must’ve been a terrifying event. Something nobody on the east coast of the US truly understood.</p>

<p>It’s also interesting that they expected an eruption for months – it wasn’t a surprise. 10,000 (small) earthquakes and a couple small eruptions occurrred in the days leading up to the big eruption. <a href="http://www.usgs.gov">USGS</a> was all over the area monitoring it. This bodes well for when <a href="http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/Rainier/framework.html">Mt. Rainier</a> erupts, we should have plenty of warning (I hope).</p>

          <p><img src="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/ABPub/403434356.jpg" alt="" />Watched an (okay) documentary on Mt. St. Helens last night, and then <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/135004901_volcano16m.html">this article shows up in the Seattle Times today</a> discussing Washington’s volcanic history as well.  Unfortunately when I climbed it a few years ago we were in a white-out and could not see more than 3 feet in front of us, the entire top was covered in clouds…</p>

        <article>
          <p>Finally watched <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/triplex/">XXX</a>. If you only care about action in a movie, stop here, you won’t hate it. If you want more than action in a movie, stop here, you’ll hate it. This movie is James Bond for Dummies. His name is Xander and he calls himself “X”, but the movie is called “XXX”. “XXX” is easier to remember for 14 year-olds than “007” I guess (numbers are hard).</p>

<p>As predicted, this movie is downright dumb. I could go on and on about the bad plot (world domination, duh!), the unnecessary action, the ridiculousness of driving an American muscle car through the streets of Prague, the complete lack of subtlety (they explain everything to you as if you are a moron, which you will feel like after watching this movie), the acting of Vin Diesel and everyone else, the inane dialogue that even had subtitles for the Czech characters (one of the subtitles actually was “<em>Get him fast! Kill him now!</em>”), and the pathetic one-liners (before being thrown off a plane, X asks “Where are my peanuts?”, the comedy is <em>that</em> good). And I won’t even ask why <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Name?Jackson,+Samuel+L.">Samuel Jackson</a> is in this – I’ll just try to forget that (as well as the bad scarred face he had).</p>

<p>The action isn’t even inventive. <a href="/archives/2003/06/001468.php">The Transporter</a> had much more original action scenes. They even stole the Q character from Bond, except this guy is a kid who invents the stupidest things you could imagine: a high-tech gun that is a 6-barrel revolver, missiles that launch out of the headlights in the car (a sure end to your after-dark car chase) and paintball darts filled with red paint (to simulate blood, they carefully explain to you <em>twice</em>). And of course, the ending is a (not at all subtle) tie-in to the sequel.</p>
