          </h3>
            <p>Got a most hilarious email from a Recipezaar member today.  We rejected a recipe they posted because (as they themselves stated in the description) it was an exact copy of a recipe already published on the site with a few amounts included so the nutritional analysis could be more accurate.  We, of course, don’t like having duplicate recipes because it is more work for us (duh); and, more importantly, the people that post the original recipes certainly don’t like having their recipes copied.  We have a way for anyone to submit corrections to an already posted recipe, and asked that this person submit a correction instead – that way everyone benefits.  To this they said <em>“Uhm, fuck you. I am a unix sys admin…your letter is demeaning and nasty…But whoever the dumbass is that you hired and allowed “bread” to be entered without the amount on a few sandwiches is a fucking dumbass. And most important of all, your email response to my entry is one of the most fucking insulting emails I’ve ever been sent. I’m serious….”</em>  I’d love to print the whole thing here so you can judge for yourself, but I don’t have to: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/russkiypenguin/52206.html">they posted about their “response to Recipezaar.com being a dumbass” in their blog too</a> where you can comment back to them.  And to quote this person: “All I have to say is the same thing.”</p>

            <p>Has there ever been a more annoying band than <a href="http://www.whitestripes.com/main.html">The White Stripes</a>?! This band gets no end of praise these days (which usually means they’re on their way out already…good!) but never have I heard a band’s (and I use the term “band” loosely, they don’t even have a bassist) song come on the radio that makes me mute the radio so consistently. Nails on a blackboard.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,59381,00.html">Jonathan Ive on the design</a> of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/powermac/">new PowerMac G5</a>. I’m amazed by Apple’s designs. In an industry that believes technical design is all that matters, it’s fun to have a company like Apple that pays so much attention to things that matter to humans. Apple makes you want the things they make. The rest of the industry makes you pay for things begrudgingly.</p>
