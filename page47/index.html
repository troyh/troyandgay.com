              <p>Election day is coming near
You get to pick the one you fear
Mondale, Hart or Jessie J.
They won’t stick to what they say
Sorry Ron it’s time to go
Back to acting with Bonzo</p>

<p>Who you pick, it makes no matter
We eat their shit and they get fatter
He gets to live in the White House
With his dog, his cat and spouse</p>

<p>He’ll take chauffered limos
Go cruising through the ghettos
He’ll state his mind with double think
Because his ideas really stink</p>

<p>Election day is coming near
You get to pick the one you fear
Mondale, Hart or Jessie J.
They won’t stick to what they say
Sorry Ron it’s time to go
Back to acting with Bonzo!</p>

              <p>There’s no way “The Artist” is a good movie. Black and white and silent with a lousy score. They invented color and sound because movies without them sucked. That hasn’t changed, but make a movie about how wonderful Hollywood is and Hollywood will reward you. </p>

<p>Hey Scorsese, it turns out you don’t need to put such effort into movies. Make a movie about Angelina Jolie’s struggle with anorexia if you want an Oscar.</p>

              <p>We haven’t had a date night in a while, so we went out tonight since Elysian’s 2nd beer of their <a href="http://www.washingtonbeerblog.com/elysian-brewing-preparing-for-apocalypse/">12 Beers of the Apocalypse</a> release party was also happening. We got to Elysian about 10 minutes before 6pm and there was no line but all the tables were taken. We waited 10 minutes or so and then got a table within view of the festivities, kinda. I had the Rapture Heather Ale and watched Dick Cantwell, dressed as a Pope, give his speech.</p>

<p>We decided to not have dinner at Elysian and instead walk over to <a href="http://restaurantzoe.com/">Restaurant Zoë</a>, which has just opened again after being closed for their move from Belltown to Capitol Hill. We used to go to Zoë for any special occasion before we moved to Vashon and a few times since. I’m glad to have it open again and much closer to home. The new place’s decor is less “New York” (sophisticated, contemporary) and more “west coast” (casual, rustic) and the prices are a little lower. I liked the old place, but I like the new place too, and it’s more spacious, which I prefer. The old place had a great Ahi Tuna appetizer and a hangar steak that I always ordered, but they don’t have either on the new menu. That’s too bad. We had their “Regrade Manhattan” and I had the burger, both were very good.</p>
