            <p>Running a store that customers enter during business hours is difficult.  Try running one that is open 24 hours a day, which can fill up or the doors just arbitrarily jam so no one can get in – sometimes not even you.  Oh, and it is mostly obscured what the heck is going on at a given moment.  Try as you might to work all weekend and improve “door” and “product” performance…sometimes you go through severe growing pains…and the people who visit your store (for free) will complain, but more than anything you get frustrated with yourself for not being able to fix it.</p>

            <p>A few hiccups in the new caching mechanism, but they seem to be mostly ironed out now. But I was woken up by a squawking pager at 5am, at 6am and at 7am. Fortunately, it was nothing too serious and I had my laptop on the nightstand and could deal with stuff quickly without leaving bed. By 7am, I was up and by 10am had fixed a few bugs. And it’s running really well so far.</p>

<p>Oh, and it is <em>FAST!!!</em></p>

            <p>Except for the 2 trips to the vet and late lunch break of pot stickers, Gay &amp; I have been slaving away in front of our computers working on a <em>major</em> change to Recipezaar’s caching mechanism. We feel pretty good about it at this point and are working on pushing it up to the site. Hopefully this will go well tonight, but will require lots of monitoring and nail-biting.</p>

            <p><img src="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/illy2.jpg" alt="illy2.jpg" />$250 later, Illy’s back home and is a new dog. She’ll be on <em>intestinal distress</em> food for a couple days, but otherwise, she’s perfectly healthy.</p>

            <p>Just heard from the vet. Illy’s doing “great” and we can pick her up at 4. “Great” is a lot more reassurring than “Probably not” when asked if she will die. That made Gay cry; this made her smile.</p>
