          <p>It seems like the nice days of Spring are over in Seattle. Yesterday it was pouring rain and today is not looking promising. I need to get out and ride my bike too!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Mid-afternoon it cleared up and the sun came out. Went for a 45-minute ride at 4:30. Uneventful, but it was nice to be out.</p>

          <p>Up to 9,500 on <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details?url=recipezaar.com">Alexa</a>. It’s weird how their charts go, though. Traffic steadily increases month to month but looking at their <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=recipezaar.com">chart</a>, March was way down and April is only as high as February, which is definitely not true based on our figures.</p>

          <p>We went to a friend’s house for Easter brunch. Lots of good food. And it was actually a hot morning in Seattle, must’ve been 75 degrees!</p>

          <p><a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/pacificnw/2003/0420/cover.html">Vashon Island</a>, described by activist Rita Schenck as “one-third artists, one-third environmentalists and one-third lawyers.”  I guess that makes us lawyers.  Cover story of this week’s Pacific Northwest Magazine talks about Vashon’s efforts to be self-sustaining.  There’s evena guy here who makes his own bio-diesel fuel by recycling oil from deep-fryers – “his exhaust smells like french fries” and his operations recently burnt down.</p>

          <p>We saw <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/movies/reviews/movie/1106668">Y Tu Mama Tambien</a>. It was very good, in spite of the subtitles. But don’t watch it unless you’re willing to see lots of naked people doing things with other naked people.</p>
