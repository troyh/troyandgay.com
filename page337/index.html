              <p>Walt Mossberg <a href="http://ptech.wsj.com/archive/solution-20031022.html">reviews the new music services</a>. He correctly concludes that iTunes is the best (but neglects to point out MusicMatch’s and Napster’s biggest flaw: they don’t support Macs, the platform where 70% of the legal online music-buying is done today). One feature I’d like to see in iTunes is the ability to re-download songs I’ve purchased, a feature Napster has, apparently. And they all should allow me to listen to the entire album several times before I purchase it.</p>

<p>But as impatient as I’ve been in a good download service and as amazed at how well the iTunes store works, I find that I won’t download music from iTunes either. I’d rather pay the extra $5 for a CD and get a higher-quality version, in spite of the fact that the majority of my music-listening is done on my computer or my iPod. The best feature of an online service is that I get the music immediately, but they still can’t beat the free file-sharing services on that. I routinely get music that isn’t even available yet on these services or even available on CD. And file-sharing services give me the best feature of all: I can hear an entire song/album before making my buying decision. I buy much fewer CDs I don’t like these days but buy more total CDs, and that’s good for me and for the music industry.</p>

              <p>I’ve been sitting on the couch tonight getting up-to-date on news via the web and listening to my music through TiVo on the TV. I already get the majority of my media over the internet. And while listening to KEXP over the internet, I just heard that musician <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bio.asp?oid=4239&amp;cf=4239">Elliott Smith</a> <a href="http://www.sweetadeline.net/"> died today</a> at the age of 34 of <a href="http://www.undercover.com.au/news/2003/20031022_elliottsmith.html">an apparent suicide</a>.</p>

Her father is the “family member” who was arrested. Still no word on the cause of death, but it sounds like she was injured somehow.

I didn’t even know there were apartments there (4 miles from our house).</p>

<p>Why is it so hard to keep up-to-date on a particular news story? I had to search our local newspaper’s web site to get new news. I wish I could subscribe to a story and get the updates in <a href="http://mywireservice.com">my favorite news aggregator</a>.</p>
