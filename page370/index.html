          <p>My <a href="http://apple.com/isight">iSight</a> arrived today. It’s classic great Apple packaging and most of it is well-designed. But the mounting system(s) is terrible design. To assemble/disassemble it from the mounting base, it comes apart in five pieces. It’s all designed to make it look good when it’s mounted, but surely they could’ve come up with a better design.</p>

<p>The mounting situation is horrible for anyone without a laptop. The only mount to mount it on the back of a flat panel display has a sticky base so it’s more or less permanent. Not a good idea. And the Apple displays are curved in the back no there’s no flat surface to mount the base properly. But zip ties to the rescue… I mounted it like <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dayman/isight.jpg">this guy</a> did. Not pretty, but it works until Apple or a 3rd party comes out with a better mount.</p>

<p>iChat AV is buggy still too.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/30/technology/30SECU.html">The PC industry pandering to Hollywood’s interests</a> is going to make computers your enemy, the tech industry slow to a crawl and a huge part of the US economy shrink. When only the largest companies support something, you can be sure it’s bad for consumers.</p>

          <p>I think Troy is too generous.  This movie was entirely paint-by-numbers and about an hour over what you can usually handle in an “after school special”.  I was groaning, the scenes were so heavy-handed.  I didn’t believe he was a virgin, I didn’t believe he lived on the streets, I didn’t believe whatever was supposed to have happened between Denzel and his wife that was supposed to have been fixed in the end, and I especially didn’t believe that I waited 2 hours to NOT find out one damn thing about what really happened to his parents that he was searching for.  Would he really not have demanded at least a word from the mother? Oh, and I don’t believe that kids who’s dads are SHOT by their ex-girlfriends are likely to find a black Norman Rockwell painting 20 years later.</p>
