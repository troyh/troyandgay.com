              <p>…more than I thought.  Without trying to get too excited about an announcement to come which will undoubtedly not live up to our excitement, Troy and I went from idea to application in 2 weeks with only about 5 real days of programming.  I am surprised at how much we have learned and how much fun it is to create again (instead of just fixing and tweaking).  There are only a few version 1.0s to happen in new markets.  It is exhilarating.</p>

              <p>Ok, I might be a bit of an iPod-head, but these BuyMusic.com ads are not parody, they are simply trying to confuse the market.  They look like Apple Music ads, they use the same concept, look and font.  Knowing Apple, <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-230273.html?legacy=cnet">they will undoubtedly sue</a>.  IMHO, there is a worthwhile copyright right suit here, though Apple would benefit from the ads if only their Windows version Music store were available.</p>

              <p>I accidentally saw the above headline yesterday so I was dreading every moment of yesterday’s stage as we watched it last night.  I didn’t see how the headline ended so I  know if he was losing or out of the tour or whatever.  I was on pins and needles during the descents and stomach-turning as Lance took off his helmet for the final climb.  It really was an amazing stage.  Go Lance!  …and there is a short story some where to be written about the little boy with the musette who pulled the yellow jersey off his bike.</p>

              <p>Philip Greenspun makes <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2003/07/22#a940">a good case</a> for why the SCO lawsuit against IBM (and Linux) was made possible thanks to the poor choices made by Congress and the Copyright Extension Act. I really wish the government would do what’s right for people long-term rather than what’s good for corporations in the short-term. But given that a Congressman needs to pay an expensive chef to put food on the table, that’s likely to be a pipe dream.</p>

<p>And Doc Searls has a great article on <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6989&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0">“Saving the Net”</a>. Similar to the SCO lawsuit, the internet is going to be under siege by large corporations who cry to Congress that they must maintain their right to be profitable. And Congress ignores the entire concept of Capitalism (business are born and die as part of the natural “churn” of capitalism) and help them. It’s far better to let a company like AT&amp;T die and have hundreds more born than it is to stifle hundreds so AT&amp;T continues to prosper. But that’s just my 2¢ and corporations like AT&amp;T have quite a few more pennies than I do.</p>

              <p><a href="http://buy.com">Buy.com</a>, once my favorite online store, the one with the <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_12/b3621006.htm">original crazy business model</a>, just launched <a href="http://buymusic.com">BuyMusic.com</a> today. The site is a poor rip-off of Apple’s iTunes Music Store, but the commercials (<a href="http://ak.buy.com/buy_assets/v6/buymusic/commercials/tommylee300k.wmv">1</a>, <a href="http://ak.buy.com/buy_assets/v6/buymusic/commercials/superfreak300k.wmv">2</a> &amp; <a href="http://ak.buy.com/buy_assets/v6/buymusic/commercials/rappersdelight300k.wmv">3</a>) are good rip-offs of Apple’s commercials.</p>

<p>And I guess they’re right when they say it’s music downloading “for the rest of us” because the site doesn’t work on any Mac browser I tried. Dumb. And even dumber are the more restrictive DRM restrictions on the music. But they are cheaper than Apple’s prices (79¢ versus 99¢ per song) but the selection is much smaller.</p>
