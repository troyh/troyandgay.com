            <p>Haven’t written anything for days, been busy working pretty steadily til late. But I do get my nightly Tour de France shows. <img src="/img/smile.gif" alt="" /> Also need to get ready for the <a href="http://www.vashonchamber.com/frame_visitor_StrawberryFest.htm">Strawberry Festival</a> this weekend.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/07/001554.php#001554">Unlike Gay</a>, I’ll finish <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/Barbershop-1115979/reviews.php">Barbershop</a>. But I agree it’s not funny at all. I think they watched Eddie Murphy’s <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&amp;cf=info&amp;id=1800049701&amp;intl=us">Coming To America</a> and thought it’d be a great idea to make those barbershop scenes, which were funny, into a full movie. I don’t know why people call this a “smart movie”, it was about as dumb as movies get. Every character was a stereotype, although they went out of their way to get one character to fit each black stereotype they could think of, including a white guy who acts black. And Cedric The Entertainer as the old man was embarrassingly bad… old people look different than young people in more than just a few gray hairs. And the two criminals were, you guessed it, one smart guy and his dumb sidekick in slapstick comedy. The funniest joke in the movie was when Ice Cube’s character, when compared to his father, said “Do I look like my father?” and everyone answered “Yes”. That’s how good the comedy was.</p>

            <p>I was hoping for a side-splitting comedy and didn’t laugh once.  I feel asleep and have no compunction to watch the last 20 minutes where undoubtedly the “friends all pull together to save the shop from the evil guy.”  Bad acting, bad stereotypes, and blaxploitation plot lines made this movie a real loser for me.  Ice cube was the only thing this movie had going for it.  Why on earth could they not just get a real old black man like Ossie Davis or something to play the old black guy, rather than throwing a little grey hair on Cedric the Annoying.</p>

            <p>Not that <em>the</em> soundtrack for <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/07/001550.php#001550">this movie</a> is worth purchasing, just that the movie itself would not be half as good without the sounds track that accompanies it. I really liked this film, but the music pulls together some very wacky scenes and keeps you emotionally involved with some strange charactesr and many David Lynch-style non-sequiturs that are never explained.  Adam Sandler proves himself to have a lot more depth and talent that the sweet naive guy he normally writes for himself.</p>

            <p>Troy pointed me to this <a href="">Michael Kinsley article in Slate</a>, and this is probably the most libertarian idea I’ve gotten behind in a while, but it makes a great deal of sense.  Now that <em>Lawerence v. Texas</em> gets the government out of gay sex, undoubtedly (and ironically) folks will be soon arguing to bring the government into gay marriage.  Kinsley has another solution:
<em>to end the institution of marriage. Or rather (he hastens to clarify, Dear) the solution is to end the institution of government-sanctioned marriage. Or, framed to appeal to conservatives: End the government monopoly on marriage. Wait, I’ve got it: Privatize marriage.</em>
Let people marry how they want, and let it mean nothing to the government.  Let questions of property and children be decided by commitments instead of paper.  Happens already…</p>
