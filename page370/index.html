            <p><a href="http://recipezaar.com">Our database server</a> flipped out for a few minutes last night at 11p.  Nothing like getting ready for bed and thinking you need to be getting ready to hop a ferry and go downtown to reboot a server at midnight.  Granted, living on an island makes anything, esp. late night activities, more complicated, but businesses that never close can be a real drag.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Well it has taken me til Thursday to report on the weekend.  Vashon Island’s big festival celebrates strawberries – which are no longer grown here.  We had a big barbecue Friday night with Jen, Nicki, Traci, Eric &amp; Steve that culminated in peach cobbler and a midnight game of 12 o’Clock the Ghosts are Out.  Nothing like playing hide and seek in your front yard in your thirties.  Saturday morning I ran a 10k (95th out of 110!) and Traci &amp; Eric ran the 5k.  Megan &amp; Jon, Stephanie &amp; Matt, and Mark &amp; Lee joined us on the island for the parade, one of those cute rural America sort of things (antique tractors were the best part).  We worked the beer garden for hours and rode carnival rides.  It was a really, really fun time and a tradition I hope holds.  Though the raspberries were better if you ask me.</p>

            <p>So <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/text/2003/jul/17/071708371.html">who did Tenet name</a> as the White Houser responsible for the misleading uranium claim in the State of the Union Address? My money is on either Rumsfeld or Wolfowitz. Both of those guys strike me as guys who truly believe the ends justify the means.</p>

            <p>Is the availability of MP3s today preventing music from being the soundtrack to our life? <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/17/technology/circuits/17tune.html?ex=1373860800&amp;en=eae8900c59d0728a&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">Rogier Van Bakel</a> thinks so.</p>

            <p>It’s clear that the White House was so eager for war they would do anything to justify it to the American people. And it’s terrifying to think that many people think it’s okay to go off and kill thousands of innocent (non-American) people for faked reasons. I want my government to protect me from other countries who think it’s okay to kill Americans, but now my own government is one of those “whackos” that they’re protecting us from. No wonder the US is hated worldwide. But fortunately, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/17/national/17VOIC.html?ex=1373774400&amp;en=0967d1233f195953&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">people are slooowwllly starting to question our government</a>. If Clinton was put through the ringer for lying about sex, the very least we need to do is put the Bush Administration through the ringer for lying to the entire country about sending hundreds of thousands of Americans potentially to their deaths. I have faith in the American system and I’m a natural optimist, but it’s hard to not think that the American public will get bored and move on to something else.</p>
