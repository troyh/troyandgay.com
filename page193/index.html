            <div class="post-content">
              <p>After our first long trip in the car, here’s my list of raves and complaints:</p>

<!-- more -->

<p><em>It’s incredibly comfortable.</em> The seats are comfortable and are the most configurable car seats I know of. They go up, down, forward and back, even the lower part of the seat can move fore and aft to give you a longer seating platform that can reach to the backs of your knees. It also has a lumbar control that has quite a range of movement. The ride is very smooth and quiet. And even though it’s one inch narrower than the Jeep, it has more legroom than the Jeep due to its huge transmission case between the seats.</p>

<p><em>Navigation System.</em> I have only used one other nav system extensively, and this beats it hands-down. The touch screen alone makes it much easier to use, but I’m already using voice commands to set destinations while driving, something I don’t do on the Jeep. The screen is very high-res so everything is clear and the screen is much bigger than on the Jeep. While driving, the intersection and on/off-ramps are much easier to understand. It  knows if the ramps are on the left or right and draws a picture that actually does look like the real ramp. It even knows how many lanes the highways are. It’s easy to scroll around and it tells you the distance the cursor is from you current position, so it’s easy to see how many miles you are away from a location. It’s much easier to create multiple destinations and you can select which one you want easily. It will show the miles and time to the location or the ETA of the destination. It also has a night mode so the map display changes from black print on white to white print on black, reducing the brightness in the cabin at night. I wish the Jeep had this because it can get very bright inside the cabin. This nav system is also much much faster than the Jeep’s… if you alter your route, it quickly readjusts. The Jeep’s system does “Recalculating route…” for too long.</p>

<p><em>Keyless entry.</em> Just being near the car with the key fob in your pocket is enough to get in and open the car. No fumbling around for the fob to hit the unlock button, which is especially handy when you’re carrying something. You just walk up to the car, open the door, get in and hit the Start button without ever taking your keys out of your pocket. If it’s dark out, the interior lights even fade to on when you walk up to the car. Being able to open the trunk this way is even handier because your hands are almost always full when you need to open the trunk. The trunk power closer saves your hands from getting wet grabbing the trunk lid. To lock the car, you just hit the button on the door handle, still no reason to take the key out of your pocket. Until you have a car that has true keyless entry, you won’t know how nice it is. All cars will eventually do this, I’m sure. It won’t let you lock your key in the car, so Gay’s key that she left in the car often prevented me from locking it without hitting the button on the key fob. It’s good design to prevent me from locking my key in the car, of course, but unless you pay attention you don’t know why your doors won’t lock until you realize the other key is in the car (and you curse at your wife). I imagine I’ll walk away from it thinking it’s locked when it’s not.</p>

<p><em>XM radio.</em> I prefer Sirius that we have in the Jeep because of its content (Howard Stern, NFL Radio, music channels, etc.), but XM’s reception is far superior. We rarely lost reception even on windy roads far from a large city and never lose it in the Seattle area. Sirius’ reception is very spotty in comparison. Hopefully the Sirius/XM merger will be approved and we’ll get the best of both worlds. The killer feature of XM in the car is XM NavTraffic™ which shows traffic congestion on highways. The navigation woman that speaks even tells you about the traffic, she says things like “In 20 miles, traffic is slow for 1 mile”.</p>

<p><em>Auto headlights.</em> You can put the headlights in “Auto” which turns them on when it gets dark. But it’s not sensitive enough so they don’t go on until nighttime. At dusk or in heavy rain (which we were in), you have to turn them on manually. The Jeep seems to do this better. The Jeep also has auto highbeams that turn on and off when there’s no oncoming headlights. This is the one feature of the Jeep I’ve found that the Lexus lacks.</p>

<p><em>Climate control.</em> Completely automatic. You just set the temperature and forget about it. You don’t need to turn the fan up or down at all, which is good because that requires that you navigate through the touch screen to do. You cannot hear the climate control system either, it must spin the fans up and down very slowly so you don’t hear them start.</p>

<p><em>Gutters.</em> Lexus even designed the openings well. When it’s raining and you open the trunk, water doesn’t run into the trunk from the rear window or the opened trunk door, it’s all caught in a gutter around the trunk. The same is true for the doors. All cars should do this, I hate opening a door and getting my hand or sleeve splashed with cold water.</p>

<p><em>An ash tray?!</em> I thought auto-makers did away with ash trays years ago and the lighters were now called “Power Outlets”. Not in this car, there’s two ash trays and two cigarette lighters. Who buys a $70K car and smokes in it?!? I asked the dealer about it and they claimed that Lexus took the ash tray out of a model years ago and got so many complaints that people had nowhere to put their gum wrappers. I don’t think I believe that, Lexus would have just made a trash can because 1) everything else is clearly designed for its intended purpose and 2) the ash tray does not make a good trash can.</p>

<p><em>MPG.</em> It’s rated at 16/24 city/highway (on the new 2008 EPA system, “which is different”:http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ratings2008.shtml than pre-2008) and we got 19.7 on the first tank, which was probably 50/50 city/highway driving. So the ratings are pretty accurate. I expect that to improve slightly over the next few months. This is a far cry from the 10 MPG the Jeep gets.</p>

<p><em>It’s understated.</em> This is what attracted me to it in the first place. It’s something that reviewers ding it on a lot, but those reviewers must have such low self-esteem that they need their car to “turn heads”. BMWs and Mercedes aren’t exactly flashy either compared to a Ferrari, but they do seem to stand out more than a Lexus. Frankly, I can barely tell the difference between the Lexus GS, ES or LS from the outside and that’s good, in my opinion. I prefer that the outside impresses few but the inside impresses me.</p>

<p>I love this car and love to drive it. I may turn into a car dork yet.</p>

              <p>To stretch the “new car”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/01/05/new-car-2008-lexus-ls-460/’s legs, we drove to Cannon Beach, Oregon to spend a couple days.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>We left Tuesday morning and drove for almost five hours, including ferry-waiting. The car is the most comfortable car I’ve driven ever, I didn’t even begin to get fatigued driving it, something that happens to me after about 3 hours in any other car. The seats are almost as comfortable as my Aeron desk chair and in interior is almost silent even on the highway at 80MPH. And the navigation system is much easier to use and with a higher-res screen than the Jeep Commander’s. Havana did well the entire drive too (but not on the way back).</p>

<p>We checked into “The Ocean Lodge”:http://www.theoceanlodge.com/ hotel around 3pm, relaxed for a bit watching the New Hampshire primary returns on CNN and then went out to dinner at Bill’s Tavern and Brewhouse. The food was okay, we both had fish and chips, but the beer was lousy. It’s the first brewpub I’ve been to where the house beers were undrinkable. The only beer I could get half down was their brown ale, and I don’t like brown ales, which shows how bad their other beers were. We didn’t meet the owner so he didn’t get the chance to tell us how terrible we are as parents like he did to “these people”:http://www.mytravelguide.com/restaurants/profile-46704705-United_States_Oregon_Cannon_Beach_Bills_Tavern_Brewhouse.html. But I wish we did have an encounter like that so I could tell him I’m still a better parent than he is a brewer.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, we drove down Highway 101 to the “Tillamook Cheese Factory”:http://tillamookcheese.com/VisitorsCenter/. That was a fun and scenic drive down the coastline. Tillamook is a huge business but the factory is surprisingly small. There were only a couple dozen employees there. I guess making cheese isn’t that labor-intensive. The bacteria does all the hard work, I guess (free labor!).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2181571945/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2282/2181571945_e57f0604e5.jpg" alt="IMG_1217.JPG" /></a></p>

<p>On advice from a woman at the Tillamook factory, we had lunch at “Pirate’s Cove”:http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g51877-d654438-Reviews-Pirate_s_Cove_Restaurant-Garibaldi_Oregon.html. The food wasn’t very good but  we got the funniest video yet of Havana, which made it worthwhile. Here she’s constantly waving, something we’ve been trying to teach her for weeks:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/gMG52ybkfwc">http://www.youtube.com/v/gMG52ybkfwc</a></p>

<p>Notice in the video that while it looks like she suddenly sees someone outside the window she wants to wave at, there’s nothing out there but ocean. She even does an on-demand clapping at the end. And here she is washing her food down with some milk:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/H52GfbeBhl8">http://www.youtube.com/v/H52GfbeBhl8</a></p>

<p>We drove back to Cannon Beach so Gay could do some shopping while I stayed with a sleeping Havana in the car:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2185138177/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2210/2185138177_dddeaa4a47.jpg" alt="IMG_1257.JPG" /></a></p>

<p>The car has power door-closers which are a godsend when you have a sleeping baby in the car. In the Jeep, we have to quietly close the doors but push them until they lock, but in the Lexus, you lightly close them and it quietly pulls the door closed and Havana can sleep like a baby. I wonder if Lexus thought about babies when they made this feature.</p>

<p>We had dinner that night at “The Wayfarer”:http://www.wayfarer-restaurant.com/. The time to take a baby out to restaurants in a resort town is off-season. All the places we ate were empty or near-empty, which makes it less nerve-racking when the baby decides to scream with delight while she eats. The food here was very good.</p>

<p>Thursday morning we tried to get a photo of Havana on Cannon Beach before we drove home, but it was raining so hard it wasn’t a great opportunity:</p>

<p>We drove through Astoria and right by the “Rogue Public House”:http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/13505, which is uniquely located out on a pier in the Columbia River. It was 11:30am so we kept going before realizing that the next food stop is in Kelso or Longview, not culinary destinations. So we turned around to go back to the Rogue pub.</p>

<p>We were glad we did, we had the best food of the trip there and the beers were great. Plus, having beer for me meant that Gay had to drive the rest of the way home, her first time driving the car. I had a “Kobe beef”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_beef burger with bleu cheese, Gay had a BLT and Havana had a Kobe beef hot dog, which is the best hot dog I’ve ever had. I bought three growlers of their beer to take home too: Festivus, their seasonal beer with a typical malty and sweet flavor, “Menage-a-Frog”:http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/132/34556, a Belgian style tripel (I normally don’t like Belgians, but this is delicious), and their “Brutal Bitter”:http://www.rogue.com/brews.html#brutal.</p>

<p>h2. Videos</p>

<p>The doors close themselves. Once the door is close enough, it’ll finish the job and close itself:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/uiPAzDolxnU">http://www.youtube.com/v/uiPAzDolxnU</a></p>

<p>I’m not used to it, so I still slam it shut. The trunk opens and closes itself too:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/pseiZhij50E">http://www.youtube.com/v/pseiZhij50E</a>
Accelerating up a steep hill:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/OPzJkWOednY">http://www.youtube.com/v/OPzJkWOednY</a>
It’ll do 0-60 in 5.4 seconds if someone competent is driving it and not going uphill.
There’s no key to put in the ignition, as long as the key fob is inside the car you put your foot on the brake and hit the Start button. Without your foot on the brake, it turns on only the power (or “accessories” as most cars say).Turning it off and back on:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/XfemwY7gOq4">http://www.youtube.com/v/XfemwY7gOq4</a></p>

<p>The stereo also has a DVD player in it, so you can watch movies on the nav screen if you’re not driving. If you aredriving, you only hear the audio of the DVD. This is really handy for us waiting in line and riding ferries.</p>

<p>h2. Choosing a car</p>

<p>I dreamed that if I could ever afford to, I’d walk into a BMW dealer and buy a loaded 7-series “just because I could”. It didn’t work out that way, not only did I not buy a BMW, I didn’t get the loaded model and I didn’t walk into a dealer to do it. In fact, I didn’t even want to buy a car, I’m not a car guy and I realize how financially stupid it is to buy a new car as opposed to a used car. But only having one car was making us uncomfortable when one of us has the car and the other needs a car for convenience or, yikes, an emergency – thoughts of the baby getting hurt and one of us home without a car to take her to hospital will make me do things I would normally consider to be unwise, like buying a new car.The wise financial move would be to get a Honda Accord or something equally practical (and boring) to have as a second car. But getting a car we would prefer not to drive compared to the current car that we like would mean it would sit in the garage and rarely be used so when it was needed, it would have a higher likelihood of not running. Case in point: my 1985 BMW, that is way sexier than a new Honda Accord to me, sat in the garage for years because it wasn’t as comfy as our other car, so it always had a dead battery so it couldn’t be driven when we wanted or needed to. So whatever car we got, it had to be something we’d <em>want</em> to drive. That, to me, is a luxury sedan with all the gadgets.After looking at the market for luxury sedans and deciding which cars I liked the looks of, my choices were BMW 5-series or 7-series, Mercedes-Benz E-class or S-class and the Lexus GS or LS. Making a long story short, I decided on the LS 460. I hemmed and hawed for a while about the longer LS 460 L. And I was interested in the hybrid “LS 600h L”:http://www.motortrend.com/av/roadtests/112_0703_2007_lexus_ls_600_hl_road_test/, but not at $115K and not if it doesn’t get any better gas mileage than the non-hybrid (however, it does meet the “Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle standard”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SULEV).</p>

<p>h2. How to get the best price on a new car</p>

<p>Rather than go into a dealer to negotiate, I essentially did a reverse-auction with nine Lexus dealers from Seattle to Las Vegas via fax and email. Within 24 hours, I had prices ranging from $65K to $69K on the exact car. After telling each one about the lowest price I could find, they all dropped their price to match it or got very close. The sticker price on the car is $73K and the invoice is $63K, so with little work and not having to deal with a single irritating salesperson, I had the price fairly close to invoice. I think that’s pretty good considering the LS 460 is selling extremely well. The auto industry is in a period of declining sales, down 2% over last year, but Lexus is one of the few makers that had increased sales in 2007, up 4% for 2007. Their increase is due mostly to the LS 460, which was redesigned in 2007 – “sales for the LS are up 79%”:http://thepassionatepursuit.com/2008/01/03/lexus-2007-year-end-sales-report/ from 2006, only two other Lexus models (the IS and ES) had higher sales in 2007 versus 2006. For other car makers with less positive sales, I’d expect to get a car for invoice or even less using this method.</p>

<p>I imagine I could have negotiated the price from $73K to $71K or maybe $70K at a dealer. I’d give you all the details here for free about how the car dealer industry works and how to get the best possible price yourself, but instead, I highly recommend paying “FightingChance.com”:http://fightingchance.com/ $40 for the info. That’s what I did and I paid $67K, so that $40 saved me $3000-4000 had I walked into a dealer and spent most of a day negotiating. An alternative is to use “CarBargains”:http://www.checkbook.org/auto/carbarg.cfm, which is a service that will do the same thing I did and only charge you $190. They say they take two weeks to do it, though, while I did it in a few days. Incidentally, I also tried buying it through Costco. They have an auto program that is similar to CarsDirect or other car brokers and promise to get you a good price. On this car, in just minutes on Costco’s web site and after a quick call to a dealer, I was quoted a price of $69K for a car with a $74K sticker price. CarsDirect, on the other hand, said $72K was the best price for that car. If you want a decent price really quick, Costco’s program seems to be good.</p>

<p>h2. Poor Salespeople?</p>

<p>Car dealers hate people like me. They call us “Internet people” but they don’t mean it as a compliment. Of course, they don’t like people who shops around and tries to get the lowest price, they prefer the person who walks in and pays sticker price or who feels good when they get $1000 off sticker. Dealers whine that they are in the only industry where people negotiate on price and people like me take food off their family’s table (although they don’t see the problem with taking food off my table). But they’re wrong. The car industry is the only industry where the retailer <em>expects</em> you to pay the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) and complain when you don’t want to. When you buy a TV, a coffee maker, a bicycle, a gallon of milk or anything besides a car (and an Apple product), you don’t pay MSRP, you pay a price set by competition between retailers and they don’t complain they aren’t getting MSRP.</p>

<p>Unless they’re the world’s worst or dumbest salesperson, if they agree to your price they are earning a profit, no matter how much they claim they aren’t. In fact, on all cars, dealers make a 2-3% profit when selling a car at invoice, the price they claim they paid the manufacturer to get the car. Plus, they earn bonuses if they hit sales targets, so they earn even more. 2-3% isn’t a great profit margin, but it isn’t losing money. Besides, if the old method of buying a car was not so universally hated and they moved towards a more competitive pricing model like the one I’m advocating, they’d likely sell <em>more</em> cars earning them higher incomes even with small profits.</p>

<p>The salespeople earn a commission, usually 20-25% of the profit on the car. The average salesperson sells 100-120 cars per year. If the average profit on a car is $2,000 (the profit on my purchase was over $5,000 which is low for the Lexus LS but profits are higher on luxury cars), the salesperson earns over $50,000/year, not including bonuses. Unless you earn more than that, I wouldn’t be too concerned about the welfare of your car salesperson.</p>

              <p>Every Presidential election season, some candidate tries to appeal to the lower- and middle-class voters by suggesting a simpler tax system. This time it’s Huckabee and his “FairTax proposal” where the IRS is abolished and only sales taxes are paid. But it doesn’t make sense.<!-- more --></p>

<p>He’s right that it’s really simple, but it’s a huge tax on the middle-class and a tax cut for the poorest and richest people.The President’s tax reform panel <a href="http://www.taxreformpanel.gov/final-report/TaxReform_Ch9.pdf">evaluated</a> such a plan and concluded that we’d need a Federal Sales Tax rate of 22% (on top of the current state sales tax rates!) to be a replacement for income tax. So poor people, who buy fewer things, pay less taxes, which is good. But rich people, who buy more expensive things, would have a big tax hike in sales tax, but they’d not pay income taxes, capital gains taxes, dividend taxes or estate taxes at all which would more than make up for the tax hike. So if the poor and the rich pay lower taxes, guess who pays higher taxes? Everyone else: the middle-class.</p>

<p>This chart shows where federal taxes come from today versus the sales tax plan: <img src="http://troyh.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/p_2048_1536_ef28b242-2aed-4481-b2ea-6a8b3646d5c1.jpegpix/2008/01/picture-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The left side shows what percentage of the total US tax bill is paid by each quintile (1/5th) of the population. The richest 20% of the population pays 84.2% of the total tax bill, the lower- and middle-classes pay the remaining 15.8%. But under a sales tax plan, the richest 20% would pay only 65% of the total tax bill, a tax cut, leaving everyone else to pay 35%, a tax increase.</p>

<p>Worse, the wealthier you are, the bigger the tax cut. The right side of the chart shows that the bottom 50% of the US population would have a massive tax hike, while the top 10% would get almost a 30% tax cut, a 36% tax cut for the top 5% and a 42% tax cut for the top 1%.</p>

<p>The other parts that advocates of a Federal sales tax neglect is the incentive the government is giving people with higher sales taxes. People would purchase fewer goods, so employees of companies that produce products, i.e., just about everyone, would be paid less because their employer makes less.  It also encourages a black market for goods – who wouldn’t try to buy a product and pay only 10% extra on the black market when the government is charging 22-30%?</p>

<p>Fortunately, such a tax plan would never happen since it makes no sense. But I’m sure it won’t stop Huckabee from talking about how great an idea it is.</p>
