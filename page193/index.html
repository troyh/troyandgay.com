            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>The percentage of eligible voters who do vote in US Presidential elections from 1960-2004 has averaged 55% but has decreased almost every election year (but is on the increase since a low of 49.1% in 1996).</p>

<p><img src="http://troyh.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/p_2048_1536_ef28b242-2aed-4481-b2ea-6a8b3646d5c1.jpegpix/2008/02/picture-3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Only Switzerland and Poland have lower percentages of voter turnouts than the US. Interestingly, Poland has had only two elections since 1960… I’m not surprised people jump at the chance to express their political opinion once every 20 years! Many countries even “make voting mandatory”:http://www.idea.int/vt/compulsory_voting.cfm, people can be fined, punished or even go to jail for not voting. But even that doesn’t help them achieve 100% voter turnout. Australia has mandatory voting and non-voters risk a fine of between US$275 and US$2,750 – Australia essentially pays people to vote, but only 95% of eligible voters actually voted. Among those countries where voting is voluntary, Malta (94%), Austria (92%), Italy (90%), Iceland (89%) and New Zealand (88%) make up the top five in “voter turnout percentages”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout.</p>

<p>Those who complain about a low US voter turnout cite the percentage and deem it “bad” as if a low percentage means the system isn’t working. People who want a higher percentage imply that a higher percentage of voters would be better than fewer. By this logic, a 100% turnout in a population of 10 people would be preferable to only 10% voter turnout in a population of 1,000. Obviously, it’s not the percentage of people who vote that determines a good outcome, it’s the absolute number of people who vote that determines a good outcome.</p>

<p>Comparing total voters, the top five countries with voter turnout in their most-recent elections were Malta with 377,767 voters, Austria with 7 million voters, Italy with 52 million voters, Iceland with 268,718 voters and New Zealand with 3.6 million voters. If 52 million voters in Italy, 7 million in Austria and only 300,000 people are deemed capable of making a valid choice in elections in those countries, why does the US need more voters then them? We trust a handful of people to make big decisions in our corporations that affect everyone’s finances, we trust 100 senators to make good decisions in Congress that affect how we live, we trust a few people to make decisions in running our schools, we trust a handful of people in the FDA to make proper decisions for food and drug products that are sold, but we don’t believe 122 million people is enough people to make a valid choice between two Presidential candidates?</p>

<p>In 1960, the total number of eligible voters in the US was 109 million and 63% of them voted. That’s 68 million votes. If someone in 1960 suggested that the turnout was too low, which I’m sure someone did, they’d have been ecstatic with all 109 million voters voting. So 109 million people voting would be enough people voting to ensure a good democratic system. Today we have more than that voting, so we should be able to pick a President. If that’s still not good enough, the US population continues to grow and the number of voters has always been increasing, so eventually we’ll hit the magic number of required voters, but will people <em>still</em> complain about a low voter turnout? Probably.</p>

<p><img src="http://troyh.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/p_2048_1536_ef28b242-2aed-4481-b2ea-6a8b3646d5c1.jpegpix/2008/02/picture-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Is the problem with low turnout a sign that voters are disenfranchised? Possibly, but statistically, as long as voters are a representative sample of the population, it doesn’t matter. Are US voters a representative sample of the population? There’s no way to know for sure, but if you compare the national voter turnout to each state’s turnout and find that they are close, it’s reasonable to conclude that the voters are a representative sample. In the 2000 election, “they are comparable”:http://www.eac.gov/clearinghouse/docs/voter-registration-and-turnout-2000.pdf/attachment_download/file. The lowest turnout was 43.1% (Texas) and the highest was 66.4% (Alaska) and the median voter turnout is 53%, again very close to the 51.3% national turnout in 2000. You could go even further into counties, but I suspect you’ll find the same percentages.</p>

<p>Shouldn’t we still strive for 100% voter turnout? Wouldn’t that make for a more perfect democracy? Not necessarily. The founding fathers of our country didn’t want a perfect democracy, so they created the Electoral College. But that aside, in a democracy, voters are free to voice their opinion, but they are also free to not have an opinion. By not requiring people to vote, we have a more perfect democracy than we would by restricting choice, i.e., removing the option not to vote. But even if the US had the impossible 100% voter turnout, there would be 240 million votes cast. Would 240 million people make a different decision than the decision that 122 million people made? Not likely. In fact, trying to reach 100% could be worse. The great thing about voluntary voting is that voters decide for themselves whether or not they <em>should</em> vote. The people who don’t vote don’t vote because they don’t care to vote, they know they aren’t as informed as they should be to make a decision or they don’t care enough about the outcome. Do we really want these people to vote just so we can claim a higher percentage? I don’t think so. The people who voluntarily vote are the <em>best</em> people to vote.</p>

<p>We should be happy that the other 45% <em>aren’t</em> voting and even better, that the majority of eligible voters <em>want</em> to vote. If the turnout percentage rises, we should hope that those new voters are <em>more</em> informed than the existing voters. If we blindly encourage their votes, we are encouraging a bad decision.</p>

              <p>Back from a 9-day vacation in Mexico, between Puerto Vallarta and Sayulita. “A photoset is on Flickr”:http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/sets/72157603774032038/. Our friends Jon and Megan also came down for most of the time too and Jon made great margaritas.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2225520109/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2250/2225520109_3201bf6d10.jpg" alt="IMG_1492.JPG" /></a></p>

<p>The weather was great, the food was good and I spent most of the time relaxing and reading. I finished two books and started a third which is the most productive reading I’ve ever done on a vacation.</p>

<p>One “trick” Havana does now is to smile at the camera when she’s photographed. I don’t know how she learned this, but as soon as she notices the camera pointing at her, she quickly smiles. I captured a video of her doing this, which shows how she does it only for the photo as she quickly returns to whatever she was doing before the photo:</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT6jXRUXEKg&amp;rel=1]</p>

<p>We visited the town of Bucerias for dinner and it happened to be on the final day of their town festival. The streets were crowded with food stands and there was a carnival in the town square. When we were in France in 2005, pre-baby, we stumbled on a similar festival and we watched all the kids ride the merry-go-round and all their parents taking photos of them and imagined one day we’d be those people. Here’s proof:</p>

<p>I’m glad to be back in Seattle where I can drink good beer and wine again, though.</p>

              <a class="post-link" href="/2008/01/15/my-thoughts-on-the-new-apple-products.html">My thoughts on the new Apple products</a>
            </h3>
            <div class="post-content">
              <p>“Time Capsule”:http://www.apple.com/timecapsule/ Time Machine in Leopard is worthless for laptop users unless they use their laptop exclusively as a desktop. Apple made a new Airport Extreme base station that includes a hard drive to do Time Machine backups wirelessly. I assume (and hope) it works wired too. This is a good product since you can let several machines backup to it so you don’t need to buy an external hard drive for each computer, but it still is only a halfway solution for laptop users. Apple needs to make it possible to use Time Machine online over .Mac so you get your backups wherever you are, not just at home or the office. $299 is reasonable for the 500GB version given that an Airport Extreme without a hard drive is $179. $499 seems a bit high for an additional 500GB of storage. Note that it only works with Time Machine, you can’t even use the drive as network storage.</p>

<p>“iPhone update.”:http://www.apple.com/iphone/ This is a great update. I can now add web bookmarks to the main set of icons and create several pages of icons. There’s a few web sites I check regularly on the iPhone, so this will be very handy. The Google Maps feature seems much improved with “faux GPS”. Oddly, though, it thinks I’m in Des Moines, WA when I’m on Vashon Island. I guess my cellular service is from 2 miles away across Puget Sound.</p>

<p><em>Movie Rentals.</em> The benefit of a downloadable movie rental service is that there is no physical supply problem, everyone can download the popular new movies and watch them that day. Traditional rental services never have the popular new movies available right away. So Apple’s going to take advantage of this natural benefit, right? Nope. The movies are released <em>30 days after</em> the DVD release.  This is crazy, I can get any new movie from Netflix within 30 days, usually within seven days, sometimes even the day it’s released. I’m sure this is a restriction that the studios put on Apple to protect their DVD sales, but it’s a negative for iTunes compared to Netflix. For pricing, new releases are $3.99 and $4.99 for HD quality, older movies are $2.99 and $3.99 for HD quality. These prices are a bit high compared to Netflix, depending on how many movies a month you watch. I watch about 15 movies per month and pay $35/month for Netflix, so with Netflix I pay $2.33 per movie and get 48-hour turnaround time, so Netflix is cheaper and generally more convenient than movie rentals from iTunes. And Netflix doesn’t charge higher prices for HD quality. Granted, the bandwidth required to download HD quality is much higher than standard definition so Apple has to charge more for HD, but I would expect this price difference to disappear eventually. The other gripe with the service is that you have 30 days after downloading to start the movie, which is far more than necessary, but only 24 hours to finish the movie, which is less than enough. These numbers should have been adjusted. I’ve started many movies and stopped it to watch the next night, but the 24 hour limit will prevent that, which seems pointless. Give me 48 or 72 hours to finish the movie.</p>

<p>“Apple TV.”:http://www.apple.com/appletv/ Since watching movies on your computer or iPod is not ideal, they updated Apple TV to work with iTunes to rent movies without involving a computer. This seems to be a software update only, which is good so existing Apple TV owners (are there any?) don’t have throw out their boxes. And the price is lowered to $229. The problem with Apple TV is that it’s really only useful to rent movies from Apple. It’s like a DVD player that only works with DVDs rented from Blockbuster. It’ll be interesting to see if iTunes movie rentals is a success.</p>

<p>“MacBook Air.”:http://www.apple.com/macbookair/ Ultra-portables fail in the marketplace because they’re slower and more expensive than regular laptops. They’re lighter, but once you accept that you have to carry a bunch of accessories that they couldn’t fit inside the laptop the total weight is the same and it’s less convenient to use. The MacBook Air is no different. It starts at $1799, has a 13.3” screen and weighs 3 pounds. A 15-inch MacBook Pro only costs $200 more and you get a bigger screen, a CPU that is almost 30% faster, a hard drive that is 50% bigger and is only 2 pounds (66%) heavier. Maybe that 2 pounds is significant if you only carry a laptop and no laptop bag, but once it’s in a laptop bag the 2 pounds is insignificant. And it has no ethernet port, which would make it impossible to get online at hotels that don’t have WiFi (yes, there are many still in my experience), although you can get a USB/Ethernet adapter. The battery is sealed, so the laptop lasts only as long as the battery can hold a charge. You sacrifice a lot to save 2 pounds. Besides, Apple already has the best ultra-portable: iPhone. My guess is that the MacBook Air will sell as poorly as the 12” PowerBook that Apple discontinued.</p>

<p>“Watch the keynote presentation”:http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/f27853y2/event/index.html?internal=fj2l3s9dm, they even play a Belle &amp; Sebastian song during it.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
              <p>After our first long trip in the car, here’s my list of raves and complaints:</p>

<!-- more -->

<p><em>It’s incredibly comfortable.</em> The seats are comfortable and are the most configurable car seats I know of. They go up, down, forward and back, even the lower part of the seat can move fore and aft to give you a longer seating platform that can reach to the backs of your knees. It also has a lumbar control that has quite a range of movement. The ride is very smooth and quiet. And even though it’s one inch narrower than the Jeep, it has more legroom than the Jeep due to its huge transmission case between the seats.</p>

<p><em>Navigation System.</em> I have only used one other nav system extensively, and this beats it hands-down. The touch screen alone makes it much easier to use, but I’m already using voice commands to set destinations while driving, something I don’t do on the Jeep. The screen is very high-res so everything is clear and the screen is much bigger than on the Jeep. While driving, the intersection and on/off-ramps are much easier to understand. It  knows if the ramps are on the left or right and draws a picture that actually does look like the real ramp. It even knows how many lanes the highways are. It’s easy to scroll around and it tells you the distance the cursor is from you current position, so it’s easy to see how many miles you are away from a location. It’s much easier to create multiple destinations and you can select which one you want easily. It will show the miles and time to the location or the ETA of the destination. It also has a night mode so the map display changes from black print on white to white print on black, reducing the brightness in the cabin at night. I wish the Jeep had this because it can get very bright inside the cabin. This nav system is also much much faster than the Jeep’s… if you alter your route, it quickly readjusts. The Jeep’s system does “Recalculating route…” for too long.</p>

<p><em>Keyless entry.</em> Just being near the car with the key fob in your pocket is enough to get in and open the car. No fumbling around for the fob to hit the unlock button, which is especially handy when you’re carrying something. You just walk up to the car, open the door, get in and hit the Start button without ever taking your keys out of your pocket. If it’s dark out, the interior lights even fade to on when you walk up to the car. Being able to open the trunk this way is even handier because your hands are almost always full when you need to open the trunk. The trunk power closer saves your hands from getting wet grabbing the trunk lid. To lock the car, you just hit the button on the door handle, still no reason to take the key out of your pocket. Until you have a car that has true keyless entry, you won’t know how nice it is. All cars will eventually do this, I’m sure. It won’t let you lock your key in the car, so Gay’s key that she left in the car often prevented me from locking it without hitting the button on the key fob. It’s good design to prevent me from locking my key in the car, of course, but unless you pay attention you don’t know why your doors won’t lock until you realize the other key is in the car (and you curse at your wife). I imagine I’ll walk away from it thinking it’s locked when it’s not.</p>

<p><em>XM radio.</em> I prefer Sirius that we have in the Jeep because of its content (Howard Stern, NFL Radio, music channels, etc.), but XM’s reception is far superior. We rarely lost reception even on windy roads far from a large city and never lose it in the Seattle area. Sirius’ reception is very spotty in comparison. Hopefully the Sirius/XM merger will be approved and we’ll get the best of both worlds. The killer feature of XM in the car is XM NavTraffic™ which shows traffic congestion on highways. The navigation woman that speaks even tells you about the traffic, she says things like “In 20 miles, traffic is slow for 1 mile”.</p>

<p><em>Auto headlights.</em> You can put the headlights in “Auto” which turns them on when it gets dark. But it’s not sensitive enough so they don’t go on until nighttime. At dusk or in heavy rain (which we were in), you have to turn them on manually. The Jeep seems to do this better. The Jeep also has auto highbeams that turn on and off when there’s no oncoming headlights. This is the one feature of the Jeep I’ve found that the Lexus lacks.</p>

<p><em>Climate control.</em> Completely automatic. You just set the temperature and forget about it. You don’t need to turn the fan up or down at all, which is good because that requires that you navigate through the touch screen to do. You cannot hear the climate control system either, it must spin the fans up and down very slowly so you don’t hear them start.</p>

<p><em>Gutters.</em> Lexus even designed the openings well. When it’s raining and you open the trunk, water doesn’t run into the trunk from the rear window or the opened trunk door, it’s all caught in a gutter around the trunk. The same is true for the doors. All cars should do this, I hate opening a door and getting my hand or sleeve splashed with cold water.</p>

<p><em>An ash tray?!</em> I thought auto-makers did away with ash trays years ago and the lighters were now called “Power Outlets”. Not in this car, there’s two ash trays and two cigarette lighters. Who buys a $70K car and smokes in it?!? I asked the dealer about it and they claimed that Lexus took the ash tray out of a model years ago and got so many complaints that people had nowhere to put their gum wrappers. I don’t think I believe that, Lexus would have just made a trash can because 1) everything else is clearly designed for its intended purpose and 2) the ash tray does not make a good trash can.</p>

<p><em>MPG.</em> It’s rated at 16/24 city/highway (on the new 2008 EPA system, “which is different”:http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ratings2008.shtml than pre-2008) and we got 19.7 on the first tank, which was probably 50/50 city/highway driving. So the ratings are pretty accurate. I expect that to improve slightly over the next few months. This is a far cry from the 10 MPG the Jeep gets.</p>

<p><em>It’s understated.</em> This is what attracted me to it in the first place. It’s something that reviewers ding it on a lot, but those reviewers must have such low self-esteem that they need their car to “turn heads”. BMWs and Mercedes aren’t exactly flashy either compared to a Ferrari, but they do seem to stand out more than a Lexus. Frankly, I can barely tell the difference between the Lexus GS, ES or LS from the outside and that’s good, in my opinion. I prefer that the outside impresses few but the inside impresses me.</p>

<p>I love this car and love to drive it. I may turn into a car dork yet.</p>
