          </h3>
            <p>Gay took the kids and went to Clerkenwell with Eric for the afternoon. I stayed at home and did some work for the first time on the trip, which is my form of relaxation. They walked around, took the kids to a playground and then went to dinner at another gastropub, <a href="http://www.thepeasant.co.uk/">The Peasant</a>.</p>

<p>Incidentally, it’s pronounced “Clarkenwell” in the Queen’s English. Nobody knows what you’re talking about when you say it like it’s spelled. Speaking of pronunciations, “Grosvenor” is pronounced “Grove-ner”, “Leicester” is pronounced “Ly-ster”, “Gloucester” is similarly pronounced “Gly-ster” and “Hertford” is pronounced “Hartford” (they really hate Es, I guess) – even Mark, an American, didn’t understand us when we said “Hertford”. They must not tell UK kids to “sound it out” when learning to read.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Of Gordon Ramsay’s restaurants, <a href="http://www.gordonramsay.com/murano/">Murano</a> was the only one where we could get a reservation on short notice. We knew we were coming here months ago so we really should have made reservations at his flagship restaurant (which requires a 2-month reservation) months ago. But we didn’t.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3566512780/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3642/3566512780_e99e3520c9.jpg" alt="Halibut" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>We got a babysitter and walked to Murano which is nearby. This is only the third time we’ve ever had a babysitter for the kids and the first time it was a complete stranger. The other two times it was on a personal recommendation from friends we knew we could trust who live in the city we were visiting so we were comfortable. And for this babysitter, the hotel works with a service for babysitters that does background checks and they don’t work cheaply so we were reasonably confident that they would be experienced and not a crazy person, but it was still a little uncomfortable for us to be so trusting and leave the kids with a stranger. During the hour before we left, she seemed to be very experienced with kids and Havana really took to her right away, which gave us some confidence that she really does do this for a living. Parenthood can turn you into a perpetual worrier with irrational thoughts so on our walk to the restaurant, we talked about the bad things that could happen and eventually to the worst case possibility of her taking the kids and rushing them into a waiting van to sell them on the Russian black market. But we’re trying to not be one of <em>those</em> parents and worrying doesn’t affect anything but your own state of mind, so by the time we got to the restaurant we had convinced ourselves to put it out of our minds and have a relaxing dinner.</p>

<p>We both had the <a href="http://www.gordonramsay.com/murano/menus/tastingmenu/">tasting menu</a> and it was fantastic. Each plate on a tasting menu is normally small but each of these was a good size. We also got the optional cheese plate and were full by the end of the 8 courses. I’ve been to my share of nice restaurants but I am always amazed at how perfect the dishes are – always cooked to perfection and presented beautifully. Everything we had was fantastic and the service was impeccable. An entire place setting was on the table when we sat down and was completely removed as soon as we ordered our food. What’s the point of that? We ordered a bottle of wine, it was shown to us and taken to a nearby table to be decanted, inspected over candlelight (?) and even tasted by the server. The wine was brought to our table with the bottle and the foil put back in place so that it appeared to be unopened. I’ve never seen any of that done before.</p>

<p>A total of six different people served us our dishes, removed finished plates and refilled our wine and water glasses. Normally I hate restaurants where there’s constantly someone at your table doing something, but these people knew how to be as inconspicuous as possible and never interrupted our conversation. Our reservation was at 6:30 and at 9:20 we were finished but they didn’t seem to care how long we stayed even though we were politely warned when we arrived that there was another reservation for our table at 9pm – we assumed two-and-a-half hours would be plenty of time. Nobody ever came by to ask us if we wanted our bill, they only came by to deliver a set of candies and never once looked at us while we quietly waited for the one who would bring us our bill. It never came so we eventually caught the eye of a server and asked for it.</p>

<p>We had a nice walk home through the quiet streets and light rain and best of all, found the kids at home and safe.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>Hudson’s 9 months old today. He’s starting to learn to crawl and can push himself backwards easily but not forwards. In the last few days he’s started to work on getting up on his knees but hasn’t yet figured out that he should move his knees and hands forward. He can take a few steps if you hold his hands in the air and he can stand by himself against furniture for a few minutes until he falls. He’s continuing to develop his lungs and can be very loud when he wants to be. He has successfully put food into his mouth, but still prefers that someone else do it for him. He can sit up on his own very well at this point but will often fall over, much to his surprise. Minutes after this photo was taken, he did a face-plant right into the street.</p>

            <p>We invited Mark, Lee and Eric over for dinner at our apartment. Gay made a roasted lamb with potatoes and asparagus, Lee made a mint sauce and Mark made drinks with Pimm’s. They gave Havana a book, which was very thoughtful, and Lee read it to her at the end of the evening. Mark then read one of her other new books to her as well.</p>

            <a class="post-link" href="/2009/05/24/beers-in-london.html">Beers in London</a>
          </h3>
            <p>After a week in London, I’ve found two notable things about beers here. One is good: low-alcohol beers. The other is less good: taste.</p>

<p>First, on taste, I’m disappointed in the beers here. Many years ago, if you wanted good beer you looked for a beer from Germany or England for the finest beers. That was when Anheuser-Busch, Miller and Coors ruled the beer world in the US. If you wanted a lager, you found a German beer. If you wanted ale, the UK made the best. Not anymore. America’s craft beer industry has done an amazing thing for the reputation of American beer.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Fuller’s, a UK beer, is still my all-around favorite beer in the sense that if I could only have one beer the rest of my life, it’d be a Fuller’s ESB – it’s good all year round, bitter but not too bitter, and very drinkable. And I have enjoyed an ESB in the rare times when I can find it. I’ve even come to like their London Pride which, thankfully, is readily available. I also find it interesting to drink the low-carbonated hand pump cask beers (“real ales” to purists) mostly because those are so rare in the US. I’d prefer ESB to be more carbonated but the freshness is hard to beat. But I haven’t had an English beer that I’d ask for twice since I’ve been here.</p>

<p>One notable exception to this English beer problem is a beer I found in a grocery store: Meantime London Stout. It’s still not as good as the best stouts available in America, but it’s head and shoulders above any other English beer available here, in my experience. Meantime is a brewery I’ve heard good things about while in the US and didn’t realize they were located in England. It makes sense, they’re in Greenwich, as in Greenwich Mean Time. Of course, no pub that I’ve found serves any Meantime beers.</p>

<p>Last night I had a Leffe Blonde, mostly because I’d had all the other beers at the bar. In 2005, I really liked Leffe Dark but not Leffe Blonde. Maybe I’m used to the less flavorful British beers because Leffe Blonde, a blonde ale mind you, which means it’s supposed to be lighter in flavor, was astonishingly flavorful! Leffe is Belgian, not British, though.</p>

<p>The hop levels are also very low, despite most of the beers being called “bitters”. I’d hardly call anything I’ve had here “bitter”. Even their IPAs, which are billed as having a hoppier aroma and bitter taste, are only subtly more hoppier. Frankly, I wouldn’t know an IPA from a bitter here.</p>

<p>I have been very happy to discover that beers here are so low in alcohol. Beers seem to be mostly in the low 4% range of alcohol, which is about where drek like Budweiser is, and many as low as 3.7%. Budweiser is low in alcohol because they dilute their beer with corn and rice rather than 100% malted barley, which provides less sugars for the yeast to ferment into alcohol. Budweiser does it to keep their costs low (corn and rice is cheaper than barley) and to keep flavors to a minimum (corn and rice lack the richer flavor found in barley) because most Americans prefer their beer to taste more like water than beer. In comparison, British beers have much more flavor (and color) but they somehow manage to keep the alcohol low.</p>

<p>The alcohol content is also prominently displayed on the taps. This is why Brits can drink beer at lunch and have several pints after work. London Pride, for example, has 4.1% and ESB has 5.5%. At one pub, a drunk patron started a conversation with Havana and noticed we were drinking the “very strong” ESB. I think this might be why ESB is so hard to find, people don’t want such a strong beer. In comparison, a 7% alcohol beer is what I normally drink, 9% is also common (Old Rasputin) and I start to be careful when I have a 10-13%. 18% beers like 120 Minute IPA that sometimes make me suffer at their bitterness would absolutely devastate a British beer-drinker in terms of both alcohol and hoppiness!</p>

<p>There’s a relatively new official style of beer called “session beers”. This is a beer with less than 5% alcohol and is meant to be a beer that you can have in “drinking sessions”, i.e., lots of beers right after another without getting too drunk. Most British beers classify as session beers!</p>

<p>Aside from English beers, all pubs have a selection of imports. These almost always include Kronenburg, Heineken, Stella Artois and Guinness Stout. Those are three beers I don’t even look at in the US. There’s usually a tap or three of other beers from Europe. These are all on a CO2 which is nice for a change from the less-carbonated cask beers.</p>
