          <p>“FeedFlix.com”:http://feedflix.com analyzes your Netflix history and generates a report. Our report:</p>

<blockquote>You have been a Netflix member since February 2002 and have returned 748 titles to date
You most recently returned a movie on 07/Apr/09 i.e. about 19 hours ago
You keep titles at home for an average of 12 days
You see 15.7 titles by DVD and 5.7 titles by Instant Watch each month
Your cost/DVD rental is $0.89. Your cost/movie (including Instant Watch) is $0.66
You're in the 19th percentile. i.e., 19% of FeedFlixers pay less than you per movie</blockquote>

<p>According to that, we pay 66¢ per movie that we watch which makes Netflix quite a good deal for us! The math doesn’t seem to work out for me, though. Most of the 7 years we’ve been a Netflix member we were on the $20/month plan. We suspended our account for about 18 months (tried out Blockbuster’s competitor) and a year ago we upgraded to the $36/mo plan. So we’ve spent about $1,500 on Netflix over the last 7 years. Watching 748 movies (that’s 11 movies/month on average), that’s $2.02/movie by my math. Still a good deal compared to a local video rental store (and far more convenient) but not as good as FeedFlix suggests.</p>

<p>I found out about this site from Leo Laporte who discovered that <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/1e481452-14c0-012e-6135-59f0bced8d51/OMG-According-to-Feedflix-I-m-spending-92-97-per/">he spends $92 per movie</a>. He could buy the DVD of every movie he watches and cut his movie bill by 75%.</p>

          <p>While in Portland, we picked up several beers from “The Bruery”:http://www.thebruery.com/. I’d never had their beers before but I am very impressed. I have taken a liking to Belgian beers which surprises me because I’ve never cared for them much before. I guess I’ve never had a good one; or my tastes are changing in my old age.</p>

<p>Gay and I shared this on Saturday evening after I spent all day in the sun washing both cars. It may have just been that I was tired and wanting to sit down and relax and this beer happened to be a perfect fit, but this was one of the best beer experiences I’ve had in a long time – it was a light and refreshing beer.</p>

          <p>We checked out of the hotel in Portland and were on the road home by 10am. We stopped in Dupont, WA for lunch and took the 3pm ferry back to Vashon. A total of 1800 miles of driving, which was 700 less than “last year’s drive to California”:http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/08/seattle-to-eugene-or/.</p>

          <p>On Tuesday we went to the “Lucky Labrador”:http://www.luckylab.com/html/story.html brewpub, which we’ve never been to before but had heard good things about (and because we love labradors). Havana slept through most of lunch. Lucky Lab has a very aloof group of employees who don’t seem to care if you order anything or not and is even dog-friendly. There are lots of photos and painting of labradors, all looked just like Illy and Ouzo.</p>

<p>We then stopped at “John’s Marketplace”:http://www.johnsmarketplace.com/. I’d heard about this place from “a Seattle beer blogger”:http://seattlebeernews.com/?p=96 and he’s right, I’ve never seen a bigger or better beer selection.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3407017059/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3349/3407017059_bed89ddd67.jpg" alt="John's Marketplace" /></a></p>

<p>We found tons of beers we’ve never heard of and many that we have heard of but can’t get in Seattle. Minutes after we got there and I was looking at the beers in the first aisle I heard a loud pop and an immediate announcement on the PA: “Broken bottle on aisle one!” Hudson had pulled a bottle off the shelf and, unfazed, was reaching for another. They were very nice about it and didn’t charge us for it. We left with 29 bottles, mostly 650ml, of beers to take home.</p>

<p>We walked around the little area there called “Multnomah Village”:http://www.multnomahvillage.org/joomla/ and found a kid’s toy shop (on Troy Street!) where Havana immediately found “choo choos” (a wooden train set) and played with that while Gay found a couple toys for her. Then we found a kids clothes shop and Gay got her a new shirt. We left that area and drove around the outskirts of Portland before going back to the hotel for dinner at the rooftop restaurant “Departure”:http://www.starwoodhotels.com/luxury/property/dining/index.html?propertyID=1757.</p>

<p>Dinner was stressful with the kids. We didn’t get there until after 6:30pm and they weren’t in the mood to sit still. Fortunately, they stuck us in a corner and the place was pretty loud so they weren’t disruptive to anyone but us. I ate most of my dinner with Havana on my lap and Gay was entertaining Hudson on the bench seat. The food was very good, though.</p>
