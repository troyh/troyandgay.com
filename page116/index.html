          </h3>
            <p>Last time we were in London in 2005 we walked by the <a href="http://www.ba-londoneye.com/">London Eye</a> and the line was crazy long so we decided not to wait. This time we planned ahead and bought tickets online where you can get “fast-track” tickets so you don’t have to wait in line (not to mention a 20% discount!).</p>

<p>The downside is that you have to schedule your “flight” – it’s a British Airways sponsored attraction, so they call trips on it “flights” and the announcements refer to takeoffs and landings. Cute. Scheduling anything when you have kids is difficult, especially when you are planning to walk a route you haven’t yet walked. We gave ourselves plenty of time and scheduled it for 5:30pm thinking that’d be plenty of time after the kids’ afternoon naps, getting them ready, packing up the stroller and walking the 2.5 miles planning on Havana insisting on walking at least part of the way.</p>

<p>We convinced Havana to ride in the stroller so we made good time through Green Park, around Buckingham Palace, through St. James Park to the Thames. There seemed to be a Sri Lankan-related rally around Parliament, I assume about the Tamil leader who was killed.</p>

<p>We made it this far by 4:45pm and there’s a Fuller’s Pub conveniently located right there, <a href="http://www.pubs.com/pub_details.cfm?ID=233">The Red Lion</a>, so we stopped in for a pint. It amazes me how full pubs are after work in London. All the pubs have people spilling out into the street and there’s rarely a seat inside. Yet it’s still quick to get in and to get a beer. Brits really know how to live.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3549998006/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3395/3549998006_14c632d536.jpg" alt="The Red Lion Pub" /></a></p>

<p>We walked over the Westminster Bridge and up to the London Eye. The Fast-track tickets worked, we printed our tickets at the machine and were escorted right up to the front of the line and were in our capsule in minutes.</p>

<p>Havana loved it. She immediately positioned herself right by the glass and started pointing out everything she saw below. The capsule behind us had a little girl in it too and they waved at each other. She ran around the capsule checking out the different views. It was a less impressive to me… aside from Parliament and the river, there’s not much to see around London. London is sprawling, but not all that scenic from the air; it’s much more scenic from the ground, IMO.</p>

<p>After the London Eye, Havana insisted on walking. We walked back over the Hungerford Bridge, into Charring Cross, through Trafalgar Square, down the Mall into St. James Park, back into the Mayfair area looking for a place to have dinner. By this time it was 8pm and we needed to get the kids to bed, so we just came back to our neighborhood and got Indian food to go.</p>

<p>Total walking: 5.7 miles (thanks <a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/">Google Pedometer</a>!).</p>

            <p>After getting a late start due to napping, we walked to Hyde Park and went to a playground there for Havana to play. Then we walked (too far) to have a beer and a snack for the kids at The Iron Duke. We walked home through a shopping district, down Piccadilly and back to our apartment.</p>

<p>While Gay put the kids to bed, I ordered take-out dinner from an Italian place down the street. We watched TV from home over Slingplayer and went to bed.</p>

            <p>Mark and Lee came to our hotel, we had some wine and cheese and caught up since we saw them last May (<a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/18/vancouver-3/">in Vancouver</a> and <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/29/mark-lee-eric-and-dinner/">at our house</a> for Lee’s birthday). We then went out to get Indian food to bring back and have dinner at our place.</p>

            <p>We’re not quite as adjusted to London time as we expected we’d be. Havana and Hudson both woke up at 1am and had trouble getting back to sleep. So we all ended up sleeping in too long.</p>

<p>After Havana’s nap we went for a walk to Belgravia. Once again, Havana insisted on walking on her own rather than ride in the stroller. We were heading to <a href="http://www.pubs.com/pub_details.cfm?ID=242">The Star Tavern</a>, a very old Fuller’s pub, where I could get Fuller’s ESB and we could get lunch. This place is famous because it is where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Train_Robbery_(1963)">The Great Train Robbery</a> was planned and where celebrities frequented in the 1960s.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.waitrose.com/branches/branchdetails.aspx?uid=665">Waitrose</a> grocery store was nearby so we stopped there to get some real coffee (instant coffee is provided in our apartment, expecting you to drink tea) and some wine and cheese to serve when Mark &amp; Lee visit this evening.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>I remembered that last time we landed in London July 7, 2005, we found ourselves in the middle of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_July_2005_London_bombings">a terrorist attack</a> just a couple hours after it happened. That was a surreal experience, but fortunately, nothing like that happened this time.</p>

<p>After checking into the hotel, we walked around the area a bit before going to a pub for dinner. The downstairs was full so we had to go upstairs for a table, which meant we had to take Havana out of the stroller even though she was fast asleep. I picked her up but she didn’t wake up. I heard a loud “pop” and realized she dropped her milk bottle and, this has never happened before, the top popped off and splattered milk all over.</p>

<p>We eventually got the kids and the stroller upstairs and sat down at a table to feed Hudson. They were temporarily out of <a href="http://www.fullers-ales.com/london_pride.php">London Pride</a>, as close as London gets to Budweiser popularity-wise (not taste-wise), so we got a couple pints of cask-conditioned <a href="http://www.greenekingipa.co.uk/">Greene King IPA</a> and <a href="http://www.wellsandyoungs.co.uk/wellsandyoungs/beers/ales/courage-directors-bitter">Courage Directors Bitter</a>. I’m not sure what it is, but cask-conditioned beers taste better in London than they do in the US. This is good because cask-conditioned is very common here. Fuller’s London Pride is everywhere in London but <a href="http://www.fullers-ales.com/esb.php">Fuller’s ESB</a>, my favorite, isn’t. I asked the bar maid why this is and she said she had never heard of it! Hmmm. I need to get to a Fuller’s pub.</p>

<p>For dinner, I got the Fish &amp; Chips, something impossible to not get right in London. Gay took a gamble and got the Sunday roast special. I made the better choice. By this time, London Pride was back on tap so we each got a pint of it before finishing dinner and deciding to get two tired kids back home. Havana has an indepenent streak so she demanded to walk down the stairs by herself saying “I do it! I do it!”. We waited at the bottom of the stairs and with half the people in the bar watching her, Havana finally made it down. She walked about 10 blocks all the way home by herself.</p>
