              <p>We checked out of our apartment in London by 11am and went straight to Paddington Station where we took the Heathrow Express to the new Terminal 5 at Heathrow. <a href="http://www.terminal5.ba.com/us/">Terminal 5</a> is a huge new terminal that British Airways built exclusively for itself. We flew Club World so we could go to the Club World lounge and I’m glad we did – I’ve never seen a lounge like this!</p>

<p>The place is huge and there’s food, drinks, beer, wine and a full bar all free and self-serve. There’s a big selection of magazines and newspapers from around the world, all free. There’s plenty of comfortable seating to wait for your flight. They even have showers. And this is the Club World lounge, I wonder what the First Class lounge was like! And they have a room called Kids Zone, which is a <em>sound-proof</em> room filled with toys, TVs and video games. We put Havana and Hudson in there all by themselves while we sat outside the room and ate a light lunch. Havana loved it so much she cried when she had to leave.</p>

<p>Kelly picked us up at the airport and we drove to the new Zeek’s Pizza in West Seattle to get pizza to take home. We went inside to order and wait while enjoying a good ol’ American craft beer. A pizza place in Seattle has a bigger and better beer selection than your typical pub (or <em>any</em> pub I went to)  in London. I love Seattle.</p>

<p>Gay’s dad and aunt and Illy were waiting patiently for us to get home at 7:30pm. By this time we were tired, as it was 3:30am to us. It was all we could do to stay up until 9:30pm. We had to pull Havana away from playing choo-choos with Gay’s dad and aunt.</p>

              <p>We got back to London at noon and got into our apartment by 2pm. For dinner, we walked down to our old neighborhood (<a href="http://www.mayfair-london.co.uk/shepherd_market.htm">Shepherd’s Market</a>) to order Indian take-away, took that home, ate it, gave the kids a bath and put them to bed.</p>

              <p>The two best things about Brussels: the train ride in and the train ride out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/3603393647/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3592/3603393647_44fe169016.jpg" alt="IMG_0893" /></a></p>

<p>I had high hopes for Brussels, but the food is mediocre, not very French at all like we expected. I’m sick of french fries, they serve them with <em>everything</em>. But what happened to the Belgian custom of mayo for the fries? The really good beers (Chimay, Duvel, etc.) can be bought in America, the rest are good but not good enough to write home blog about. The city is deteriorating, dirty, graffiti-filled and is under construction almost everywhere you go (did I miss a recent war in Belgium?). Their streets change names every block or so and the names are so long they don’t fit legibly on maps. Their milk sucks, Havana went on a milk strike and she’d drink milk all day if we let her. It’s more expensive than even London.</p>

<p>On the positive side, the people are friendly, the waffles are very good (they’re snacks, not breakfast choices) and a few square blocks of the city has beautiful old buildings.</p>

<p>I suppose it also follows that drinking sparkling (carbonated) water is better than still water after exercise.</p>

              <p>We walked to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Place">Grand Place</a> and found (possibly the only) brewpub in Brussels, <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/3443/?view=beerfly">Les Brasseurs</a>, right off the square with a great view so we went there for lunch. The beer was pretty good. I had the Tripel and Gay had the Dark. The Dark was very nice and sweet. But they were also very expensive at €7.50 and €9 each. That’s $10.63 and and $12.76 for a 16 oz (500ml) beer! Even in London, where beers are served in Imperial pints (20 fl oz), I don’t recall paying nearly that much. That’s what you pay for drinking beer overlooking the biggest tourist spot in Belgium. The food wasn’t all that great either. I’ll never complain about $4.50 beers in the US again.</p>

<p>After lunch, we went to a couple hotels we found online to see if they had a room that would work for us with 2 kids. We usually try to get suites that have a room separate from the beds so we can put the kids to bed early and we can stay up later. That’s hard to find here, but we ended up getting two adjoining rooms instead, which we now realize is even better. Two rooms always seemed excessive with just one kid, but with two, two rooms seems to work well. Plus, you get two of everything: two showers, two bathrooms, two breakfasts, two TVs, etc. They also gave us the second room for half-off. We have the impression that tourism isn’t so great these days and both hotels we visited were very willing to negotiate prices – there’s an upside to a global recession (thanks AIG and Bear Sterns)!</p>

<p>The hotel is more expensive than the apartment but the location is much better, just a few blocks from the Grand Place, a park and all the recommended restaurants. Unless you’re in love with money, we think it’s always better to trade a little more money for a better quality experience.</p>
