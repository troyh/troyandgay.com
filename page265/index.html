          </h3>
            <p>Gay was interviewed by “Red Herring”:http://www.redherring.com and the article, “Gourmet geek”:http://www.redherring.com/article.aspx?a=10846&amp;hed=Better+than+you%3a+Gourmet+geek, is up now. :)</p>

<p>I think they chose a bad photo, but Gay doesn’t like her photos wear she wears glasses, although I do. A “fluff” piece, but if someone told me a few years ago that either one of us would be in Red Herring, ….</p>

<p>More photos:</p>

            <p>Geeks sometimes stray from their gadgets and look to “improve” the world with their higher intelligence, and they often happen across food, cooking and recipes. Here’s a new one “from Slashdot”:http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/04/09/10/1734235.shtml?tid=133&amp;tid=1&amp;tid=8:</p>

<p><em>“It’s not often I post about a website, but this one is different. It is Cooking For Engineers. No big deal, you’d think - a web site about recipes and cooking. But go look at how he’s presented it. *Most recipes are designed for women, and their funny way of looking at the world.* These are very different and instantly understandable for tech geeks like us.</em> (Emphasis mine)</p>

<p>No, recipes are designed for humans. I always find it funny how engineers look at the world… if food was designed by engineers and not Mother Nature we’d have two ingredients to choose from: water and rice. Two perfect ingredients, why would you need any more than that? And, of course, we’d have thousands of rice cookers to choose from, each one adding one more bell and/or whistle! ;)</p>

          </h3>
            <p>In an “interview”:http://www.macworld.com/news/2004/09/03/joswiak/index.php with an Apple exec on the new iMac, he points out something that Apple and their customers understand but that few, if any, PC users realize about design: _ teeny little things like that that tend to, over the course of time, make people love their Mac and inspire magazines like yours, versus people getting [angry] over time at their PCs because of little things that drive them nuts_</p>

<p>One of my favorite things about my iBook is the latch to close it. It’s magnetic, so when I close it the magnet pulls the latch out so it can lock closed. On PC laptops, the latch is always sticking out, just waiting to get broken off. A 1¢ magnet makes my iBook better. Another great iBook design is the light on the plug: it’s orange when charging and green when charged. Not only is this more logical than PC laptops typical design (on when charging, off when charged; or one light on when charging, another one when charged), but its location is more logical than simply throwing an LED on the side of the laptop the way PCs do.</p>

<p>It really is the little things that make you love products.</p>
